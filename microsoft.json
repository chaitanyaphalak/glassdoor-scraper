Most of the questions were behavioral, such as tell me about this project you've completed, tell me about yourself, why Microsoft, etc. I had to do several role-plays, such as handling a frustrated customer who doesn't want to talk to me or an angry customer who demands reimbursement, etc. I was asked to explain a segment of code in C++ ( because I listed it on my resume) and explain which hardware component in a computer is most brittle. Some other interviewees also were asked questions like guess a number from 1-20, what would you do if tomorrow is the end of the world, etc, but I weren't asked such questions.

After these interviews, a decision will be made about your offer in two weeks.After having gone through many interviews for technical roles, I found Microsoft's process to be needing the most improvement. The employees interviewing seemed as though they disliked the job via their demeanor and and answers to questions posed about work-life balance, as well as the average hours a Microsoft employee will work per week. Furthermore, Microsoft did not offer much in terms of \"selling\" their company to a future employee, as compared to other company's candidacy process. No tour throughout the campus, no Microsoft gear to take home, and no real connections to any of the current employees.Overall, this process made it seem like Microsoft was a very demanding corporation that did not offer much for employees with a life outside of work, but the trip to Seattle was a fun experience.",

I wish I had only three people to interview, because a little bit easier to interview. The current TAM new at asking questions I think, because some of the questions were not questions I had experienced in terms of behavioral questions. He seemed new at asking questions.According to the people at Microsoft you are considered the best of the best and just want to confirm that. Relax if you can. I was excited to be there, that I think the excitement came thru as nerves. Overall friendly group, but mostly behavioral questions that I had not seen here when researching or encountered before. Was told last minute only have one location to choose from for the MACH program and that definitely considering for the TAM role. It was the place near or outside of Dallas. I am not interested in the Dallas location. Usually allow to choose from three offices. I wanted to go Bellavue, WA.

        "details": "After being referred for a PM internship, I interviewed on my college campus. This was a brief, 30-minute interview, which consisted of a few behavioral questions and one coding question on the whiteboard. It was a relatively simple question about sorting characters in an array. Overall, it wasn't too difficult, but I flubbed the whiteboard question. Fortunately, I realized my mistake and told it to my interviewer (this was when\u2026\u00a0 most of the interview time was up, so there was no time to correct it on the board).A few weeks later, I heard that I had passed the first round, but PM internships for that summer were full. My recruiter encouraged me to contact her the following Fall, when I was interviewing for full-time roles. I did, and I went straight to final rounds in Redmond that Fall.My onsite was one of the \"interview circuit\" days, where 70-80 people (all interviewing for different roles) were interviewed at the same time. Most people had 3-4 interviews. It was hectic and nervewracking, but Microsoft took care of all the logistics, and all of the interviewers were very energetic, friendly, and conversational. In fact, I can easily say this was the most fun day of onsite interviews I've ever had. All of my questions for onsites were behavioral / experience and design questions, which was slightly surprising. I expected a coding question or two.Just before lunch, a recruiter pulled me aside and asked if I was available for a fifth interview. (Make sure you clear your schedule for the whole day for an onsite.) This last one was with a Group Program Manager at Microsoft, and just like the other interviewers, he was friendly, energetic, and conversational. He asked a few experience and behavioral questions, and we ended the day with an interesting design question.I interviewed on a Friday, and on the following Tuesday I got a phone call from my recruiter, saying that I would receive an offer!Overall, it was a wonderful, challenging, and fun experience. There was a lot of dead time when my recruiter was waiting to hear back from various departments to schedule a phone screen, hear back from the interviewers from phone screen, submit me for final rounds, schedule final rounds, get airfare for final rounds, etc. Aside from all the waiting, the interview process was extremely smooth, and really, genuinely fun.",

Questions include, \"how many\u2026\u00a0 hours do you want to work?\" \"Why Microsoft\" and etc... Very easy.2. You're going to receive an email about a group interview that you must attend. The group interview is like a selection test, the management will choose the best candidates for the job and offer them a call back for a 3rd 1v1 interview. How do you make yourself stand out? BE ENERGETIC AND FULL OF LIFE. Microsoft really wants people that can talk loudly and inspire others, so don't be afraid to yell random things for fun! The whole group interview lasts about 2 hours and its filled with fun games like, introduce your partner to the whole group and also provides a presentation about Microsoft's history and benefits. NOTE: You don't have to be super tech smart. Im a tech guy and I'm in school for computer science, but i was able to show my wild and energetic side. My friend, who knows WAY more about tech than me, didn't get hired. Also, for heavens sake, PLEASE answer all of the questions the management have because they want you to actively participate. Don't be afraid to asks question either.3. SUPER IMPORTANT PART; READ CAREFULLY.\u00a0I received an email from one of the managers for my 1v1 interview. I walked in to a hotel and we interviewed in a hotel room and they even provided water, it was a very comfortable setting. You will interview with two Assist Managers (at the same time). I will write the interview questions below. Okay, SUPER IMPORTANT PART. SO, i guess there is a \"SECRET\" interview with the store manager, which will only be given if you really are chosen for the job. Basically at the end of my interview with the two Assist Managers, they asked me if i wanted to stay and talk to the store managers. One of the other candidates told me she heard a rumor stating, \"if you're offered the final interview, you're most likely getting the job\" However, I could be wrong!4. 2 weeks later i got a call back for the job. yaaaaay.",

My second interview was a one-on-one where I really just sat and chatted about the company with my interviewer. He said they didn't have any more questions to ask me.

Think of Technet documentation on minimum specs, etc. This interview also covered my current salary (which was required to proceed\u2026\u00a0 with the interview) and made sure I was OK with travelling.Next, I was interviewed by two senior level PFEs over Skype. They were extremely knowledgeable but were very friendly at the same time. This interview was probably the toughest interview I've ever had. Their job is basically to drill down to the level where you have to say \"I don't know\". I was able to answer most questions, and they skipped an entire major component of the product I work with because I was able to answer everything to their satisfaction. Instead, they chose to focus on my weaker areas and kept pressing until I had to tell them I was unsure of the answer. Apparently this is totally fine and they aren't expecting perfect answers. They simply want to make sure you understand the product to the level they expect and didn't just go out and memorize the tech answers for the first interview.The last interview was more like a conversation than an interview. I traveled on-site and met with a director and the hiring manager. They were very laid back and mostly just talked about my goals, what the job was like, where I saw myself in 5 years, what working for Microsoft is like, etc. They did have a few basic questions but nothing difficult.

        "details": "My process began with a screening interview that got a bit technical, I was asked about the projects i'd worked on school. Questions like how many lines of code i'd written in total. I must have done well on this interview since I was invited out to Washington for on-campus interviews.The night before the interviews we all went for a fancy dinner at this sushi place and got to meet\u2026\u00a0 each other. That was kinda cool, I got to hear about other people's backgrounds and stories.We were all being interviewed for a focus called Customer Facing Technologist which has 4 different roles that vary by how technical or how people facing you are. To be clear, Customer in these roles meant corporate clients. The positions included Technical Account Manager, Associate Consultant, Field Engineer, and Project Manager. The weird things is that nobody knew which specific position we we're all being hired for, everything was kept super vague which messed with our ability to prepare for the interviews.The next day we each had two rounds of interviews. We were told that we'd have a 2-on-1 interview where we had to present on any topic we were passionate about to two Microsoft staff, and then a second 1-on-1 interview. My second interview however, ended up being another 2-on-1. Both interviews went well, the first pair asked me questions related to my presentation. On the other hand, the second was more technical, and since I made it pretty clear that I didn't want to get my hands in the code - leaning more toward the Technical Account Manager position - I was asked hypothetical questions related to managing accounts. With these questions it seemed they were looking for very specific answers/solutions and I was drilled until i mentioned the right word or phrase.After the interviews, we were given cool Microsoft hoodies, and free Taxi-ride vouchers. We all felt pretty good about the whole experience. We were put up in nice hotels and given a generous meal reimbursement credit of $75 per day. The interviewers were all very nice, and did a great job of making us feel welcome and comfortable.I ultimately was not given an offer, but I wasn't torn up by it since I actually applied for a design position; Not sure how I got fit into the Customer Facing Technologist bunch but during the interview, especially reviewing my resume, the interview seemed to give off a sense that I would be bored at the job and not using my real skillset.",

Interview rooms were not booked or double booked, and the people I was interviewing with had also been double booked with other candidates. It was very awkward to show up in a room and find another candidate in it.Aside from that, all the interviewers were nice and had good questions. Most questions were focused on machine learning, and most of the questions were extremely similar across interviewers. Nobody asked me to code a single line of code, and almost everybody asked me how to deal with a categorical variable with high cardinality.At the end I found the interview process easy, almost easy to a point it raised a red flag (if you hire someone based on this process, what's the risk I'll have to work with not qualified people?).After a week of silence my recruiter reached out with good news. He was very robotic and essentially threw at my the compensation package assuming that I had no option but accept it. No fuss at all, no feedback asked, no asking me if I had questions.A year earlier I had experienced a Google interview process, and while I was not offered a position in that case, the recruiter had been 100 times more personable in turning me down than the Microsoft recruiter had been in extending an offer.I give thumbs up to the Microsoft team and their people, and thumbs down to their HR.",

        "details": "I got an interview through an employee referral through email introductions.I met up with the hiring manager in person instead of doing a phone screening to learn more about the team and what they were looking for and got an onsite interview.A typical designer's interview process consists of:- 60 min presentation- 60 min design challenge white boarding- 60 min lunch interview- 60 min each 4-6 1:1 interviewThe presentation is fairly\u2026\u00a0 easy if you have work to show. I showed 3 works and in depth talking about the problems, my design process and the challengers I faced and how I overcame them and the results of the project. At the end people we ask questions and mainly for clarifications. I made sure I put effort into the look of my presentation and added some personal touches to it such as photos and talked a bit about myself so they can relate to me.The design challenge I thought was strange. They gave me a sheet or requirements and they stressed they were looking at how \"creative\" I was. Keyword here. I couldn't really ask questions before hand regarding the challenge because it took me a while to read (1 page) and left me alone for 60 mins so you have to state your assumptions and make your case clear and walk through your design. I was asked to design a calendar with XYZ requirements. After 60 mins they (I had about 5-6 ppl) will come in and ask a lot of questions and a lot of \"what ifs\". Unfortunately I know my solution wasn't as \"creative\" as they would've wanted because it isn't the way I solve problems (especially in a vacuum with no collaboration and under pressure). They really wanted someone who was innovative even though I knew the role I applied for required someone who could balance all the requirements which I believe I did according to the sheet. I really enjoyed our discussion and bantering afterwards and made me solve the problem in a different way but in reality I know I wouldn't have solved it that way because I like designing things that I know is shippable and maintainable in the long term while achieving business, technical and user goals. It really helps being collaborative (if they had allowed it in the beginning..). If you're an out of the box thinking you may do well. They wanted to see more breath than depth and more conceptual ideas than actually getting the job done (which I am better at).After that I had lunch with the hiring manager, he was really digging into why Microsoft and why this team, why did you leave your last company etc. and asking really tough questions. He really wanted to extract as much red flags as he could from me. I felt like I was being set up for failure during that interview. I could tell he already didn't feel I was a good fit and was looking for not design skills but more of the soft skills of dealing with difficult people and influencing them.After lunch I was told I wasn't senior enough for the role but I should try other roles and that was the end of my interview loops.Throughout the whole interview process, they were very nice and clear to me what they wanted to see and really wanted me to succeed and was very obvious what answers they wanted out from me, unfortunately I didn't go that route because I also wanted to make sure I wasn't saying things just to please them in order to get the job, I chose to respond as honestly as I could because I also wanted to make sure Microsoft and the team was a good fit for me.At the end I believe Microsoft wasn't a good fit for me and this has been a positive experience.",

Of course I said yes!The questions themselves were basic - it was a fit interview with questions like walk me through your CV, tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult client, etc. The\u2026\u00a0 part I found disappointing was what seemed to be complete disinterest from my interviewer. She phoned me late and left the call early. She didn't know the answers to my questions, and typed extremely loudly during the entire interview, making it difficult to concentrate. I tried to engage in normal conversation while speaking with her, but she didn't seem interested at all, and didn't say much at all besides asking the questions. She didn't even introduce herself, not even her name (which I learned from Skype) until I asked about her background at the end! Overall, it was an uncomfortable experience for me, when I had read that Microsoft first interviews tend to be very conversational and more of a get-to-know-you interview. Even more frustrating was that the interview was with someone I'd never met, in Seattle, by phone (but not video), when I'd been in contact for many months with a recruiter from my area, in the region in which I would have actually liked to have the job. It was unfortunate and disappointing, but I guess some things like this are luck-based and vary greatly depending on the recruiter and their mood that day.",

        "details": "I am posting and rating this interview experience as negative only because of one person(Sr SDE) that was involved in the process, I will get back to her behavior later. First thing first,Hiring manager and product manager were really nice persons, they were very professional. My first interview was with product manager, which went for 45 min and I was asked some ethical, behavioral and product related questions. My 2nd\u2026\u00a0 interview was a technical loop with Sr SDE, about which I will discuss later in a separate paragraph. My 3rd interview was with Hiring manager, which lasted beyond time limit of 60 min, I was asked some tough questions but we both were enjoying conversation and he seemed impressed with my talk and experience. After the interview I was told by hiring manager that he will take hiring decision by eod tom only as he will meet everyone today evening or tom morning. After the interview I had the gut feeling that I nailed it, as I aced all 3 interviews. Though I can't comment on how my answers to behavioral and ethical questions were taken, but for some questions,I was told on the spot by product manager that what I answered was a correct answer and this was to test core values. My only concern was technical interview even though I nailed every question asked, because of behavior and conduct of interviewer, now lets jump to what happened in technical round.I was introduced to Sr SDE( who was a tester for most of her career at MS, I think she was made SDE because of last year's changes in MS) by Product Manager. It was supposed to be a lunch interview for about 90 min, with lunch from 12:00 to 12:30 and from 12:30 to 1:30 continue interview in conference room. I greeted this lady but I was not given any response. She ignored the schedule and directly took me to conference room for interview. She didn't had copy of my Resume, I had 4/5 copies of my resume with me, so I shared one with her. She asked me a TSQL question on white board, which I resolved in like 5 sec, she then got surprised and tried to made it complicated, I resolved that too quickly, then she asked me what if each of these intervals are dynamic in nature, I resolved that too, she told me it will not work, I told her lets test to check and it worked. She accepted that it will work. Then she asked me ranking function related TSQL question, which again I resolved in 10 sec, she then asked me how you will test it. I told her about 7/8 test cases and how you can write all these in VS DB unit testing project. My resume has lot of other stuff like Big data, Machine learning, Python, Java and data science. It was very clear that she didn't had any experience with any of these as she completely ignored asking any question related to these. She then asked me how you will predict sales amount for our product, which is very open ended question, I talked about it for like 10 min(discussed different feature selection, model selection and validation tech and challenges around curse of dimensionality and how to take care of it) and it became clear that she didn't understood what I am talking and also she didn't asked me a single follow up question. Only question she asked me, how much out of these I have implemented. With her facial expression and postures I became sure that she didn't came prepared for interview and she also don't know much about ML/data science/Datawarehouse/Big Data/MPP and analytical technologies, for which she was supposed to interview me. She then asked me do you know .NET(not listed on my resume). I said no I don't , but then she replied, oh you know Java( I said yes as it was on my resume, expecting some follow up algorithm question or oop question), but she didn't asked me any question related to algorithm or OOP. She then ended interview asking if I have any questions. After the interview she took me to lunch area in Microsoft and though it was a lunch interview sponsored by MS, I PAID FROM MY POCKET FOR THE LUNCH as she pointed me to pay! After that she just wanted to leave me unattended(Though my MS issued ID said, I should be escorted all times for security reasons), I asked her can I sit in the conference room till start of my next interview, she replied yes and then she asked me to walk myself to hiring manager room after 15 min and she left me unescorted for next 15 min. I greeted her before she left, she didn't replied back and just left. Only idea I got at the end of this interview with her was that she didn't liked me at all from the very go. Later it took me 5 min to search for hiring manager room.Though I am none to comment on the competencies and professional behavior of any individual. But this is the last thing I was expecting from a Microsoft Senior Software Developer. I would definitely like Microsoft HR to look into this issue.",

They don't necessarily expect correct answers to all of those questions, but they want you to exhibit a strong technical proficiency and grace under pressure.",

Interviews were straight forward and more conversational around my work history and my thoughts on Microsoft.Where they can make improvements is around the transparency and focus on job roles. It's not entirely clear what role you are interviewing for since each person gets about 4-5 different potential job roles and verticals that they can slot into. Makes for a nightmare in terms of preparations. One of the candidates didn't even know what vertical or job he was interviewing for since his recruiter did not provide him any information.

        "details": "I was referred by a friend who had started 4 months prior. I applied for the CSA position on careers.microsoft.com. Having an internal referral seemed to help me get my foot in the door. Once referred, a recruiter contacted me to make sure my information was up to date as well as offer their assistance if there were other jobs for which I'd like to apply.Soon thereafter the hiring manager\u2026\u00a0 contacted me to chat about the position and to make sure I was still interested. He also mentioned another position that was similar but not yet posted. I was interested in both positions after the conversation.A couple weeks later, I talked to an interview scheduler who wanted to ensure I'd be free on an upcoming Friday. They were planning on doing the interview in their regional office which is about 3 hours from my home. I was free and they said they'd get back to me in a day or two. About a week passed until I heard back that they had decided to do the interviews in my city after all. I was scheduled for an interview on a Friday in late April.I arrived for the interview early wearing a suit with no tie. All the posts I've read said that they don't care a whole lot about what you wear, but dress nice and be comfortable. I did not feel under dressed during the process and I was more comfortable sans tie.I met with 4 individuals including the hiring manager, a technical resource, a sales representative and another individual. My last interviewer had told me to wait around because the hiring manager wanted to talk to me again. I think some wires were crossed because I waited 45 minutes and was about to leave when I happened to see the hiring manger in the hall and was able to ask him if he was still wanting to chat. He seemed surprised but obliged and we talked for a bit longer. They were all obviously interested in chatting about the two roles (one of which I had formally applied for and one that was not \"yet\" posted). Overall, I had a really good feeling about it all and was optimistic that I would hear back from them with good news. After all, I had essentially interviewed for two positions at once and all feedback so far was great.I was told at the start of this that I'd hear back from the recruiter(s) within 10 business days after the interviews one way or another. I had 2 contacts that were given to me earlier and expected to hear from one of them. After 7 days I was getting a bit impatient and reached out via email. I did not hear back, which was fine since I still had a few days to go. I emailed the recruiters periodically over the next 2 to 3 weeks. The 2 recruiters did not get back to me, but the interview scheduler was responsive and was working on my behalf to get the recruiters to call me. I appreciated her very much during this process.4 weeks after the interview I had still not heard back from anyone. I was getting a little frustrated by this time and decided it wouldn't hurt to contact the hiring manager directly. We had talked on the phone and emailed before the interview so I didn't feel like this was huge breach of protocol. I emailed the hiring manger and the recruiters separately on the same day, for what I assumed would be the last time. I didn't plan on drawing the process out anymore at this time.I heard back from the recruiter the next day with his sincerest apologies for how long this had taken. He scheduled a phone call to discuss my interview and application process for the next day. We had the phone call and it was helpful, but he was unable to tell me if I was moving forward or not. He told me all the feedback was positive and that he was going to reach out to the hiring manager to get more information.The next morning the hiring manager emailed me back apologizing as well for the slow turn around, but he alluded to the recruiting team dropping the ball. He asked if I wanted to have a phone call later that day or the next morning. I emailed him back immediately stating I was free after 1 o'clock that day or I could open up my morning the next day. I never heard back from him.I reached out to the recruiter a week later since he had still not contacted me as promised. No reply. I reached out to the hiring manager one last time 3 weeks later to no avail.A few days ago, (2 1/2 months since my interview) the friend who originally referred me contacted me to tell me he had just heard the position was filled by an internal candidate. By this time, I was just glad to get some closure.Overall, leading up to and including the interview was very positive. After the interview the lack of feedback and letting me hang in the wind was pretty unprofessional. Especially since they stated several times that I'd hear back either way. Thankfully, I am employed. I would be very upset had I continued to hold out hope for this position while between jobs.",

Then was invited to Redmond for a final round of interviews, and here's where everything went bad.My first interviewer right off the bat wanted me to write the Shunting yard\u2026\u00a0 algorithm without a stack, which on its own even with a stack isn't that intuitive of an algorithm unless you've memorized it. Then the rest of the interviews were just as bad with a series of low level programming questions, none of which I was prepared for as I wasn't interviewing for a low level programming or a full-time job.In general, was very upset about the later half of the process and the time I put in preparing in order to just be evaluated on topics I was told I wouldn't need to worry about.",

It turned out to be ironic, as the senior interviewer in round 1 asked me how I would solve a certain problem they were facing, as I had been doing the exact same work on my current program, albeit at a much smaller scale. He was very unhappy with my vague answers, but I was not about to explain exactly how my team solved the problem, as it was proprietary to my current company. Strike one.The second round consisted of 2 junior to mid-level team members who were new to the team within the last 2 years. Very energetic, asked typical and some odd questions. When I asked them to describe the job, they spent a lot of time detailing the long hours and hard work they were doing, but not much time about the actual problems or tasks. Strike two.The last round consisted of normal interview questions until half way through. The interviewer slid a few sheets of paper across the table and explained it was a set of questions he used to give to candidates he interviewed when he ran a consulting company. He told me I had 20 minutes to answer the questions and then left the room. The HR recruiter from Redmond specifically told me that no tests would be given in any interviews, as that was an issue they had previously dealt with in their culture, but I found it annoying because I was interviewing for a PM position vice technical. Despite answering the questions to what appeared to be satisfactory when the interviewer returned and reviewed, I was no longer willing to be interviewing. Strike three.Unexpectedly, the junior team member from the first round returned and asked if he could spend some time with me, as the senior member from his round monopolized the time (trying to pry proprietary info from me). This was the only normal and relevant conversation I had all day, but unfortunately by this point, I was acutely aware I was not a good fit for the culture. As I walked out, I saw the signs on the various conference room doors and discovered that the focus area of the questions I had been asked in all of the interviews was the topic of the conference.

        "details": "[TLDR: The worst interview experience of my life. The Microsoft recruitment team did a terrible job.]I met with a recruiter on my university's campus in October 2015 and gave her my resume. I told her I was interested in a hardware intern position but she set me up with an interview for the software internship instead. I asked her about it in an email response and she told me that\u2026\u00a0 if I could get a job in software, I could just switch to hardware once I got there for the summer. I had an on-campus interview which seemed to go well. Mostly behavioral and experiential questions with one coding question. The interviewer kept cutting my responses off which was unsettling.I followed up with a thank you and my recruiter told me I would hear back in 3 weeks. 3 weeks goes by and I still haven't heard a response so I send a follow up. The recruiter gets back to me and tells me to wait two more weeks. I don't get a response in two weeks so I send a follow up. The recruiter tells me I move on to the next round of interviews and connects me to a new recruiter. The new recruiter tells me that I will be interviewing in person and that I should be in contact with a scheduler within the next two weeks to set up an interview time. I told her about my situation about wanting to work in hardware and she said that it should be fine. The scheduler sends me an email asking for three dates that I could make it during which she tells me I will be interviewing in Raleigh, NC. I give the three dates and she responds with a form for me to fill out with the final date. This is beginning/mid January 2016 at this point). I don't hear any confirmation on my flight or hotel within two weeks (end of January 2016). I send a follow up and the scheduler responds saying she had been sending to the wrong email address (I'm very frustrated at this point). She also says that there are no more positions in Raleigh so I will be interviewing in Seattle....I finally get flight confirmation and I'm in Seattle and have confirmation for my first interview at 11am the next morning. I wake up early around 8am and luckily so because around 8:25am I get a call from my scheduler saying she told me the wrong time and location of my interview. I was actually supposed to meet with a recruiter at 8:30am at a location that was 30min away from my hotel. I have two and a half heart attacks and tell her I don't have transportation and she tells me to grab a Microsoft shuttle. She also reassures me that this won't count against me and she has alerted my interviewers of the mistake. I quickly get ready and make it to the first interview by 9:20am. I unfortunately never got to meet with a recruiter so I didn't even know what team I was interviewing with when I got there. I found out I am meeting with CDM (load management) from my first interviewer because I had to ask and I felt unprepared and unprofessional about that. Before I had been told that I was just interviewing for Microsoft in general and not a specific team, but my interviewer tells me up front I am interviewing for an internship with the CDM team (remember that I wanted to be in hardware in the first place and was told I could switch if I got the job). He gave me a schedule for the rest of the day and the interviews seemed to go well from there. I had three 50-min interviews back to back, and lunch was right after my second interview. The questions were all iterating through arrays in some way or another. Pretty standard questions, but considering I am a computer engineering student with a focus in computer architecture, I felt out of my comfort zone (remember that I wanted a hardware position in the first place). All three interviewers were nice, but they didn't ask any behavioral questions and one or two experiential questions which tells me that they are just ultimately looking for code monkeys instead of collaborators and innovators.At the end of the day, I was told to go meet the recruiter that I was originally supposed to meet with in the morning back at the recruitment building. When I get there and check in, I am told he is too busy and to send him an email with my thoughts of how it went. He sends a quick response telling me I will hear back within a week. Two days later I get a formal no from him saying that I should wait a year to apply before reapply for a position at Microsoft.Overall, this was the most horrible interviewing experience that I have ever had, and probably anyone will ever have at Microsoft. I see this case as an anomaly for the company, but I feel obligated to share my feedback. I felt like they weren't even going to hire me and they were just hoping that along the way I would give up and not follow up.

There was a lunch in between for 30 minutes with hiring manager and a 30 minute break later on. After each interview, the interviewer would escort me to a common waiting area and bring the next interviewer with them a few minutes later.Since I only had 4 interviews scheduled, I was pretty much ready to go home at 3 PM. But learnt from the hiring manager that they had one more person who wanted to speak to me. I was led to that person's office and spoke to them for another hour. At this point I was almost completely exhausted and ready to go home but was told that there was just one more person yet. This was probably the hardest interview of all. In the end I learnt that it was an 'as appropriate' interview. I would leave the task of figuring out what 'as appropriate' interview is to the reader. Anyway so finally at 5PM they let me go.Overall three onsite interviews were purely technical and two were mix of program management and technical questions and one was behavioral or you could say 'culture fit' assessment.I was contacted by HR within a week with an offer.

The entire process from phone interview arrangement, on-site interview to final feedback lasts another 1 month.I had 1 phone interview with simple C++ question. And\u2026\u00a0 for the on-site interview I met 5 interviewers at Redmond site. It started with a brief conversation with the recruiter. After that the first interviewer took me to lunch and then just interview me after lunch. All the interviews are conducted in a meeting room. There's one 30min break in the afternoon, and for that break I had to exit the office area and just wait and relax at the reception lobby. The difficulty of the interview questions are slightly above average, but fair enough for this position.Because C++ has not been my working language for 2 years, one of my friend who works at Microsoft suggested me to interview with my working language instead. But just in case I still practiced C++ for some days before on-site. And I was right, because all of the interviewers asked me to use C++ for white board coding.I was also told that Microsoft usually replies fast after interview, and that's true for my case. Just 1 week after on-site the recruiter called me and told me that they will not continue the process. He also told me that my biggest flaw was the fluency of C++. Despite they're aware of the fact that C++ has not been my working language for 2 years, from hindsight it seems to me that Microsoft really emphasize on the proficiency of C/C++/C# despite other qualification, which I'll definitely take extra care before my next application to Microsoft.",

From my understanding, the main difference is that Support Engineers need more technical depth while PFE's need more technical breadth and spend the majority of their working hours traveling and visiting customers on site.As for the interview - Microsoft is genuinely interested in finding out if you will be a good fit for the company, so relax and be yourself. The 3 month MACH training program all PFE and SE new hires go through is apparently pretty tech-intensive and very thorough, so the interview seemed to be less technical and more behavioral as Microsoft believes it can teach any intelligent, driven individual how to succeed in the role.",

I enjoyed the discussion I had with him regarding my side projects and classes and things like that. The person I talked to specifically was pretty down the earth and very honest about his opinions of the company and the work he does,\u2026\u00a0 so that was a refreshing change from someone trying to drown me kool-aid. I was contacted about a week later regarding an on campus interview.The on campus interview was, if I remember correctly, 20, maybe 30, minutes long. It was about 10 minutes of behavioral questions that was all pretty standard. Team experience, personal projects, a brief QA. Following from that, we did 1 technical question. The one I received was fairly basic and I communicated directly to the interviewer that I knew the answer immediately. From that he permitted me to write it in pythonic pseudo code for my solution. We then discussed why it was the best solution as well as other, worse solutions, to the problem. All in all a good experience. The interviewer seemed interested in me and treated me like someone actually suited to interview for the company. I received an invitation to interview on site the following week.Scheduling my onsite was a bit of a pain and from what I understand from my friends, they had similar experiences. The communication with the recruiting manager was great, but because of how responsibilities are tossed around at MSFT, it took a long time for my flight and other things to get confirmed and even when I was told I would be receiving the information on them, I never received them. If you aren't paranoid like I am, then this isn't much of a big deal.",

        "details": "I submitted my resume at one of their info sessions at my school. A week later, I was emailed to schedule a 30min interview on campus. The interview went well and was basically a discussion. Presentation of the Supply Chain and Manufacturing group and the positions within the group. He also asked me situational questions such as how do you work in teams or how often do you interact with\u2026\u00a0 your superior/professor during projects. About 4 weeks later, I was flown to Redmond,WA for a panel of interviews. 3 days all paid by Microsoft. We were a big group of several backgrounds (mostly Mechanical and Electrical engineering), all applying for an internship or full time in the Manufacturing group. The day before the interviews, we visited the campus and went to diner to meet employees of the group. It was really nice and casual. On the interview day I was part of the afternoon shift. We went to lunch on campus (paid by Microsoft) and then proceeded to the interviews. There was 4 of them, 45 min separated by a 15min break. All my interviews were strictly behavioral (surprisingly!) and I mostly talked about previous projects I had worked on and why I'd like to work there. My advice is, know your resume, be enthusiastic and ask a lot of (interesting/relevant) questions. Really show that you want this. They're not here to trick you but rather test how you'd fit in the group/company. After the interviews we went back to the hotel and went to visit Seattle with a group of interviewees (all expenses paid again). They told us we'd hear from them within 3-5 business days. I got an email the day after coming back home, saying I had an offer and then the HR scheduled a call to discuss the letter content. Overall, the process took about 7 weeks and went smoothly. The only \"down\" side, was the wait before getting invited to Redmond. However, the final response arrived quickly even for people who did not get an offer",

Two of the interviewers are from one team in Microsoft and the other two are from another team. They make hiring decisions independent of one another so you could theoretically get offers from both teams (or none). Of the four of us interview candidates from my university, we all seemed to be interview by entirely different teams.

ATTEMPTS AT CONTACTING RECRUITERS HAVE RESULTED IN NOTHING.

The person I was supposed to meet didn't attend\u2026\u00a0 due to heavy rain, and I ended up being interviewed by 3 different people (1 who called me and interviewed over the phone).I received positive feedback from all 3 interviewers, and was told I could expect to hear back in 5 to 10 business days.Microsoft PAID for my flight and hotel. As of now, 5 weeks later, I have received zero feedback from anyone at the company. My attempts at emailing have typically resulted in no response, except for the fact that the original recruiter is no longer with his staffing company and I was dumped onto someone else.I am furious that I took valuable time away from my family to travel to an in-person interview and not have the courtesy of a single phone call or email communication from anyone at the company.I'm pretty sure I would have gotten an offer if somebody at the company didn't completely screw up, but instead I've received zero communication.I'm blown away by the lack of professionalism and courtesy by Microsoft for not having the decency to follow up with candidates at all.My time is my most valuable commodity, and I will never trust Microsoft with it again. I'm a cloud technology and data expert, and Microsoft wanted me to help them with supporting Azure clients. I was abundantly qualified to do so, and if they ever contact me again I will absolutely not waste my time with them.

This interview only lasted 30 minutes and the interviewer was texting and typing throughout so I thought that I had done poorly on the previous interview and he was there because he had to be.The interviewers are all from the same group and chat in between interviews about you.

The second technical screen was incredibly difficult. The questions were worded very strangely, and required extensive knowledge of not just how the technologies worked, but how each component interacted with each other. I really though that I did bad, but the interviewer intended the questions to be difficult; I only needed a 50% to pass. The third interview was with the manager of the team I would be working with; it was a very standard round of HR questions.",

You are mostly underpaid compared to what normal US citizens are paid.4. If its a contract to hire, its a risk, what can the recruiting agency do to resolve Visa issues.5. Search W2- Payroll.Hope it helps. This is a Game Dev / related position using game engine.",

The same day, they scheduled a phone screening with the hiring manager.I got a reply back the next day from the recruiter\u2026\u00a0 and we discussed further the interview process, scheduling options, and the duration of the process. This all happened within 5 days.The following week I went in for the on-site interview and met with the hiring manager who I'd spoken to on the phone. We reviewed what was going to happen during the day, then he handed me off to the first interviewer. We spent a good amount of time talking about the fundamental power supply topologies and discussed our common experience having gone to the same graduate school.When we were finished, I got to share lunch with the next interviewer, an engineer who would tentatively be my peer in the group. Rapport was also good here. I was able to teach him a few things about the fundamentals of some electronics circuits and he seemed genuinely interested in what I could bring to the team. This all why eating; no pressure.Next was a director of another group, parallel to the hiring manager. There was little formality to this (which kept nerves in check) and his questions primarily dealt with subject matter outside of my experience so he was surprisingly gracious with expectations. He was, as was the case through most of the day, seeking how I solved the problems, not so much the exact answers.After that, I met with another engineer who would be my peer in another group. We discussed best practices of board layout and general circuit design. Again, good interaction, though not as technical as the prior discussion. He's a very quiet person, so I wasn't able to read his reactions in the interview itself, but I felt confident throughout.Another engineer; rinse & repeat. Pretty much the same questions as the previous person.Then I met again with the hiring manager who gave me some more technical questions than he'd previously asked. I was able to satisfactorily walk through the questions despite having not worked on such a circuit in some time.Finally, I met the skip-level manager of the department. He was immediately enthusiastic about my then-employer and discussed a bunch of previous encounters with them. Then he handed me a piece of paper that showed a circuit he'd previously worked on and asked me how it operated. Again, I was able to satisfactorily answer these questions. He had a meeting immediately following so I was sort of unceremoniously dismissed for the day without being able to talk further with the previous interviewers or even being escorted out of the lobby. I went home that day with a pretty good feeling about how it all went, but wasn't sure how to handle the exit.However, it was only 2 days later that I received a job offer from the recruiter and we discussed what the next steps were and when I could start. All told, the entire process from application to receiving an offer was about 2 weeks.",

        "details": "Interview process was a Gong Show and could easily be produced into a made-for-TV process with \"Yakety Sax\" as the background music.The first interviewer simply did not call back -- twice -- when she said she would (initials are T.D.). A call and e-mail back to the SF-based vendor went unanswered, then a \"one more try\" call yielded an apology for the missed times and a new appointment time. This\u2026\u00a0 time, the interview was done.Woman at Microsoft, who would have been my boss, was the most pleasant of the interview process (initials A.R.). She asked good questions, on-time, and seemed interested in what I had to offer. In fact, only 20 of the allotted 30 minutes were used before I moved on, felt good about that.Third round brought more delays and pushed back times from K.E., the vendor recruiter who works at the MSFT campus. She never called prepared, always bringing herself up-to-date while right there on the phone. I could have said I was Taylor Swift and she may have bought it.The scheduler (initials M.S., ironically) didn't seem adept to the task at hand, as it took two e-mail replies to get him to understand he didn't attach an advertised document from his first e-mail. And I never received the survey he said that would be coming regardless of the outcome of the interview process.The day came for the four-person back-to-back interviews, they didn't like me, which I can accept.I can not accept K.E., the second recruiter I worked with blaming traffic on her showing up 20 minutes late for my 30-minute prep session prior to the face-to-face interviews. That was disrespectful and distracting. All she did was rush through the compensation and benefits package and was up-front about having hired someone else for this specific position, and I was auditioning for another role that was open. I would have been better off without that negative experience and thrown into the interview process cold.Was also told I'd get a call explaining why I didn't get the job. Unsurprisingly, K.E. never called or e-mailed back.MSFT needs to work on their vendor recruiters, that's for sure.I wanted the job, but the more I learned from the people I talked to, I learned that if I got the job, it would be a...unique...environment.

I wouldn't recommend this company because their process is very long, they communicate intermittently through the process so your confused about, how the interview process works or if your date is confirmed, and they leave impersonal responses after leaving you hanging for months. If your looking for a company that appreciates their workers, I would look elsewhere, because I firmly believe that, a company should treat their potential employees with respect but the way I was treated left me, feeling sick.

        "details": "I applied to a lot of roles on the Microsoft Career Site. Out of the blue, I got an email followed by a coordinated call from a MS recruiter for a role I hadn't applied to. He explained the role the best he could, asked me a few simple data structure related questions and once I passed that, scheduled a phone screen with someone from the team.The phone screen was\u2026\u00a0 probably the hardest interview of them all. The coding question was simple, however, I came up with a non-optimal solution. I was able to rework the whole solution to an optimal one in the end. Next, he asked me some OS concepts that were pretty generic and you should know from any undergrad OS course you should have taken. Since I'd used Java as my coding language, he was wary of my abilities to handle pointers. He asked me about it and I told him that it'd been a while since I'd used them, however I was willing to answer any questions he had to test my knowledge on it. He asked me a data structure manipulation question (it shows up on many interview reviews posted here) using pointers. I had 5 minutes remaining on the call, so I did the best I could. He seemed satisfied with the solution and passed me.The on-site interviews: I drove to the office with the rental car they provided me and waited in the lobby for the recruiter. He spoke to me about what the day would look like and what I should expect. He explained that there were 4 tech interviews scheduled and if those went well, there would be a fifth one with a high-level manager.The first interview was easy, nothing much to report. Next was a lunch interview. I ended up answering all his questions and only then ate so as to not get distracted. Was a decent pizza from the cafeteria too. :)The third interview was a simple data structure manipulation question. No way that any decent CS major could screw this up. After the coding, he asked me a LOT of OS related questions. The fourth interview (and what I feared would be my last one) was the best one of the lot. The guy was pretty high up in the team and has so much energy. He started off with explaining his background and what the team does in great detail. He also asked me about my last three rounds and what I thought went well or what I could have done better. His coding question was fairly easy and I took my time and asked clarifying questions to make sure I knew exactly what he wanted. The last thing I wanted to do was screw up an easy question with a senior team member.I did end up getting to the fifth round. This was the most relaxed of the lot and the manager spoke a lot about the culture in the company and answered a lot of my questions about the role and the team. Just remember that if you can't think of asking any questions, explain that you've already asked question X or Y and this is your understanding. Sitting there with a blank expression just makes the interviewer think that you're not really interested in the role since he doesn't know what you've asked the other interviewers.After the last interview, he escorted me out of the building while we made small talk. He said that the recruiter will get back to me by possibly tomorrow. But this point, I guessed that their hiring decision was made and it was up to the recruiter to get back to me in his own time. As I sat in my car in the parking lot, I sent the recruiter an email thanking him for being very helpful and responsive through the process and that it was a pleasure working with him.A few notes: in case you didn't know, the company laid off a huge number of testers last year in their org restructuring, therefore, all devs should take on the responsibility of testing their own code thoroughly. I had this at the back of my mind and made sure that every line of code was tested as well as every corner case was at least discussed, if not taken care of (sometimes you can't write all the error checking conditions in a short span of time). So, while it may seem that the questions were easy, without clarifying questions and high-coverage test cases, you will not get an offer. One last thing is have a lot of questions prepared: what exactly is the role's duties, what is the org structure, what is the deployment cycle and workflow. Even questions like what was their worst deployment and what happened shows an interest in how the team operates (not all questions have to be interviewer pleasing!) Above all, treat the interview like a conversation between new acquaintances/friends. They want to gauge if they want to sit in an office/cubicle across from you everyday, so that interest and camaraderie is important to them as much as it is to you. This will also relax you and improve your thought process since you'll respond to any hints they may give you in case you get stuck. Finally, have fun.",

Scheduling was very easy to work with and I had no issues getting to Seattle; a rental car was even booked for me, and meals and parking can be expensed. The first interview was with the recruiter, who was very friendly and provided some insightful information on how the interviews work and a schedule with the people I would meet. She also mentioned that there were multiple teams monitoring these interviews and that if I did well in the interviews there would be additional interviews that were not on the schedule. While there was a lunch interview that was a bit more casual (no whiteboard = no coding), I didn't let my guard down; all other interviews were highly technical and required coding or analyzing code. I eventually met double the number of people I was scheduled for and the interviews lasted 7 hours. It was a gruelling day, and one interviewer asked me questions outside of my knowledge zone, but it was extremely insightful as to the difficulty level of a first-tier software tech company interview, and I learned a lot of what was being expected at Microsoft.",

No elaboration.I followed up again and heard nothing.So I went directly to the hiring manager. Never heard back. But did get an email from the recruiter the next morning withdrawing the offer.

Having had some dismal luck with job hunting, I was overwhelmed and excited.The 30-minute phone call was set\u2026\u00a0 up a couple of weeks later with the same recruiter. She asked me a good mix of questions, including some behavioral questions and a case question. They give you a lot of resources to study from and I took advantage of it, and I think this definitely helped with the phone call.It took them some time to figure out the headcount for this program, so they were able to get back to me about the on-site interview about a month later.Microsoft does an amazing job taking care of its candidates. They'll fly you in the day before your interview and you also have the option of either leaving the day of or the day after. They encourage you to get a feel for Seattle, but if you're going to work at Microsoft for a couple of years, you'll need to like where you're living.The day started at 9 a.m., and one by one, each candidate (half of us were intern candidates, the other half were full-time candidates), was pulled into a separate room by a recruiter. They briefed us about the day, asked us about any other offers we had and sent us on our way.From what I've heard (and read) on Glassdoor, if you make it past lunchtime, it's usually a good sign. I had two hour-long interviews before lunchtime, had lunch with a recent ACE Marketing hire and had three more hour-long interviews afterwards. I had a great feeling and followed up with each person I interviewed to thank them.Nearly two week later, I heard back from my onsite interview recruiter saying that I got the job!

I replied asking if they could tell me why I was rejected without even being interviewed, but she gave me no reason and the tone of her email got even worse.So, the same guy who thought I was a good match 2 weeks earlier now thought I wasn't a match without ever interviewing me....*Holy Unprofessionalism* I hope this review helps some job seekers as well as the recruiters/hiring managers within Microsoft. Hopefully others don't have to endure similar \"interviews\"",

First day was a group interview, in which 30-40 individuals were taken into a presentation room and shown a video racked with so much cheese, and fabricated excitement, supposedly depicting how much energy and excitement pumped out of individuals working at Microsoft Retail Stores. Participation was the \"key\" to being asked to come back the\u2026\u00a0 following day for interviews with 3 different representatives of Microsoft, one of which was with the store manager. Was given the green light for the 2nd day of interviews, in which I thought went very well, although I only interviewed twice...the first of which was with 2 individuals, one extremely pleasant, and the other, extremely curious. That interview ended with a sincere welcoming smile, a jovial handshake, and the words \"I look forward to working with you in the near future.\" The second interview was with the Store manager, who I thought was being really cool, and not really engaging me much as he finished notes from his previous interview for most of the time we were sharing oxygen in the same space. I figured this was a good sign, and that he already felt so comfortable with me, due to the fact that Microsoft initiated contact with me, completely unsolicited (I had not even applied for this, nor any other position with Microsoft), about the position, saying they were certain this role fit me like a glove (technically, most will define that I was \"shortlisted\"), so I didn't think anything of it, and overall had a great feeling that I would receive an offer, as was nearly affirmed when first contacted by Microsoft.They advised me that I would hear something in 7-10 days. I departed feeling wondrous, like my life was finally starting to change for the better. 3 weeks to a little over a month passed, and the only information I was given from my recruiter, after several attempts to make contact, was via email; They were still working on the offers, and that they would be sent out in the next few days. This news kept me hanging out next to my mailbox for an additional 2 weeks (JUST CRUEL), and then I finally received an email from the recruiter that I had not been selected for the position. I didn't receive the official notice from Microsoft until nearly 2.5 months had passed.As you can probably imagine, I was devastated, and felt extremely foolish for thinking that something good, something that I was deserving of, was going to happen in my life, that might just end up saving me from utter demise of all self confidence, and self worth.",

Find the correct baskets in one attempt by picking a fruit from any basketAdvice: Impress your interviewer by marketing your skills well and back it up with the work you have done.I was flown in to Seattle and based in a Redmond hotel a night before my on-site interview. On the day of the interview a Microsoft cab picks you up from the airport and takes you to their Recruiting building. There were many other candidates, but they were mainly for internships.You meet with your designated recruiter who is your point of contact post-interview. As mentioned in other reviews, talk nicely with this recruiter and highlight your skill and more importantly your passion for Microsoft. This recruiter has a say in your final yes or no decision.Had 5 interviews on-site with 5 senior engineers/managers. Each interviewers experience at Microsoft progresivelly increased- ranging from 10 years to 25 years. Each interview is for 1 hour, in which the interviewer will talk about his role/experience for 10-15 minutes, ask about your experience for 10-15 minutes and the rest would be a coding question.These interviews were not exceptionally difficult. I felt and had heard that more than cracking every coding questions, at Microsoft, it is more about 1. Being very passionate and excited to join Microsoft 2. Writing clean quality code with comments, main driver function, corner cases, talking as you write and testing the code 3. Presenting yourself professionally.You have the write background if you ve made it on-site. Focus on that background, while continually showing your excitment about being there and wanting to join Microsoft. Have a solid answer to \"Why Microsoft?\" Ask them smart questions which show your thinking ability. Before starting to code on whiteboard, ask clarifying questions about the problem, talk about your design to the problem, point out any limitations. Start coding with proper comments, spaces, use good variable/functions names etc.You will hear back from the recruiter in 1-3 days. Microsoft gives a generous offer, with bonuses and RSUs, benifits, however, if you have a competing offer do negotiate. You will surely get a higher package.",

        "details": "I went through the college recruiting process. Microsoft was among the companies that set up stations at our computer science major recruiting fair where I signed up. The first round was on campus: lasted about 40 minutes, and was easy for a computer science major. About a week later, a recruiter emailed me to tell me that I was being invited for on-site interviews in Redmond (Seattle), WA. The recruiters\u2026\u00a0 are extremely fast and helpful in communicating; interestingly, Microsoft's recruiting process outdoes other companies (Google, FB etc) completely in efficiency and generosity. You're flown out to Redmond and stay in a really comfy hotel with a generous spending budget.Now, it's good to know how on-site interviews work: you begin your day early by meeting with your recruiter, who you should befriend since they are \"on your side\", so to speak, and their input can matter in the decision process. Then, you have consecutive technical interviews lasting about an hour each. You don't have to do perfectly in all of them, but I had a very strong feeling that the first 2 are the most important. The first one is particularly important. If you are doing well, you will get a 4th and sometimes 5th technical interview. If you're lucky, you will afterwards get a final interview with a manager of sometimes, like in my case, a really impressive big boss type person. This big boss can basically hire you on the spot, and its pretty cool that you get to meet someone like this.Don't forget that for Microsoft, as well as other companies, several things matter for college recruiting; your interviews, first and foremost, but also your coursework, projects, grades, internship experiences, etc. Also, knowing more math than average CS majors helps.The next day I found out that I was getting an offer, and the next business day after that my recruiter called me with the details over the phone. Microsoft really, really wants smart new grads. The company and culture has REALLY been improving the past few years, and they want smart new grads to keep that up. Offers are actually more generous than at other competing companies.In my case, you might really like the people you meet or have a personal connection with the big boss type person at the end, in which case your offer could potentially be for the team you actually interviewed with. In this case, you have a choice whether you want to be with that team or go back in the general \"hired\" pool which is distributed into teams at some later point.",

        "details": "I applied online and about three weeks later I received an email from a recruiter. First step was the 30 min phone interview with the recruiter, but since the hiring manager knew about me previously the recruiter did not ask any standard interview questions. I was told about the hiring process and the benefits of working at MS since the hiring manager already knew about me through a referral.Second step\u2026\u00a0 was the interview with the hiring manager. Background, experience, why I wanted to leave my company...the standard stuff. It went well.Third step was the on-site interview. Total of 5 interviews including the \"as-needed\" interview with a director at the end...which I'm told by others means they want to hire you. They asked me about my background, and experience, and about how I handled challenges. Each person left time for me to ask questions. Things were more conversational rather than an interrogation. I felt very relaxed with each person and was riding on a high when I left the campus that afternoon...although I was mentally drained. I had a very good experience up to this point!The reason I gave it a \"neutral\" experience is because I found out that I didn't get the job 4 weeks after my on-site interview. I can understand not getting back to a candidate after the initial phone interview...but after someone has made it to the final on-site interview and then to leave them hanging for nearly a month seems ridiculous. I feel like I should've known within 5 business days that they went with another candidate. Whenever I asked for status from the recruiter, I was given a very generic response. I also know that they prefer internal candidates vs. external.I'm going to try again since it's a great company and I felt a connection to the team and various people I met who work there, but my advice to MS is to please, PLEASE don't leave people hanging. HR was extremely nice though and responded to my emails within 24 hours. I really thought I had that one!.......AND THE SAGA CONTINUES!",

The only thing that's stopping you from doing well is yourself - and I know that that's super cliched, but it's true. Don't let your nerves get in the way, you're going to do fabulous!Some info about me: I'm a sophomore at Stanford, a woman, and a soon-to-be CS major.I applied online\u2026\u00a0 by submitting my resume. After a couple weeks of waiting, I decided to contact my recruiter and ask if he needed any more materials from me. He then scheduled a phone interview about a week later. The questions asked in the phone interview were mostly behavioral - tell me about yourself, why did you get into computer science, what is your favorite software/hardware project, what would you change about it, etc.Then, I was sent an email the next morning telling me that I was invited for final round interviews in January. I was flown up to Seattle in January for a 3-day trip, all expenses paid. I went to a mixer with the recruiters and fellow interviewees on Monday and went back to my free room in the Westin (oh my god). I was assigned to the morning round of interviews and was driven to the Microsoft campus at 8:00 AM. I had three 1-hour interviews with fifteen minute breaks between. I spent the fifteen minute breaks eating free food and playing Halo 4 on the Xbox in the wait room.I was incredibly, incredibly nervous. I had never done a technical interview before. My first interviewer was a super cool guy and I talked to him about my interests, projects on my resume, and etc before he asked me a technical question. My second interviewer and I basically became best friends. I had to design an app, explain what data structures I would use, and code up some algorithms. We spent a lot of time just talking about life and his experiences, however. My third interviewer asked me to implement an ArrayList, which took about 10 minutes to do, before we spent the rest of the time talking and hanging out - talking about Microsoft culture, what to expect as an intern, etc.Honestly, if you can have a conversation with your interviewers and show how much you want to work there, you will be fine. The technical questions are not hard. I came into the interviews unbelievably nervous and came out super relaxed, with the emails of my interviewers in my pocket. They were such incredible people to talk to and the recruiting team was great. 100% couldn't have asked for a better experience for my first interview/recruiting process.I flew back to school the next day. A couple of my friends who had come to interview at Redmond received word back before I did. About a week later I received an email telling me that it had taken a little longer to get back to me because my interviewers have decided to offer me an Software Development Internship rather than an Explore Microsoft one. What a plot twist.Tl;dr: Don't worry. You're going to be fine. Brush up on your coding skills (I used Cracking the Coding Interview), practice your behavioral questions. Let them know how much you want to work there - and enjoy your 3 day stay in Seattle. Even if you don't get the job, you're going to learn so, so much.",

I had 5 total interviews, and had time in 4 of them to ask questions of the interviewer about their team.After the interviews I met with the recruiter again, and explained that I had immediate deadlines.

I had given my resume to them at the career fair a few months before. We decided on a time for a phone screening in the next few days, which went really well as he was great and made it into a\u2026\u00a0 friendly conversation. He then asked me what position I'd be interested in interviewing for (I chose design).A month or so later, I traveled to Boston for my interview. Microsoft paid for everything. The other interviewees and I gathered in a room overlooking the Charles with the two recruiters who were managing our group. Throughout the day food was provided for us in that room, including fruit and desserts. For the designers, we started with a 15-minute panel where we each (individually, in a room separated from the other designers) presented a project we had worked on to three interviewers. They were all really nice and didn't make it stressful at all.Then I had three 45-minute interviews, with short breaks in between (depending on the timing of other interviews). The first I had was with a guy working on the Office team. We talked a bit about my resume, why I wanted to do design (as I'm a CS student), and then he asked me to design the next Microsoft Band (v2, basically). I made good use of the whiteboard, tried to get a sense of the intended user and the current Microsoft Band, and then went off thinking of features that would be useful to them.During the next interview, I talked with the interviewer about the Foundry, talked about working in teams and what I thought of it, and finally he asked me how I would redesign a website or software I know very well. I chose reddit, and talked about making it more visual, not losing the current audience, etc. I felt with this interview even more than the others that the whole conversation was about my thought process without directly asking design questions.The last interview, I think, went best for me because the guy was so upbeat and friendly. I got to talk about some of my experience at hackathons, some more about my resume, and he then asked me to design a microwave for kids. Same process as before; try to figure out the user (and, this time, the customer). I focused a lot on safety and how the child would actually interact with the microwave.In all the interviews, when it came time for me to ask a few questions of my own I would always ask what that interviewer actually did in the company, and went from there. All in all, it was a very positive (though tiring) experience, and everyone was exceptionally friendly.",

Final question about 9 marbles, 1 heavier than all of them, find it using a 2 plate scale.Get an email inviting me to fly out a month later. They set you up with a nice hotel in Bellvue, WA and a rental car (if chosen). Pay for all your meals - an allowance of $75 a day or something in that area. Day\u2026\u00a0 of the interview comes, they pick candidates up together in a party bus infront of the hotel. The bus had flashing strobe lights and neon green lighting at 7am in the morning. It was funny if anything, but quite silly.Throughout the whole thing, I never get told what I was interviewing for. They finally told us and I was COMPLETELY uninterested in the team. That spiked my confidence down. I could've saved MS $2,000+ for my trip if they told me that upfront, I would've declined. Even after talking to all the interviewers, it clearly wasn't for me. So how they got that from my resume I'm not sure.But, that doesn't mean I didn't give it my best shot. Four 45 minute interviews with 5 minute breaks in between for food/drink. The atmosphere was wonderful. It was a great confidence booster. I felt awesome and confident I could nail the position anyway, and after the first interviewer I was told that mobility was a nice perk of the job without even asking! The interviewers started with questions about me, my past projects, strengths/weaknesses, technical questions next, and left maybe a minute or two for questions about them.Technical questions were:-Implement circular array with a k-step elimination-Return sub-array with a maximum continuous sum-Check for a tic-tac-toe winner given a matrix-Without knowing the size of an array, find an element.Strongest interview I think I've ever had. Yet I was told 2 work-days after leaving that they passed on me. I think I fell short on the last interview, with the element in the array, because I didn't realize try-catch was an option to use in a interview. My previous work experience does NOT use try-catch loops, that's a big no-no, they're super slow. I've always used assertions. I got halfway through the question before that and he was unhelpful in pointing out options to solve the problem. He was also a very off-putting interviewer, and didn't seem organized.The other 3 interviewers I had - we laughed, we discussed interesting topics like AI/machine-learning, I nailed the technical questions from start to finish with room for testing and optimization, it was a great time. So my best guess is that last guy talked bad of me, and I was told you need all 4 to basically love you to get in. Waste of time, waste of money on their part.Summary - super easy interviews with laid back atmosphere, great hospitality, but you're left in the dark with what you're interviewing for until the day of and all it takes is 1 interviewer to be stubborn and unreasonable.",

I expected more questions like the type I've posted below, but the two other interviewers asked me exclusively about previous non-tech jobs on my resume which really threw me off.I've worked for a college access program for high-achieving low-income high\u2026\u00a0 school students and one of the interviewers asked me about ways in which the organization could measure its impact. She didn't seem to like that my answers had to do with following and evaluating program graduates' success. At the end of the interview she mentioned that other ways of evaluating its success would be to measure racial and economic diversity growth at colleges as well as leadership positions across various types of careers. I modestly disgreed with her because the organization is exceptional at what it does, but it does it with under 100 students a year. Attributing diversity growth in such broad areas to the organization isn't particularly good at saying anything specific about the organization, whereas following program alumni throughout college and their careers and evaluating their success is more directly related to the organization.The other question was about developing ways to make a small phone/computer repair business that I run better. Wasn't sure exactly what the interviewer was looking for so I talked about expansion, quality assurance, customer guarantees, and developing an app and online presence.",

I'm currently in a PhD program finishing up the masters portion. I casually chatted with a recruiter at a university career fair who told me that he will pass on my resume and that there \"may\" be something for me at Microsoft but he doesn't know what. He\u2026\u00a0 told me to contact the university recruiter in a few days and she might be able to help me better. They called me for a screening interview for an internship the day after.I'm not - what I like to call - \"classically trained\" when it comes to computer science. I prepared for the screening interview by going through the MIT OCW Algorithms and Data Structures course and also reading Miller and Ranum's \"Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures.\" The screening interview went better than expected. Among other things, I was asked to design a parking lot and write code for detecting palindromes.A few weeks later I got a call for a final round interview. It took a while for them to schedule an interview and they gave me a date which was 3 days after a major deadline with my sponsor and so I requested a later date. The scheduler worked with my availability and got me a date that worked. They flew me to Redmond for an interview with the Bing team (I wasn't given that information until the morning of the interview). I was supposed to get 3 to 5 interviews. My first interviewer was late because he missed an email sent by the receptionist. Everything after that went smoothly. I got through all 5 interviews. The third interview was over lunch (we wrote code after, not during). The fifth interview was with a program manager. The questions seemed relatively easy. The topics were: queue design, common ancestor search in a tree with no underlying structure, mixed uni and multi byte character strings, detection of unique addresses, and linked list scanning and element removal. Some interviewers wanted me to just solve a problem as well as I could. Others were looking for a discussion of the problem (one of which was actually very interesting and have the interviewer some new ideas).At the very end I asked the hiring manager some subtle questions about my performance and what kind of competition I was facing. It's nice to be told that there is a \"high probability\" of them making an offer :)",

I made this mistake but\u2026\u00a0 it was apparently minor enough since I got invited for onsite interviews.Flew out to Seattle within 2 weeks of my phone interview. We stayed in the commons and hung out with a large (>40) group of other applicants for various positions--mostly SDE intern. It was pretty neat as we got to ride a party bus to the campus. The waiting room for all the interns was very nice. Large touchscreen TV for fruit ninja, another large surface table for other minigames, catered snacks and drinks.I was an afternoon interviewee so we went to lunch first. The Microsoft lunch area is very nice. We got a $10 voucher for any restaurant type establishment. Everything had a bit of an upscale mall food court feel in a good way. Drinks were also free for all employees, which is cool.I was interviewing for a position in MSIT, which is Microsoft's internal tooling software teams. Things like the enterprise e-commerce division and others. Three technical interviews which were equal parts conversational and coding and one completely conversational job fit. Again my resume topics were discussed quite a bit more than I expected.\u00a0My interviewers were very interested in projects that I had worked on in groups and broad design choices we had made, so if you have any, be ready to speak to them.The interviews went well enough, though I think I choked in the last technical interview. They gradually make your solutions more and more difficult by adding restrictions like runtime and allowed data structures. It got to a point where I simply didn't have an answer, but that might be what they're looking for.2 business days later, I got a call with an offer from my recruiter for an SDE position.

They paid for the flight, a two night stay at the Westin, and for any other expenses like food and taxi travel. When I got there there was a dinner social where you got to meet other candidates and previous explorer interns who now work at Microsoft full time. The next day we were bussed out to the campus and ate lunch in their massive food court and then it was time for the interviews. There are three interviews, one that's more software development oriented, one that's more PM, and one that's more development and testing. The interviews are extremely laid-back. The interviewers are just trying to find out if you are a good fit at Microsoft and you are not competing with the other candidates. If you can just have a conversation with the interviewers, you will be fine. There were three whiteboard coding questions. One was to sort an array of integers. Another was to combine and sort two arrays into a single bigger array. Be sure to have a coding project to talk about, whether it's something you did at a previous internship or a personal coding project. You need to show them that you are extremely interested in technology. I received an email at the end of the same week saying that I got the position.

After the lunch, we went back to the office and there was whiteboard coding questions. This round lasted for about 90 minutes.Interview 2: The interview started with me describing (Sequence Diagram) of my current project. After that I was asked a coding problem and was asked to determine the test cases. This interview lasted for about 60 minutes.Interview 3: A purely testing question followed by some whiteboard coding. This interview too lasted for about 60 minutes. After this interview, the interview told me that my next round of interview would be with the Hiring Manager.Interview 4: Purely behavioral and the hiring manager sees if you are a good fit for the team.Heard back in a week and was extended an offer.Tips: Don't be scared. I was a little overwhelmed when I walked through the campus but then the HR along with other interviewers really ease you into the interview. Talk loudly as the interviewer then knows what you are thinking about. I was given few hints when I was stuck and the hints really help in that case. Also I was really comfortable writing code on the whiteboard as I spent 2 weeks before the onsite interview practicing on the whiteboard. This really helps. A must do!Approach the testing questions in a very structured manner as they really like that.

They will ask for examples of how you've dealt with different situations, including examples of things that did not go well and how you responded. They will ask about strengths and weaknesses. They are usually prepared and in the majority of cases are friendly (and many are as nervous as you are). It's more important to demonstrate how you think than what you actually did. Do your homework and be prepared. After each interview, the interviewer is supposed to post their \"hire\" or \"no hire\" recommendation for the rest of the upcoming interviewers, with comments to explain your rating, as well as instructions for the next interviewer, e.g. \"drill down on the candidate's experience with people development and collaboration skills\". People are inconsistent in this process and so you won't know if the next interviewer did or did not see comments from the prior interview. Assume they did and if there's something you want to clarify that you thought didn't go well, do it. E.g. \"I would like to clarify my comments to the prior interviewer regarding my experience with ABC. In addition to 1, and 2, I also did 3 and 4 which may have more relevance to this role.\" There is always the \"as appropriate\" interview which generally is the GM or VP (depending on the level you're interviewing for) whose valuable time isn't given to candidates that are not likely to make the cut.

Microsoft paid for all of my expenses, and I stayed in the very pleasant Marriott Hotel. I arrived on campus at about 8:30 AM and my first interview was at 10. I spoke with the other interns and some of the staff before my first interview, all were friendly. I had a total of four interviews, one of which was over lunch (the food at their cafeterias is excellent, by the way). All were a lot of fun, and my interviewers chose good questions - ones that could be looked at in many ways, answered in many ways, and expanded on. This made our discussions very interesting. I was extremely tired by the fourth interview, as I had only just arrived at my hotel at midnight the previous night. I got back to the hotel at around 3, and took a nap. My flight didn't leave till close to midnight, so it was a long night getting home...But worth it - I received an offer a week later.Be sure you know your sorting and search algorithms and are knowledgeable about the various properties associated with strings, as well as (non)linear data structures.

Where we ate was giant food court style, all sorts of food available. etc.After lunch, we headed back to the interview building and they told us some logistics of what's next. 1.5 days later, I got an email asking when I'll be available to \"chat\" and the next day, my recruiter called and said I got the position.One thing I want to say is that, Redmond + Bellevue is dominated by Microsoft buildings and it seems that you get a lot of respect if you are an Microsoft employee.

He then asked me how to improve the algorithm, I did not come up with a good alternative algorithm, so I told him I can implement the recursion in a distributed fashion. The pro is scalability, and the con is extra cost on machines. At last, he ask me to say something about testing - how to possibly test the class I just wrote.

As I handed in my resume I was asked questions about my experience and interests. A few days later I got an e-mail invitation from a Microsoft HR contractor\u2026\u00a0 to do a sit-down interview. The interview happened a couple of weeks later, also on campus, with a Microsoft engineer.The interviewer was cordial but curt because interviews were 30 minutes and stacked back-to-back all day, with no time cushion between. The interviewers were mostly casually dressed as were the applicants.My interviewer asked me about my background and experience, then gave me a coding question. All other applicants I talked to were also given a coding problem, not one of those mythical non-tech brain teasers I have read about companies such as Google giving.I was applying for their no-experience-needed \"explorers\" internship. I told the interviewer I just started learning about arrays, so he asked me to code an array sorting function. He seemed surprised it was over my head, in spite of it being my first month in intro to C, which Microsoft knew in advance.I wasn't able to completely code the answer, but the interviewer was helpful, offering general advice on how to complete it. I got a generic rejection e-mail about three weeks later from a do-not-reply address, saying my resume would be kept on file for a year.This year I got an e-mail from Microsoft again, saying an engineer had reviewed my resume on file from last year and wanted us to do a sit-down interview. It was about the same as last year, though Microsoft was not offering the \"explorer\" internship anymore, just the need-experience one. My interviewer again was cordial, even friendly, and asked me similar questions to last year, followed by a new coding question that I was given a Surface tablet with an IDE (no compiler) to code with.I handled it better this year, but I couldn\u2019t finish the code so I talked it out. He asked how to code a translator from a base-10 number system to another system. I had about 15 minutes to code it, with the interviewer at times looking at my screen and notes, and asking questions. He was being helpful but it was too much pressure for me. The interview ended with some advice on how to handle the problem and well-wishes.I got basically the same rejection e-mail from them as I did last year.Microsoft has an efficiently structured system for recruiting applicants, processing applications (through web and e-mail) and coordinating interviews. They even use an automated system to remind you of your interview after you select it through a web system. The only weakness is a mismatch between the stated job requirements and what the interviewers expect you to know. In the case of last year's interview, for example, I had to explain what the explorer internship I was applying for was because the interviewer had never heard of it, and seemingly was not prepared to ask questions on that level.",

I told him that I didn't even remember the question, it had been so long. I'm sure it would have been better if I mentioned having\u2026\u00a0"

I was given about a months time between the phone interview\u2026\u00a0 and my on-site.Depending on your process, you will either be going to Microsoft Building 111's recruitment event where you are cycled through 4 interviewers between you and 10 - 20 other candidates, or meeting with a recruiter and then going to another building to interview where you will have 3 - 5 interviews, including a lunch interview.This time I was selected to interview with 3 - 5 people in the Office team. You are not given your team beforehand. The team you are interviewing with may also not be the team you end up working with.The problems are algorithmic in nature and you are expected to test and clarify requirements. Each interview is about an hour long and between each interview you will be taking a break while the interviews discuss among each other about how you did.From what I have understood each interviewer has a hire/no hire decision. If you receive 2 no hires out of your first 3 interviews, your day may be cut short. When you reach the 5th interview, (s)he is the hiring manager and ultimately has veto power.For me it was a rather discouraging experience. I made it to the 5th interview. I felt I performed very well, giving them optimal solutions, and struggling with only 1 and a half of the 6 problems I was asked, but ended up solving them optimally in the end. However, I received the discouraging call later that week that I would not be hired. It didn't make sense to me and I tried to reflect on how I could have done poorly being very familiar with technical interviews at this stage. I felt that what I had to nitpick with myself what I performed weakly on. The most discouraging part is how they will not tell you anything aside from apply back next year. At this stage I'm not even sure how to improve since I do not think I am technically lacking and I did not believe I came off rude or obnoxious during the interview. Just my luck.",

I've interviewed and hired many people over the years. I hope this information helps. :)Expect one or more standard phone screens\u2026\u00a0 followed by an invitation for on-site interviews. I don't know much about the phone screen process since I was a product group manager and not part of the initial recruiting. In my experience, the best way to prepare for a Microsoft interview is as follows:1. Create a table with the elements of the job description in one column, your level of competence with that requirement in the second column, and a specific example of when you applied that skill in the third. Have one row for each requirement, each responsibility, and for any other qualities mentioned in the job description.2. Write a two or three sentence answer to the question: Why do you want to work at Microsoft?3. Be clear about what you have learned. Where have you failed? What did you learn from that and how did you apply that knowledge to a subsequent situation?4. Write two to three sentences about what your unique contribution has been to each position you've held. This is referred to as your \"super power.\" Are you the person who finds flaws in the plan? Are you the person who has big ideas? Are you the one person who's not afraid to disagree? Find your thing and lead with it.Microsoft wants its employees to be self-critical and willing to grow. You will need those skills in order to succeed as much as you need technical or professional skills.I've seen other posts with more details about the process, so I won't repeat them. Just be honest about yourself. You don't need to dredge up and reveal the worst things about yourself, but you should be willing to expose who you really are, where you need and want to grow, and what your unique contribution to the company or group might be.",

After we found a date, I was told it would be a full-day of interviewing. I was also told to bring a portfolio presentation to showcase my work (about 3-5 pieces) that would take about an hour.The interview day came and I met with the recruiter. He gave me a sheet of my interview schedule (2 presentations with a panel, and 4 one-on-ones). He mentioned that after the first 2 presentations the group would get a general understanding of how the interview is going, and at this point some people are asked to leave. Each interview is a gatekeeper to the next step.The first presentation was easy, it was mostly with other designers on various teams that I would be interacting with. People asked questions about the work, why I went with this direction, what my design tools are, etc.The second presentation was much harder, it was with all of the team managers and I was to present my design exercise. As I walked the group through my process they would ask questions and I was to elaborate for a design decision I made. As I presented my last slide they then proceeded to ask \"what if...\" questions that were really rough. They would change the scope or ask to think of doing something completely different. It's more of a task to see how well you respond to criticism and how fast you can think on your feet. They gladly pointed me to the whiteboard and I drew various scenarios with what I would do. It was very challenging as I would finish with one scenario someone asked, someone else would as \"but what if you wanted to do...\" and you would go through that process.After the second, long, interview I was to have lunch with another manager. As we walked and ate lunch, I went over what I was passionate about, what I thought about MS, where I saw the future going with technology, etc. The manager then went over the MS philosophy and what products I would be working on, and was mostly a \"personality fit\" interview. After that I had another interview with another manager who would give me another design exercise that I was to solve in an hour. This one was harder as the details were very vague and I had to ask a lot of questions. After that, I had another interview with another manager where they were open to any questions I wanted to ask and was more of a \"you've done a great job so far, now you're meeting with the division director\". This last one was one of the hardest as I presented my portfolio and design exercise to the director of the entire division. He sat mostly silent, no expressions given, and asked few questions. Afterwards, he shook my hand and said \"you did good\" and walked me out.I was now done. I had no idea how well it went, but I figured it went well enough to interview with the director. The recruiter called me the next to day to see how I was feeling about the position and how the rest of the interview went. He mentioned that after the group decides whether they would give me an offer, it would be about 3-5 days before I heard from them. 2 days later I got a call from the recruiter saying that they would like to give me an offer. He explained all of the initial benefits of MS and how compensation would work. I told him that I would gladly accept and began offer process (which took about a week long).",

        "details": "I attended a conference and noted down the presenter's email id as I was really impressed with the work they were doing. When looking for full time, I contacted the person for any openings in their team. Fortunately, I heard back from them and got a phone screen schedule within one week.Phone Screen was easy and mainly focused on the projects i wrote in my resume and some algorithmic problems\u2026\u00a0 related with those projects.Within one week, I heard back from them that I was through first round and need to come to Seattle for face to face interview. They were really helpful in scheduling the interview according to my convenience.Microsoft takes care of their their employees and potential employees as well in my case. Wonderful and systematic scheduling. I landed in Seattle.Whole day was set aside for interviews, I had 5 in total including the famous 5th interview which is a positive sign as mentioned by many here. First interview, little variation on the level order traversal which i was able to code it with some help from the recruiter who was really nice. You will have to write the code on board so I would suggest do some \"Actual\" coding preferably on some IDE which shows only syntactical errors and runs the program. Eclipse is sometimes too helpful which let's us forget minor mistakes.Second round was a real life project problem related with quick ip lookup, for which I have default solution, Tries. I told each and every pros and cons of using tries and the interviewer was satisfied. I stumbled a little while implementing it but eventually was able to do that with of course the help of interviewer.Oh yeah one more thing each interview is approximately 45 mins to 60 mins long and lunch time discussion is also part of the recruiting process. So don't lose your head thinking that it's not part of the process.3rd interview which included the lunch discussion as i mentioned above. I was not aware of it but since interviewer only discussed my projects on resume, i was happy to talk about them. But was really thinking why the lunch is so much work. Later i realised when interviewer said, let's go back to the office and continue the discussion. This was the toughest round as interviewer went in to very specific details about my projects so one tip do remember some of the tools names, just to name drop them ;)4th round was a short one as the 3rd one went for one and half hours. This one was comparatively lighter and mainly focused on design problems.Then came, the nerve wrecking wait as they told me to wait so that they all can discuss how i performed and decide on the last interview with the 2nd line manager. Thankfully manager came soon and ask me to wait for 2nd line manager. That discussion was very informal sort as he was selling me Microsoft and why I should come and work there. Happy sign always ! :)Then I came back to my awesome hotel as I had my flight back same day in the evening.Almost next day itself the HR contacted me and I missed her call. I really thought I did'nt get through but thankfully Hr called me back next day and told me I am through !!Only advice I can give you is \"CODE\" ! there is no way around it! If you want to work as SDE you need to know Algorithms and Data Structures ! Language is no issue but you must know how to implement it. At least able to discuss why to us and why not to use a particular data structure.",

He asked me two questions: 1) What is the biggest technical challenge that you are proud of overcoming? 2) How many elevators do you need for a building (after asking some questions, the building is 40 floors - first 10 floors are retail, the next 20 are corporate, and the top\u2026\u00a0 10 are residential)? 4 weeks later, I finally heard from an interview scheduler that I've made it to the final round interview in Redmond, WA. I had a pending offer so they worked with me to get up there as quickly as possible. They covered everything including airfare, rental car, food, and lodging so that was nice. On interview day, I first spoke with my recruiter for less than 10 minutes. I was rushed to the Bellevue office because of the time it took to get there. I ended up hanging in the waiting room for 30 minutes before I was called. The first interviewer asked me a few questions about my resume and then two technical-ish questions. First one was how would I improve the elevator and the second was to write a program to find the area of the intersection of two rectangles. I didn't have any breaks in between any of my interviews. The second interviewer asked me detailed questions about a project on my resume. He then gave me a scenario with a manager, a dev team, and a customer group. The manager wants me, the PM, to increase revenue by $1mil however way I can. The customer wants to increase by $2mil but they will provide resources. The dev team says that they can do $1mil but it won't be immediate. How do you handle the situation? I guess the main point was to notice that the $2mil is actually not better than $1mil because they will be providing more workers than the dev team would've. I didn't make that realization so that probably is where I lost the position. The next interviewer was late by about 15 min (so I guess I did get some break). We ate lunch and just talked about what I like about Bing and what I don't like and random stuff like what I do for fun. We then went back to his office and talked about things on my resume. He then asked me how I would improve the elevator there. They seem to really like questions about elevators. He then told me that I was done for the day and could head back to the recruiting building. I knew at that point I didn't get it since I only got 3 interviews. They got back to me the next day via email that I didn't get it. Overall, it was a good experience and I hope to try again for full-time in the future.",

Was flown in for an overnight stay and went through 4 interviews the next day.The first one was easy, a few operations on linked lists, although the interviewer did not seem excited or happy to be doing the interview, seemed like he just drew a short straw.The second was worse, the interviewer seemed to have a large ego and felt the need to correct everything I said (including things like why I like programming and what my favorite project was), I just attempted to remain polite. He asked me about finding the largest consecutive sum in an array. Although I managed to put something together, I do not feel it was what he was looking for and he showed me his solution which I questioned and never got a satisfactory answer for (I was afraid to push him further because we were short on time and he seemed very firm in his ideas and I was far too nervous and tired). I don't feel he fully understood the question he asked me himself and that he just chose it from a list.The next interviewer I had lunch with, then a few more questions such as iterative and recursive fibonacci, approaching new code, etc. He also had a piece of paper and seemed to be choosing questions from a list. He was young and personable although he seemed very tired and beaten down.My final interview seemed to be with a higher-up manager, he was older and seemed to have more influence over Windows 8 features (he was able to point to some of the decisions he had made on the tablet interface). He was very laid back and didn't really ask anything specific. Rather, he simply asked what I liked, then discussed it, asked for some code examples.

My first interview was half fit and half marketing case (e.g, \"we're having problem X, walk me through\u2026\u00a0 the strategic marketing approach you would take\"). The second was a a series of fit questions and one brain teaser; I found the latter difficult and did not ace it, but must have had strong reviews from my other interviewers since I ultimately received an offer. My third interviewer asked questions to gauge what I would call \"business maturity\" (e.g, \"If you were working on a team and there was a disagreement on X, how would your respond?\"). My fourth and final interviewer dug deeper on topics that came up in my other interviews and it seemed as though he was trying to gauge where I should be placed. This made me think that I had already received a \"Hire\" decision, and turns out that was the case. I later learned that this is typical: if you're a Hire, the last interview is usually with a senior person to determine where within the company you would be a good fit.

Both were situational, behavioral, no real technical questions just tell me about your work experience and what about Microsoft/this role attracts you/why are you leaving\u2026\u00a0 your current company.The loop was a bit different. The first interview was with the most junior member of the team which was the most technical. He wanted to know if I'd done my homework about himself and the team (luckily I looked them up in linkedin beforehand). His first question was \"what do you know about me?\". And then some additional technical questions about the role . He was friendly and gave feedback when I asked for it.I went to lunch with the hiring manager. She told me it was more a technicality because she had already gotten a good feel for me over our phone conversation, but she still wove in situational questions over the meal. It was slightly awkward to eat and talk - so I didn't end up eating very much but it was a long day so keep this in mind.The rest of the interviews seemed like technicalities. People were friendly and asked about my resume, why msft, only one of them in a different building was slightly stressful. This person kept firing questions at me one after the other - things like \"what are your strengths/weaknesses\", \"tell me about a difficult manager you had\", \"tell me about a project you worked on where you had to gain buy in from and engage different parties\" and he didn't allow me to ask questions.Overall I liked the process. I liked the fact that I was able to meet the full team I'd be working with. I got a feel for the young fun culture of the company and also how hard working everyone is. The final interview with the head of the team was more informational. She was selling me on why I should choose Microsoft and trying to prepare me for a higher workload in her group and to make me fully aware of the limited scope of the role. I found her friendly however, approachable and real. She did 90% of the talking.It helped me to have other interviews lined up in the pipeline with other competitors. Also having offers, even from lesser companies. In the end I told Microsoft if their offer was competitive enough I wouldn't interview with Amazon and they came in very competitive.",

The first hour, I was interviewed by two engineers. They asked various technical questions and then asked me about a technology that I felt pretty comfortable with. At that point they probed to see how well I knew that technology. They did this until I started saying \"I don't know\" and then they would move to something else.What I really liked about the interview is that I felt like they had a good idea of what I brought to the table and what I did not bring to the table by the end of the interviews. I like that because I know that if they hire me, they already know some of my strengths and weaknesses.",

        "details": "Applied online and after a month or so heard back and was invited to attend a back to back interview on campus, one with a recruiter, one with an engineer. Both were really pleasant, the engineering interview was a simple programming task done on a laptop: write a function which given a string will return if it contains correctly matched open and closed parentheses. Expanded to include other types of\u2026\u00a0 brackets and return if all were correctly matched.I heard back very quickly informing me I had made it through to the final round on site assessment day. Couldn't make the first couple of interview dates offered so was eventually invited to travel to Redmond for an interview day at the main offices. Organizing travel was very easy and everyone involved was incredibly helpful.On the day, arrived at building 111 for mid morning. Was guided around campus and taken to the commons for a free lunch. We visited the visitors center and the company store and were invited to buy up to $120 of discount merch.We then returned to 111 for the interviews. We were each allocated a division we'd be interviewing for (this was not shared before the first interview). We were each interviewed by four interviewers who asked a variety of question covering fundamentals of computer science and some advanced material. We had a ten minute gap between each interview in which the examiners compared notes before we were launched into the next one.Asked technical questions on a number of topics, sorting algorithms and their time and space complexities, binary trees and binary search trees, low level computer scheduling and atomicity of operations, and an abstract data type question. I've provided examples of a small number of questions below.These were mixed in among other behavioral questions, attitudes, what do you do for fun, what's important when implementing software, how to interact with team members etc.It was generally very broad with lots of interesting questions; I wouldn't say especially hard but thats all relative... If you know the field and are well prepared you shouldn't find anything too tough...Don't worry about making mistakes, I know I sure made a couple, the key is checking back over your solutions as you go, work with test cases and when you identify a shortcoming, work out how you can fix it. TALK OUT LOUD! They don't care if you get stuck in a circle as long as they can see your thought process and why it's happening. If you've overlooked something they will happily drop a hint and see if you can rectify.My biggest tip would be friendly and relaxed, make it more of a conversation than a rigid interview. I almost got the feeling they were more interested in my personality than what I wrote on the board, so make it easy for them to like you: At the end of the day the big question they're asking themselves is, 'would I like to work alongside this person', not just 'can he do the work'.Overall, my interview was incredibly positive, everyone was super friendly and did their best to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. The company was very generous with arranging travel, accommodation etc and first and foremost Microsoft seemed an incredible place to work. Go for it, give it your best shot, what is there to lose?",

On the day of your interview take full advantage of your recruiters by asking about the company, background of engineers working there and what they expect out of their potential hires, although you may know a lot about the company from online sources, I would recommend asking the recruiters these questions as you will\u2026\u00a0 get a clear idea.Focus on a lot of functional test cases first especially when they ask you to test the code you write, dont worry about where it is used and which application makes use of this code as you may waste time in clarifying and get lost in thoughts, as the interviewer would say, I just need functional test cases.But remeber when they ask you to test a application or some real world about then think in a methodical fashion like Test environment, Use Cases, Functional Tests, Special Test cases like Globalization tests, integration etc.Make sure you understand the question. Some times they may not give all the details in the question they ask, they want to see how you get the most information out of them. Dont proceed without understanding the question! and also make confirm whether you are allowed to use additional data structures or helper functions.You may have read that you have to think aloud when you write a program, if it works for you great follow that. For some people like me, I usually get lost in thoughts if I do that, so what I did was I told the interviewer I will take 5 mins to analyse the problem and come up with the solution and I will explain it step by step. If you get stuck just dont stare at the board, tell the interviewer your logic and where you are getting stuck, as they may give you hints which are very helpful.First round is usually is easy, they want you to get comfortable, so dont ignore programs like fibonacci, common factor, which are very basic problems. As the rounds progresses it becomes harder.Your energy levels and the thinking speed drops as you cruise through the day. Make sure you have practice working on problems for long time period(). For this just like a week before, try to setup a mock interviews with yours friends stretched out for a day packed with five 45 minutes interview with 15 min break or if your friends are busy ask your friend to randomly pick problems write them into a piece of paper and place them into 5 different files. Try to work on them the whole day. Trust me this will definitely help you. On the day before the interview please please relax and get a lot of sleep dont try to read something you dont know cause it messes up things which you know and drops your confidence levels.Focus on String manipulation, Lists, Tree traversals, very very important topics for a microsoft interview. Learn from the mistakes other people did, trust me it will make you better a programmer. Good Luck fellow programmers!!!!",

All the interviewers had >15 years experience at Microsoft.1st interview:* we talked about my CV, past projects, current projects (What difficulties I had, Why I took some of the decisions, etc)* design question - design a parking lot* why I would like to work at Microsoft* I had the chance to ask questions2nd interview:* I had to explain something in technology that excites me. I chose a product and then I was asked follow up questions, such as: \"What difficulties do you think they had when developing it?\", \"What's good for the user? What's bad for the user?\"* I presented a previous project in details (even including prototypes on the white board). I pitched it in the beginning and then dived into details (I had 20 min time for it, so be sure you know the projects in the CV in detail!)* again, I asked questions at the end3rd interview:* most difficult one* I had to present one of my project in detail - again on the blackboard* then, I had to present another project in 90 seconds (the interviewer told me to talk about my project, I asked what's the time limit, and he said 90 seconds - so in the end I gave kind of elevator pitch)* a question about elevators: \"A CEO complains that the elevator in his building sucks - what would I do?\" - I couldn't talk with the CEO to find out what's wrong, everything was normal, the other people weren't complaining. I was focused more on customer interviews to find out what was wrong, in the end I had to test it. I could not figure the question myself, so the interviewer gave me a hint (I had to think about my phone and its parameters and why I chose it)* then, I Had to think about 5 things I would improve in the elevators in that building (without knowing what the problem was) and then chose the two most important (HINT: Prioritize the list in the beginning, then it's much easier to cut off)* again, I asked questions4th interview:* more technical, I had to explain the architecture of a software project in detail* questions to the interviewer againTips:* be prepared with a \"framework\" for the design questions: firstly, you have to ask questions (about customer, business context, technology, etc). Then, design & implementation* be prepared for asking questions at the end of each interview* know each of your project in detail (challenges, technical details, situations, learnings, etc)* when you present a project, be sure to pitch it right and to present it nicely (they are not interested about the project, but about how you can present it, what was your role in it, what you learned, etc)Good luck!",

You could ask your interviewer what they do in the company, what a day in the workplace would be like, etc. The questions themselves would also vary depending on which track your interviewer is from.

Meeting went very well and was very conversational in nature\u2026.no hard questions. I sent follow up letter. A few\u2026\u00a0 days later I was contacted by the hiring manager was asked to meet informally with the GM as well. A few weeks later I met with the GM. That meeting went very well and again was very conversational with no hard questions. The GM said at this point they want to formally place me through the \"interview loop\" to see how I would do.Phase 3 the Interview Loop.First Interview: It was a Lync conference call. I was scheduled to attend the meeting from a building on the Redmond Main campus. I arrived 15 minutes early so I could get in the building etc. No Microsoft HR contact was at the building to meet me to take me to the conference room. I was able to convince the lobby attendant to take me to the reserved conference room and call the hiring manager to let him know. The meeting started on time and the person interviewing me seemed to disagree with everything I said and constantly changed up the questions. I felt like she was being confrontational on purpose to see how I handle stress. After 15 minutes of this confrontational interview she finally seemed to get very likable. Interview ended 15 minutes early (I thought this was not a good sign).Second Interview: I had to go to a different building for another conference call. Again no contact was at the building to meet me. This time no luck in talking my way into the conference room. The building admin called the hiring manager and someone came down to escort me to the conference room for my second Lync interview. Interview went well but again interview ended 15 minutes early.Third interview: was in person (finally). This was a peer interview. It was very conversational in nature talking about the product lines, Microsoft products, working culture of Microsoft, competitors etc. No real hard questions. My schedule only had 3 interviews on it\u2026which is typical as that way if the vote is \u201cno\u201d by interview three they can say good bye.Fourth Interview: with the hiring manager who I had met informally with weeks prior. This was a tough interview this time. Lots of really deep probing questions on how I would approach the position, deep dive into my skill sets with examples and scenario questions. By the end of this interview it was now close to 6pm and it was close to 2 hours for this interview. I was getting a bit tired. But I dug deep down and found the energy reserves as I know all about getting the last \u201cas appropriate\u201d interview. At 6pm the hiring manager asked me if I had time to meet with the GM again who I had met informally with a few weeks before). Yes! I was \u201cin\u201d.Fifth Interview: 6pm....The \"as Appropriate\" Interview. This interview was really great and just conversational in nature and at that point the GM said the whole team really liked me and I would definitely be getting an offer. The GM took a full hour to talk with me from 6pm to 7pm. I really appreciated this as he was not rushing the interview just to go home. At 7pm the GM walks me to the hiring manager and says I am going to walk out with (me) and we chatted another 15 minutes out in front of the buildingAfter 2 days I received an offer. Counter offered 1 time and was very happy.",

This interview lasted about 30 minutes and consisted of behavior questions and a few technical/critical thinking questions. Overall, the interviewer was very nice and helpful throughout the questions which made the interview go well. Since the holiday season was very close to my phone interview date, I had\u2026\u00a0 to wait a little longer to get results, at least that's what they said. During the second week in January, I received an email congratulating and saying that I will move onto the final round of interviews. I was then informed that I would be going out to Redmond in a week later for the on-site interviews.With just a little bit of information from me, they were able to book the trip for me and I did not have much to do. Once in Redmond for the interviews, we met with our recruiters and they introduced themselves to us. We were then taken by a concierge to The Commons to eat lunch around 11:30. He also showed us a little bit of the campus. After eating lunch, we were guided to explore a little more before we went to the Company Store. We had to be back to the first building by 1 for the start of interviews. Once back, individual people came out to get us for a 1 on 1 interview. Each interview was about 45 minutes with 15 minute breaks in-between where you can play Xbox, use a Surface, snack, or relax on the couch. Half way through, we got a longer break to relax or do whatever.After all of the interviews concluded, we were told that we would be notified within the next week if we were offered a position.They pay for your meals and fun activities too!

Some of the other people interviewing received nearly all design questions while others had mostly coding/algorithm questions. I had a mix of design and coding questions which were done on the whiteboard.For all of the coding/algorithm questions time and space requirements were discussed as the approach was talked through. No specific requirements were given at the start of a question, but the resulting complexities had to be discussed and justified. Some questions related to balancing the time and space requirements. Test cases were also discussed for each question ranging from use cases to catching integer overflow.The final design question was very open ended, which I think actually tripped me up a bit because after several focused technical questions, I had trouble thinking from a broad design point of view.Overall, I felt the interviews all went well, but with no feedback from the interviewers I can't say what it was that kept me from getting an offer.",

        "details": "I had dropped my resume at the university career fair and got a call for an on-campus interview a couple of weeks later. It was an easy one with one technical question (Perform a level-wise traversal in a binary tree) and a few HR questions. Another couple of weeks later I got a call for the on-site interview for SDET position.I have to say Microsoft really pampers the candidates and\u2026\u00a0 gives a very good first impression. I was flown to Redmond and put up in Westin. Limos were arranged to pick me up from the airport to hotel and from hotel to/from Microsoft campus. It was a day long affair with 4 back to back interviews and the recruiters made sure that the time between the interviews was relaxing and helped a great deal to reduce the stress of an interview.Interview 1A small coding problem which wasn't really difficult. I was then asked to test a parking garage. Make sure that you cover all possible scenarios and test cases. I was pretty satisfied at the end of this interview.Interview 2This was a young enthusiastic guy but it turned out to be the worst interview for me of the day. We started with test cases for some function, and it went pretty well. Then he asked me to come up with a method to find anagrams in a dictionary and then kept making the requirements and scenario more complex after each proposed solution. I came very close to the optimal solution, but even then I felt I took too much time in doing so. His feedback was that I should be asking more for the problem details instead of concentrating directly on solving it. It was a good point to remember but at the end of the interview I felt I could have done way way better and was a bit disappointed.Interview 3This interview in fact began while we were walking from the conference room to the interviewer's office. We talked about my interests, why Microsoft etc etc. And then came the most stressful part. He asked me how I would test a toaster that is supposed to toast bread in outer space. Interesting problem, and thanks to the feedback from the 2nd interview I spent a great deal of time clarifying the conditions in which it would be used, who will use it etc etc. I must have come up with at least around 30-40 cases, but he kept staring at me as if I was missing out something obvious. I guess he wanted to test if I could think under pressure. This went on for about 20-30 minutes. We ended up with a small coding exercise and I was happy with my performance.Interview 4I was quite tired by this time and I think it showed. The interviewer had been there for 13 years and he was very comforting. He then asked me to test a particular function. We went over many test cases and once we were done, he told me to write the code for it. This was fun because I had to ensure that my code passes all the test cases that I have come up with myself. He helped me a bit along the way and it went smoothly.We, the candidates were then taken for lunch and then were free to roam around the campus. Happened to see Steve Balmer too (he was busy on his phone). I returned back to the hotel and slept the whole evening. My flight was the next day morning and they had given me taxi voucher's to cover the fare.Got the offer the following week. I was a bit apprehensive since I felt my 2nd interview may screw up my chances, but I guess it did not. I accepted it and now I am totally looking forward to joining them.",

They gave us a tour of the campus and took us to the store.

A lot of distributed network questions were asked. It is good to have an all-rounded preparation. Don't just concentrate on Data structures and OOPS. Some of the questions were:\"How would you design the swimming pool for a resort in Mexico?\"\"What data structure would you use for a website like Ancestry.com and how and why.\" Had to write code for this\"You have a website that displays the stock prices of every company everyday with trends.

Once there, I was placed\u2026\u00a0 in an interview group of ~20 other candidates. One thing that was strange about our experience was that instead of the typical variable number of interviews, we were all given 4 (and told that we would be). They also guaranteed us results after lunch, which was both a relief and extra stressful.Interview one: we chatted for a while and then talked through a problem regarding system updates and server communication (the keys to this one were asking questions that made clear what each party knew and also understanding the priorities of the different updates).Interview two: My worst interview. Talked about solving Seattle's traffic problems (a \"see how you think\" kind of problem) and then had a shortest-path algorithm variant. I picked a poor approach for the latter but corrected myself with a simpler and cleaner answer before the interview was over.Interview three: Write an algorithm to solve a NYT-style cryptogram (actually I have no idea if these are real or not--I have never heard of them). Then, design an app. Then, make money off of it (ads don't count). A really fun interview, as he and I kept building off each other's ideas.Interview four: Design a parking lot system (with some additional specifications). The keys were A) to not overcomplicate things, as the users crave simplicity, not technology, and B) to recognize that ultimately the system isn't worth implementing from management's standpoint, since the improvements wouldn't affect productivity.We went to lunch, and then came back to learn our fates!",

I was hoping to not get a super technical one (since I was interesting in Ux, but I did, it was still really interesting tho). He asked me a basic design question. Then I went on to my second person. It was a bit odd because they had me wait outside the office while they both spoke about me ( I got kicked out of a common area once since a guy wanted to have a meeting there, was odd) . All the interviews were about the same, just design questions, no coding questions. I went through 5 interviews (including the as appropriate) but unfortunately it did not work out for me. I would suggests that when they ask you design questions, of course ask them questions to clarify but don't be afraid to just jump right in a design and ask clarification questions mid way through. I asked too many questions from the start that there were times I was unable to go through the full design process. Also, think out loud but if your mind wanders a bit from use case to use case when you design things, filter your thinking a bit. I always get to a good design but sometimes my thinking process is a bit scattered so be sure to think out loud, but beware of sounding scatter brained!",

Ironically, the position was offered to a male, who eventually turned the position down.

When I gave my Resume to one of their representative (current Engineer at Microsoft), he quickly asked few questions to get to know about my background. Later he told me that he would forward this to one of the recruiter and he will contact me if there is a suitable match. I had to raise my eyebrow here, cause the guy has my Resume\u2026\u00a0 and he asked me several questions. This alone should be enough to proceed ahead with interview or no interview. Reading other posts, it seems MS conducts onsite campus interviews, then why forward to recruiter. Perhaps, due to lower reputation of my university, they do not want to spend too much time interviewing people onsite.A couple of weeks later, I got an email to schedule a phone interview. At last, something is better than nothing as I get about half an hour to prove my capacity. I have gone through interview posts here on Glassdoor and I could not find any details on phone interviews. Most were either college interviews or people talking about their onsite interviews after passing phone interview. In any case, I prepared myself with the questions posted and later on I realized those were overkill for the phone interview.Now, I have gone through plenty of phone interviews with multiple tech giants. In most cases, I have made it to later rounds in phone interview, but no onsite though. Well, I just want to say I have become quite comfortable with these initial interviews, both technically and behaviorally.The interviewer called on time and we started with discussing my background. This was already done when I submitted my Resume, so I see no point in reiterating all this. Although, I was asked similar questions in my past interviews, but on those occasions, I did not forward my Resume personally and the initial phone calls were the first time when I spoke to someone inside the company.Next I was asked several semi-technical and behavioral questions. Most of these questions are already discussed elsewhere, therefore I will not emphasize much on those. However, I will mention some of them below, cause I think it's on these questions I may have under performed. As for other questions, I am sure \"Design a Table\", \"Test an Elevator\" and \"Determining Apple, Orange and Apple-Orange from incorrectly labelled boxes\" should ring a bell or you will certainly encounter them if you search on internet.Few days later, I got the usual no offer email. The only positive thing I can take is they told me to reapply in 6 months. From what I know, they usually give a 1 year clause, therefore this was a good rejection, I hope.I did give some ridiculous answers which could be a good reason for rejection.

I\u2026\u00a0 hadn't thought about any of these things and I was mostly doing the interview to get practice, which the interviewer picked up on immediately. Within the first ten minutes he asked me \"do you really want this internship?\", I was honest and the dynamic of the interview changed to him giving me helpful feedback after my crappy flustered answers. Anyway, the behavioral questions were tough (for me since I didn't prepare): what makes you better at coding then the other 15 people I am about to interview, why do you think you are qualified for this job, what is your style of writing code, why should I hire you. The technical part began with him asking me to write a function that returns the number of coins to make change for a given input value. It was very ambiguous so I asked a bunch of questions and easily got a whole lot more information. I was able to write a function that worked, making it the only section I hadn't bombed yet. I was then asked to test out a function that was supposed to do the same thing (number of coins) and figure out what was wrong with it. I was only given 5 inputs that I wasted stupidly by not putting in a currency. Needless to say I didn't do well but overall the interview was a good experience because I received a lot of helpful feedback. The interviewer was very nice and even kept me a few minutes past when the interview was over because he wanted to help me for future interviews.

It's an automated tool and\u2026\u00a0 each interview casts their vote right after your interview and then enters in comments regarding whether you are a 'Hire' or 'No Hire'. The majority of interviewers have to mark you as a 'Hire' in order for you to interview with the last person. This last person is called the 'As Appropriate' interviewer. In the Program Management discipline, an 'As Appropriate' interviewer is typically the unit head, potentially a Principal level Program Manager or Group Program Manager (GPM).

They basically interview you for these two roles, then decide with which one to go.I've been contacted by a recruiter in September for an on-campus interview. I told her I was traveling, so she'd get back to me for a phone screen. 5 weeks passed, I had not received any invitation for a phone call even though we\u2026\u00a0 had been emailing every week. Then I reached out to another recruiter, this time I was directed to a scheduler, and was able to have a phone interview scheduled.The phone interview went well, I was invited on site. All the candidates were gathered together at a pre-interview dinner. There were a lot of MACH hires there, most of them were nice, although some of them were really cocky. They were like - \"oh no, I don't allow any Apple products around me\", or \"anything that begins with an i- can't be around\". So I recommend you don't use your phone if it's an iPhone etc. Wear business casual.The next day was our interview day. Although it was stated that we were supposed to wear business casual, all of the candidates were suited up! Yup, bring your suits... After spending almost an hour talking to people, they started calling our names. I had four back to back interviews. All of them were working in the Services division. They are actually interviewing you for both Associate Consultant and Technical Account Manager roles.Generally, the interviewers were cool. However, these guys really dislike anything related to Apple or Google. I had an offer from Google, and I was interviewing with Microsoft just for the experience... All four interviewers asked about the offer. Like \"Why Google?\", \"Which position?\", \"Why would you choose Microsoft over Google, or vice versa\" etc. Some of the questions were technical; troubleshooting, TCP/IP, networking, Windows Server, layers etc. I don't know why they even ask networking questions to a person who's not going to be a Professional Support Technician.My only advice would be, don't tell them about your offers. Otherwise, the whole interview focuses on your offer rather than your background, skills and what you want to do.",

No need to fake anything. Be honest. Say you don't know to things you don't know or can't remember on the spot. Ask questions. Be social. The people you speak to are going to be your peers and mentors so they need to feel a sense of comfort with you too. You need to show your willingness to learn and being open to their ideas and suggestions.Don't make the mistake that I made -- stayed up for 26 hours before catching 3 hours of sleep and then going into the interview. By the end of the day, you are so numb and brain dead.Get plenty of sleep, light breakfast.

But I was not aware of that until the very last interview.Anyway, they flew me to Redmond for the technical interviews. The technical questions were related to data structures and recursion: 4 interveiwers asked me to code a solution to a problem on a white board. If your solution is not the best (90% of the time it wont) they will ask you how would you improve it.The last interviewer finally told me that the whole time I was interviewing for a wrong position. SO I spoke with the coordinator and they told me they will try to fix it. They directed me to the recruiter who assigned me to that particular division.

The interview before me was taking awhile and they brought me up thirty minutes late. I sat in a conference room waiting patiently and then they brought me into the room to interview with the networking recruiter between the recruiting company and Microsoft and the department manager who was also a contractor for Microsoft. The interview they tried to get a hold of my personality, basic questions, etc. I tried to ask questions and get a feel for them and the job. They seemed generally impressed someone was willing to come in for this job with my background at the pay they were offering. The interview felt short and after it was over I called the recruiter to let them know how it went. Within an hour he had a phone call saying they wanted to hire me and to come in the next day to fill out paperwork.",

What followed was the standard microsoft interview loop (meet with a person, interview for an hour, then be asked to wait in the coffee lounge while the interviewer goes to talk to the next person).

A total of four interviews were given (everyone got the same amount, no one was sent home early or anything). Each one was 45 minutes, with a 15 minute break in between. The interviews weren't too hard - reverse the words of a string (example i/p: sunny in seattle o/p: seattle in sunny). If you read through Cracking the Coding Interview, it's really not too bad. I've interviewed at Google and Amazon and those interviews were much harder.At some point in the interview they feed you food, usually a pasta. My advice would be to avoid all the carbs, as my group had two interviews, then lunch, then two more interviews. After lunch, the people that ate a lot of carbs (pasta) were about ready to fall asleep, despite having two more interviews.One thing to point out about these interviews is that they will drain you, similar to walking out of the SAT. A few kids actually fell asleep on the way home from the interview because they were so mentally exhausted, so make sure you pace and prepare yourself.",

        "details": "The overall experience was really good. I've had other interviews with Microsoft and they've all been great. The structure is always the same:First contacted by either hiring manager or recruiter followed by a short phone screen to see if the person and the resume fits.After initial phone screen a \"loop\" is scheduled with multiple interviews on the same day \"on site\" at Microsoft. All information about how the loop would\u2026\u00a0 work, who I would meet, etc was given in advance. The recruiter and the interviewers were extremely professional throughout the entire process. The Microsoft loop is described in details all over the internet so I will not go into that. I went through six interviews of varying difficulty and details before being handed over to the \"asap\". Once at the asap I was pretty much told that I had a job if I wanted one and that they really wanted me to join their team - this is probably not general practice so don't expect your last interview to be a \"what can we do/say to make you join us\"-type of session.Each interview had it's own characteristics, but they all followed the same pattern: ice-breaker for a few minutes, asking about my past experiences, testing technical ability by a problem solving or design open-ended question of some sort, personality evaluation type of questions, and the final 5-10minutes to answer any questions I might have (and yes, I had questions of my own - you should too).I was asked not only \"management\" related questions. There were a few more in-depth technical \"problems\" to solve. I did not have to do whiteboard coding, but I did have to design programming APIs and break down and try to explain a real-life client-server based architecture. No questions were really unexpected or shook me out of my comfort zone, perhaps that had more to do with my familiarity by then with the Microsoft interview structure than the actual questions - some might find it difficult and unexpected to have to go into such deep technical details when applying for what is considered to be a management position. There was none of the infamous Microsoft \"brain teasers\" during this interview (though I've had them in other interviews).Throughout the interview day I had a really good experience. The team was definitely right for me as we \"clicked\" on most topics, and what turned out to be a seven hour day of interviews felt more like a short lunch - I had fun during the day! The team seemed very enthusiastic about their work and really passionate about Microsoft and the product they worked on and managed to convey that to me through their actions and answers to my own questions.",

She also asked about how I would\u2026\u00a0 go about testing a vending machine.In another 2 weeks I was invited to interview in Redmond in late September for a SDET position. Microsoft booked my flight, hotel for 2 nights, and rental car. On the interview day, I was there with 7 other SDET candidates. We had lunch, and then a series of 4 interviews that lasted 45 minutes each with 15 minute breaks in between. Each interview was with a Test Manager, and each one consisted of a few minutes of talking about my resume and then some technical questions. After all the interviews were over, we were free to go for the day, and they told us we'd know by the next day if we would be getting an offer. I had the evening free and went to Seattle to explore a bit. The next morning I got an email informing me I wouldn't be getting an offer.Overall it was a difficult but exciting process (free trip to Seattle!).

I had the feeling that all questions I asked related to travel, process etc were thought about and solved before I asked them.During my interviews I went with the Microsoft Connector shuttle several times. As they have meetings and other candidates that get further in the process it can happen that your meeting gets delayed one or two hours. I got a chance to visit the Microsoft Visitor center (that I contacted the week before to make sure they are open at that time) as well as the Microsoft Store on campus. One of the employees went to lunch with me at one of their awesome cafeterias. The food was delicious but I didn't have the chance to look over the whole menu - they offer way to much. When you arrive at Microsoft you get a voucher that's to be used by you and your interviewer, so you don't have to pay. The food is cheap so you can take a lot.My last interviewer told me he's very positive and will let the HR contact let me know asap (and not after two weeks) whether I got the position. At the end of your interview day when you go back to the recruiting building, they'll help you to visit sightseeings in town.Unfortunately I was contacted a few days later by my HR contact telling me I didn't get the position. The contact didn't tell me why, especially sad because of the positive statements of the last interviewers I had. Usually having 6 interviews is a very positive sign, regardless of whether they tell you their positive feeling or not. Could be related to a candidate that was better, could be related to some management/HR decision.",

The question was not clear at all and the person just turned her back on me and started typing an email on her desktop.

I was literally standing behind her for 10 minutes telling her that I have a solution. She did not like my solution so moved onto the next question. While I had different solutions, she had something in mind (Note: She was still typing on her computer faced against me)\u00a0At last, when I asked what was the solution to the second question, she was like 'Thats too many lines of code. I cannot explain'.\u00a0The rudest interview of my life. After that, it pretty much set the mood for me for the rest of the day.

        "details": "I first applied for the position while a recruiter was at my college for a job fair event. After that, I was contacted about a month or so later and scheduled a phone interview (or rather an online phone interview). The phone interview was all business, no personal questions. The interviewer asked me to start writing something that seemed somewhat simple, in whichever language I preferred. After a sufficient amount\u2026\u00a0 of time coding and asking questions (roughly 45 minutes) he had me stop and asked a couple of questions on my thought process in coding the answer. I was contacted a few days later and asked if I could fly out for an interview. I accepted and went to their headquarters in Washington.The day starts relatively early, around 9:30AM and goes \"until you're finished\". The basic process is they hand you the location of your first interview, either walk you there or get you a ride there, and continue handing you off between Microsoft employees that you will potentially be working with. Usually each person asks you a couple of personal questions and at least one coding question. Some people may seem like they're ignoring you or acting strangely around you, but I believe that's all part of the interview process. Asking questions is a vital part of the process, as they want someone who is willing to understand something from top to bottom before they attempt to write code for it.As some other reviews have said, towards the end of the day you may or may not meet with your fifth interviewer in the event that they may \"be busy\". Whether or not this is truly an indicator of your progress, I'm unsure. All I can say is I interviewed with four out of five people and did not receive the offer.

I was told this was for one particular game, so I went out and bought that game... learned it, did my homework, and prepped myself with questions and info pertaining to *that* game - only to find out the job was really to manage that game as well as half a dozen other games that I'd never been told about and had to answer questions on the spot.In the end, I did not get an offer.

For this one, I was asked to pitch as if I were talking to Ballmer. It didn't go well since I haven't thought of getting question like this before. Next I was asked to make a quick sales pitch for my product (a 2 mins pitch at, say a product fair). This was much better, and he had follow up questions (pretending to be a real audience).The other lead asked a scenario question which I was totally expecting it. He described the scenario, and I work on getting the information from him. Get all info before making a suggestion to the problem.The next interviewer focused on pure design question, I think the question was about designing a vending machine, but I couldn't remember the details. Certainly things to remember is to find out what problem we are trying to solve or what value we are trying to provide with the product/feature we are designing.The last interviewer was the Director of PM, not so technical.

        "details": "Initially turned in my resume during a campus career fair. Approximately two weeks later I was emailed by a recruiter who asked me to participate in an on-campus interview (i.e., first round).The campus interview was with someone who wasn't a recruiter and had clear technical expertise. This interview lasted approximately 25-30 minutes. We mostly talked about items on my resume, whether or not I faced any unique challenges and if\u2026\u00a0 so, how I overcame them. This was a very conventional interview. Upon the conclusion, I was asked a technical question.About three weeks later, I was emailed again by a different recruiter who asked me if I was available to fly out to Redmond, WA for the second round interview. I had a very compact window to interview within, and the recruiters did a great job setting everything up within my constraints.On interview day, the first step is to meet with another recruiter who is on-site, who will discuss the group / team you will be interviewing with, and answer any other questions you may have at the time. This recruiter is also the one who will tell you the results, and work further with you should you get an offer. After meeting the recruiter, you take a personal shuttle to the buildings where your interviewers are. Mine were all in the same building. Next you meet with 3-5 interviewers, and one of the interviews is a lunch interview. You are told beforehand that each interviewer passes on comments to the next one, presumably so they can confirm / deny a weakness.For me, the first interviewer didn't want to talk about my resume at all. He was more or less the manager of the group and was very blunt about the skills he was looking for. Some non-technical questions were: \"What would you change about Windows?\", \"What do you read to stay on top of the latest technology?\", \"What are some examples of trending applications?\". Then he went to the coding problems. One a mathematical proof, and the second more coding oriented.The next interview was over lunch, and this interviewer asked me initially about my research, but quickly started trending towards questions that were more oriented towards the group. After lunch we went back to his office and I was asked another coding problem.The third interview was more theoretical. The interviewer briefly talked about my research and that it looked interesting, and then we went into an open-ended math / optimization problem.After the third interview, I was told that I would not be seeing the fourth interviewer (this means you failed), and I was taken back to HR to discuss the day with the recruiter. I should point out that the recruiter was very helpful and looked into other groups that might have been a better fit.Overall, the interview was very challenging. You absolutely need to be prepared to code and solve difficult problems. The second round is not about what you have done, but rather what you can do now, in a high-pressure situation. Also, you are told that you can code in any language, but in reality, you need to be able to code in C/C#. Not being familiar with either, I tried to use Python so as to not get bogged down in syntax, but it was generally not well received.",

I was not asked any coding questions.Two months went by before I heard anything back from Microsoft and I was led to believe that I had been rejected since several candidates had received an invitation to\u2026\u00a0 interview onsite in Redmond, WA. Eventually, my recruiter told me that I had been selected to interview for an SDET role although he didn't tell me on which team (this is only communicated to you on the day of the interview). From this point on, it took another month-and-a-half or so to schedule the onsite interview in Redmond.From this point on though, the process was smooth sailing and I received an e-mail asking to confirm travel details. The trip and itinerary was booked swiftly. On the day of the interview, I met with the onsite recruiter who told me which team I would be interviewing for as well as answered some soft/HR-type questions. I was given some suggestions/advice from the recruiter on how to approach the technical portion of the interview.I had a day worth of onsite interviews with mostly technical questions. We went a bit overtime although I found that each interviewer was friendly and very proud of the work they were doing. They were also more than happy to answer any questions that I had as well as give feedback on my performance on the interview. The format of the interviews was a brief introduction followed by two technical questions. The first was generally on how to test a particular piece of software and the second was usually a whiteboard coding question.After 5 interviews, I met the Hiring Manager who I feel was evaluating my 'fit' for the organization. The questions here were a mixture of technical/non-technical ones.ADVICE:- Although it has probably been stated elsewhere, I cannot stress the importance of knowing the following things:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Data Structures (Stacks, Queues, Trees, Heaps, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, etc.) as well as how the various operations on those data structures work\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Being Able to Reason Time Complexity in code that you've written/seen (especially operations on data structures)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0- Coding on a whiteboard/without a debugger- I would also suggest going on the internet and getting some practice with coding problems (TopCoder, CodeKata, HackerRank, Leetcode, etc. etc. etc.)",

        "details": "Applied online via website. Got a request for a phone interview about a month later. Phone interview was about 30 minutes and mainly asked like what parts of software you like dealing with (UI, Backend, Application layer etc) and then a test question (how would you test a ____ ) and a small math/logic brainteaser.Got an email about 3 weeks later saying they would like to skip the next round\u2026\u00a0 of phone interviews and fly me out to Seattle for final rounds of interviews. Due to the holidays, the process got delayed a bit, but I set up flight/hotel and my day of interviews.The whole trip was excellent, I felt like I was really being taken care of. They will reimburse a generous amount of money for things like food, transportation around the city. They even gave me some taxi vouchers on my interview day so I could explore Seattle and I wouldn't even have to pay, and it would get billed to Microsoft directly.The on-site interview day is a long and challenging day, yet it was still enjoyable. You start out in the recruitment building where all the other candidates will be as well. You'll get individually called out by your recruiter who you meet with first. Then you are taken via Microsoft Connect vehicles to the building in which your team you will be interviewing with works.I had 4 interviews, all technical. Every interview started out with a bit of resume talk, future plans and things about your time at school. Then we did 1 or 2 programming problems each. The technical problems are pretty industry standard, ranging from string manipulation to data structures, to graph theory. Just be sure to talk your way through them with the interviewer. All the interviewers asked even more probing questions to see how much you know about a subject. They asked me all the way down to actually implementing a hashing function when the topic of HashSets came up. But remember, it's okay to admit you don't know at a certain point!They seem pretty agnostic about what language you use, and one interviewer even started the interview by saying that he is not a compiler, and will not care if there are small syntax errors. That was reassuring and put my mind to ease for small things.There is also a lunch interview where you get some a lunch voucher to pay for you and your interviewer's lunch. Very light discussion during lunch, mostly about resume and past projects.After all this, you will meet with your recruiter back at the recruitment building. My interviews went from 10am-5pm. Like previously stated, they gave me some taxi vouchers and I explored Seattle all night before returning to my hotel and catching my flight back the next morning. I can't wait to start!",

        "details": "I had submitted a resume online back in December 2012, but was first contacted by a recruiter in early February. She emailed me, and we set up a conference call for the next day. After chatting with her about the position and my resume, she had indicated that the hiring manager (a Director) was interested in my background, and we set up a call for two days later between myself\u2026\u00a0 and the hiring manager.That phone conversation went well also. Talked with the hiring manager about the position, his expectations, their products, the corporate structure of their team and how they are organized by product line. At the end of the call, the manager indicated that he wanted me to fly up to Redmond for face-to-face interviews, and he was interested in me due to the fact that I was currently working with a competitor, involved in the same type of software licensing realm this his team is involved with.The on-site interviews went very well. It was a long day (5 one hour interviews), but it felt like they went by very quickly. I interviewed with the hiring manager again, a Sr. Product Manager who would be one of my peers, and other product managers and directors from other teams. Most of the interviews were very relaxed, get-to-know-you type conversations. The peer asked more business case questions, where there was not really a correct answer, but testing to see how you think through the problem. I thought I was a little shaky on this part, trying to get a feel if I was answering the question in the manner that he was seeking.I flew back home, and was informed that the General Manager (the hiring manager's boss) was out of town while I was there, and they would make a decision on the 3 final candidates who would get to do a final phone conversation with the GM. Fortunately, I was selected, and was set up for a phone call with him the following week. I think this is the \"final stamp of approval\" type scenario. The phone conversation went very well with the GM, just like the others. He was doing more of the selling Microsoft and living in Seattle, telling me about his life experiences and how he ended up with Microsoft. He then did a little testing on my passion for technology, which is very important at Microsoft. We talked about different products (not related to what the role would be involved with), asking me questions about how I would approach competitively positioning the products. At the end of the call, we discussed salary expectations, and it ended with him letting me know that they would get back to me soon with a decision.Two days later, I received an email from the recruiter with their offer. Based on the salary averages for the position that I saw here on Glassdoor, it was pretty much on that mark. I negotiated for a little more, and they met my counter-offer the next day. At this point, I accepted the job.Overall, a very pleasant experience. And the recruiter and others who organized the interview process were always quick to respond to questions and informed me of all details throughout.",

        "details": "I submitted my resume online. But it was at the end of year (in december) and the HR said they will be contacting me only in jan or Feb as they normally freeze the hiring fr new grads at that time. As said they contacted me in Feb and asked scheduled a time for a phone screening with one of the dev engineers.The phone screening was normal. The person who\u2026\u00a0 contacted me was easy to communicate with. He asked about myself, the projects i worked with and what are my interests and what products that interests me and which team I would like to work with in Microsoft. This was to get an overall idea of where your interest lies in and which team would be a fit for you. Followed by it was a simple algorithm question on linked list to delete a node and to do it in optimized way. Have to give out all the corner cases.After nearly two weeks they called me for an onsite interview. And the process was pretty smooth. Every day i used to receive mails from HR of the things that I need to do and about the travel ad stay. And even received a 'best wishes' mail from them prior to the day of interview.On the day of interview, I was interviewed by 5 people. It involves both technical and behavioral questions. Interview was held at cubicles of the respective engineers and managers.First interview was about detailing my resume. He asked about all the projects that was in my resume. So be well prepared. And also asked if I had any conflicts with other people on the course of project work and how I resolved it. Followed by it was white board coding problems. First it was about how i approach the problem and then have to write a code. Asked about time complexity.Second interview was about the projects again. And he asked me particularly about my internship project. And then asked to solve a problem. We discussed the pros and cons of my approach and then asked to write code. Asked for time complexity. For one problem he asked about the downfall for the approach and then asked if i could find a way to resolve it. I gave him the solution and was moved to the third interview.Third interview was lunch interview. I had no clue about the team I am going to interview with before that morning. And that is the policy of Microsoft not to let the candidates know the team they are going to interview with. So you cant research about them. And so lunch interview is all about you talking. Be ready to question and speak. It all about it. How much you are interested in the job and the team and how good are you at communicating. I started with business model of the team, architecture, technologies used, compared with other technologies, competitors, new features. I also commented on the negative aspects of the product and compared with the features of others. But don't stop talking.If you do well with first three interviews then you will be invited for the fourth one.My fourth interview was more about coming up with my data structure for the problem and then solving a given problem and writing an API. Try to start with normal approach and to make it optimized. And speak your thoughts, even if it may be wrong. They are more than willing to help you out if you are struck. Again this one involved the conflicts you encountered and your influence on any project. It need not be something big. Just show them that you have your opinion and you are in a position to voice it.If you get through the fourth interview , you will be invited for fifth one with the dev manager or director of the team.This one is not technical, but purely you interest again. It was again 60 min of interview.And after one day I was informed that I got selected.",

The initial phone interview was with a recruiter and asked both HR questions and technical questions. One question asked was: There are 8 marbles, one is heavier than the rest, and you are allowed to use a balance. How would you find the overweight marble by using the balance as little as possible? (Answer: Measure two groups\u2026\u00a0 of three marbles against each other. If they're even, you know one of the remaining two marbles is the overweight one, and can measure once more for a total of two balance uses. If one of the groups of 3 is overweight, then measure one marble from that group against another marble from that group. If they're even, it is the remaining marble that is overweight, otherwise you'll know which marble is overweight from the balance. This gives a total of 2 balance uses to find the overweight marble, which turned out to be the correct answer). Another question I had was how to test a printer.I received an offer to interview on-site in Seattle. I met with the recruiter in the morning who told me the team I was interviewing for, and that I would meet up with her at the end of the day. I had four interviews in total.

        "details": "Microsoft had stopped by my university (University of Illinois at Chicago) for our career fair, the day before they held a hiring event. I turned my resume into a recruiter and got maybe a minute at most to discuss some things (there were a good 200 people and around 4 recruiters so they were trying to move quick). About two weeks later I got an email saying they'd like to\u2026\u00a0 set up an on-site interview.Going into the interview it became apparent that the recruiter had guessed which position to place us in (PM, SDE, or SDET), I was suggested for an SDET position. The first interview was still an overall interview to see which would be a best fit. We discussed basic interview questions like what group projects I had worked on, what I plan to do with my career, why I'd like to work for Microsoft and so on. There was a design question, asking how I'd change the room we were sitting in. There was also a programming question, reversing the characters of words within a string (ex. 'Here is a string' to 'ereh si a gnirts'). I answered both answers going into a lot of detail, but he was impressed with the design question and passed on a recommendation for a PM position.Two weeks later I was contacted saying I was moving on to the next round and they'd contact me to set up a phone interview for a PM position. The phone interview covered most of the same questions as the first interview, but with more of an emphasis on the PM role. The first question was to design a watch, which took roughly 15 minutes to complete going through every possible aspect of it (marketing, target audience, various price builts, build, etc.). Following that was a relatively standard brainteaser. At the very end they asked if I would be interested in the MSIT program. We didn't have much time so I only got a brief description, but I agreed to it and the interview ended.Another two weeks later I get an email saying I was moving onto the final round in Redmond for an SDE/SDET position in the MSIT program. There was a good amount of paperwork but the recruiter I worked with helped me with any issues I had. They picked up the tab for the flight, rental car and hotel, as well as reimbursement for food during my visit.Fast forward another five weeks. Shuttle's were parked outside of my hotel in Bellevue (a town close to Redmond) at 7am to pick up about 20 candidates going to three different locations on campus. Upon arrival we were brought into a really nice lobby and offered food and beverages. From there we were set up with four interviews at 45 minutes a piece.After my first interview I quickly realized that I had made a mistake with my resume. I mentioned that I had worked with relational databases, and I put a little too much emphasis on it. Each interviewer dealt with databases, and three of them focused on just those concepts. For the most part I was able to hold my own, but my second interviewer really grilled me and I definitely fumbled. The questions he asked me were out of my scope. I answered as best as I could, but I asked for more hints than I would have liked. The other two databases interviews were on much broader subjects that I am comfortable with.Another common theme between all of them was testing. All of my questions were followed up instantly with, \"alright, now how do we test this?\" The immediate response I had was always testing out functionality (which is something I do in my job). The answer they were looking for, and would eventually get out of me, is other concepts like concurrency, CPU/memory usage and exception handling. So with those items in mind, how would we test to make sure we won't run into those issues, or how do we test to see if they are indeed an issue.Asking around between interviews I realized I was one of few that was getting these types of questions. Everyone else had standard fare programming questions, something I had prepared for. I only briefly studied for databases, so learn from my mistake. If it's on your resume, make sure you know it well!Rather than keep us all waiting on campus they shuttled us back to our hotel around 1pm, letting us know we'd hear from them within the next four hours. The next stretch seemed to last for forever. 6pm came and no word, I sent them an email around 7pm to gauge where they were at. Around 10pm I got a text from Michael (the University Staffing Ninja as his email signature suggets) saying he had been busy and I should hear within the hour. About 4 minutes to midnight I got an email stating that I had been given an offer and a follow up call would go over the details. In that respect, they kept their promise that I'd get results the same day.Overall, I really enjoyed the experience. It's made clear that even though they dish out a good chunk of change to have you visit Redmond, it's not a guaranteed position. They can tell you have potential, and this is your time to really impress your potential teammates.",

        "details": "Like other postings on this site have indicated, the standard hiring process with engineering seems to be one technical phone screen and a day of fun and games on site (provided that the phone screen went well). This was my second interview with Microsoft. Back in 2008, I interviewed for an SDET position for which I received an offer and graciously accepted. I voluntarily left the company 2 years later\u2026\u00a0 because I did not enjoy my work as an SDET. Contrary to what the recruiter will tell you, it's quite difficult to move around within the company once you're there. I've found that it's actually much easier to just leave the company and come back on your own terms -- which is pretty much how I did it. Although one piece of advice there: make sure you have a rock star record before leaving because they save that stuff and will review it if you return. This was a bridge that I made absolutely sure *not* to burn on my way out.I was contacted by an MSFT recruiter about an SDE position. I did an initial phone interview with someone. He was quite personable and asked me a lot of questions about things on my resume. There was one particular personal side-project that he thought was interesting and we discussed it at great depth for maybe 45 minutes. The questions didn't feel quizzical, but rather like he was actually interested and engaged in what I had done.Then he asked some basic work related questions around how the file system at my current company works. Next, we did some coding in a shared document. This part wasn't bad. He asked me to insert a node in to a binary search tree (BST) and then balance it. All in all, I wrote the code to insert a node, get current balance of the tree, determine the current height of any node, and the rotate_left and rotate_right functions in the case where a rotation is needed to restore the balance. It was around 120 lines of code give or take. All done in the C programming language. Not bad. The bottom line in any interview is that if it's on your resume, it's fair game.Then they brought me on campus for a full round of interviews. They scheduled me to talk to 4 different folks which were on an itinerary that they gave to me in the lobby when I walked in. What they don't tell you though is that each interviewer is a gate-keeper to the next, so if at any point in time you don't do well, then it's \"game over\". If, however, you do well, you'll end up finishing the entire schedule, plus doing at 2-3 additional bonus interviews. I went in around 9:30 and left some time after 5. Keep in mind that this doesn't mean that you'll receive an offer, but if you're shown the door before you finish (minimally) what's on your schedule, that's probably a bad sign.I went in there with my coding weapons off safety -- but I didn't feel like I was grilled as thoroughly (technically) as I should have been. I was asked a lot of design questions mostly around locking, thread synchronization, and scheduling, data compression and snapshot operations on file systems. All in all, I didn't have any trouble with anything and the interviews felt more like a conversation about the things that I am passionate about. I expected to write more code than they asked me to -- and certainly I was prepared. Each interviewer will make a recommendation to the next on where to focus their attention in an attempt to find a weakness -- similarly, they'll also recommend areas to skip if your skill level in that particular area is already of known (good) quantity. They're constantly probing in different places throughout the day, scanning for a weakness, and if you're strong in something, my observation has been that they will adjust their approach (as opposed to continuing to set'em up and allowing you to knockin'em down). I demolished the first couple of coding problems early on and I think that's why they changed vantage points to a most holistic approach -- they wanted to know if I could see the \"big picture\". At one point in the day, I even asked for another coding problem at which point, I was politely declined. So then I offered to give them one instead. Again, denied, lol.My day ended sometime between 5pm and 6pm. I can't exactly remember what time it was (perhaps 5:30), but it was dark out (and cold!). Having done it twice now, the one best piece of advice I'd give to anyone is to get a lot of sleep the night before, rather than study. Studying the night before won't save you. :) Regardless of the technical level of difficulty, this process can be quite nerve-racking. Emotionally, it takes its toll and by the end, I was exhausted.They called me three days later and said that they wanted to move forward with an offer.",

I got five interviews and the last one was with a very nice senior person working there for 35 years and still I\u2026\u00a0 got rejected.Went to Redmond a few months ago in a snowy winter day! There were five interviews:1) A very strict (but polite) person, no smile on the face, explicitly telling me that he wont help me and wont give me any hints. It was all about quickly writing a bug-free C++ code to find a pattern in a string, implementing a post order tree traversal with and without recursion and a few research/design problems.2) An extremely nice korean guy who asked about hash tables/lookup/insert/collision in HT and implementation in C++. There was another question about writing all permutations of a given string.3 and lunch interview) A very nice person, willing to help: He told me to develop an algorithm for finding whether a matrix has some properties or not. It was 5 months ago and I forgot the question. I could solve the question but he was looking for a more efficient algorithm. He was willing to help and gave me hints but time was up and he gave me to the next interviewer. he told me that I was going to the right direction.4) The fourth interviewer was very odd. I hope his behavior was planned/intentional and he is not like this. From our conversation, it was obvious that this guy is very smart. He wrote a long input string with lots of delimiters in the white board and asked me to write a c-code to change the given string it to another format based on some rules. It was a horribly vague, twisted question with lots of unknowns and exceptions. In the interview, he was taking nap time to time and he left the room at least three times. Again I hope that this was a test to see my reaction. The reason that I hope for the best is that at the end of the interview, he was the only person who gave me very honest feedbacks and compliments. But if it is not the case, that was awfully/extremely rude. So he passed me to the final interviewer...5) a senior manager, working in MS for 35 years. Very cool, very smart and very fun, It could be easily observed by the flags/decoration in the room/some wine on the table in his room!!! By the way, I didnt have any whatsoever behavioral questions during my day. So this time, he just started chatting with me which I guess was the behavioral part of the interview. Talking about everything except work, about big corporations, hacking!! and so on. It was truly an amazing experience with that person.Based on the book, I surely have gotten the job, but ....One week later, I got rejected.",

I submitted my resume online for a job posting I saw on Linkedin that closely matched my experience and future career interests. Two weeks after I submitted my resume, a recruiter at Microsoft contacted me by phone and asked to set up time for a phone\u2026\u00a0 screen. It was definitely not just a basic HR screen but a true interview where I was asked questions directly related to the skills and content knowledge required for the job, so definitely prepare for that. During the call, the recruiter told me he would definitely recommend to the hiring manager that she should speak with me. Another phone interview was then set up with the hiring manager for the next week. We had an hour conversation that was less of an interview and more about her vision for the position and how my experience and ideas would fit into that. After that I was contacted by the same recruiter and told that I would have an on-campus interview. This was rescheduled once so it took another 3 weeks before I had my in-person interview at Microsoft. I was given a schedule of 4 interviewers and ended up speaking with 5 in a very small department, so although I felt like I did very well it's still a mystery if I completed my \"loop\" or not. Two weeks later I was contacted by the recruiter and told I didn't get the position but to apply for others, and received a lot of positive feedback, which should have been helpful but left me feeling confused about why I did not receive an offer.",

        "details": "I applied online for a new grad position. I was contacted for a phone interview shortly after. My phone interview was about 30 minutes long and consisted of no coding questions. There was one brain teaser about measuring water using a couple buckets and the most technical question I was asked was what are the differences between C and C++.From there, I was notified about 10 days later that I\u2026\u00a0 would be moving forward to final round interviews for an SDE position in Fargo, ND, and that I would be hearing from a scheduler soon to set up my interview day. 10 days after that the scheduler emailed me about setting up a day to come to Redmond to interview. Then she apologized that she had made a mistake and that I was actually interviewing in Fargo. I provided my availability and then heard nothing for about 3 weeks. By this point, I had already had my onsite interview with Amazon (I applied to both companies at the same time) so I emailed my scheduler to ask if any progress had been made. She said I had a tentative date, and reemphasized 3 times that it was tentative, that would be at the Friday of the following week. She said she would contact me again when the date was closer.Jump ahead one week to Monday. I received an offer from Amazon and still had not had a date confirmed with Microsoft, so I emailed my scheduler to politely inform her that I did not wish to move forward. I got a response almost instantly saying she was \"just able\" to get my interview confirmed for the upcoming Friday, which gave me 4 days notice, and asked if I still wanted to come out to Fargo. I replied again saying that I wasn't interested. Then I heard from my original recruiter who was basically begging me not to pass on the opportunity to interview and consider Microsoft. She said if location was the issue, she could reschedule me ASAP for an interview in Redmond. So I agreed to fly out to Seattle if they could get it scheduled within the timeframe that I needed to reply to Amazon in.The next email I got was from someone I had not been in contact with yet, saying \"I hope you're getting excited for your interviews, blah blah, safe travels!\" and I was confused. Was this person referring to my interview that had been confirmed for Fargo, or a new interview in Seattle? I responded asking what was going on and she replied saying \"Disregard my email and work with your scheduler to get a date set.\" It was not until Wednesday evening that I was informed I was interviewing that same Friday in Seattle. I got a call from the travel department trying to set up last minute flights, and flew out the next night.When I arrived for the onsite interview, I sat in a lobby with about 15 other candidates for about 40 minutes waiting for someone to come retrieve me to start my interview day. This someone turned out to be the same person who had emailed me earlier in the week to wish me safe travels before I had an interview confirmed. When we sat down to talk, we discussed the confusion and I tried to put it all out of my mind so we could move forward. Then she says, \"So, you're here to interview for an SDET position.\" Um, what? I was told SDE. There is a difference between the way you interview for a developer and a tester position. She went to double check and then confirmed that yes, I was interviewing for a testing spot then tried to pitch the testing position to me and asked me to keep an open mind, while trying to convince me that the interviews are basically the same for either spot and that the job responsibilities overlap a lot. If you look at Microsoft's website where they have information for preparing for interviews, you can see there is quiet a difference between the two types of interviews.So the rest of my day consisted of 4 interviews with testers. I feel that I answered their coding questions well (none of them seemed very hard) but I was clearly unprepared to answer so many testing questions. I wasted their time and my time making that trip to Seattle. I respect the 4 people I interviewed with and learned a lot about Microsoft's SDET role from, and I feel like a jerk for coming in without having done much prep in the testing arena.At the end of the day, my interviewer said she figured out what had happened. Regardless of the reason, someone should have communicated to me that I was interviewing for test rather than dev BEFORE I showed up for the interview. And she said that she had emailed and asked the interviewers to consider me for both SDE and SDET after the day had started. I don't know how many of them got the memo or how a testing team is supposed to say, yeah, give her an offer for some other team who has never met her, but either way I was notified the following Monday that I was not going to receive an offer.

No technical questions on phone interview. Contacted me shortly after to let me know a position was available for SDET\u2026\u00a0 at the Mountain View location. Set up in person interview and flew out to see them.Spoke with an amazing team that worked on Outlook. Had a total of five interviews throughout the day.1) First interview, great guy. Really fun to talk to, discussed testing, reliability via redundancy and other issues and challenges of distributed systems.Technical Question: how would you test the responsiveness of one node from another node in a network of two connected servers.2) Second interview, also a great guy. Worked on test automation and talked to me about various testing schemes and benchmarks they observe and work on.Technical Question: how would you test that two strings are anagrams of each other.3) Third interview, really nice guy too but he was fiddling around with his phone while I was working on the technical problem on the whiteboard which made me feel like I was a high school teacher trying to get him to understand and pay attention. Talked about his work testing the products on various consumer personal electronic devices.Technical Question: describe and implement a search algorithm. (I picked quicksort)4) Fourth interview, cool guy. Talked about the company and opportunities in the future. Grilled me on academics (my GPA, why it was what it was, what else I was doing in college, etc.)Technical Question: picked one of the projects on my resume and asked me to explain it to him as if he's a 6th grader.5) Fifth interview, also a really great guy. Fun to talk to also spoke with him about Microsoft the team and what they were doing. He was an international transplant so I asked him about opportunities across the globe with the company. I forgot how to do the simplest brute-force solution for the problem and spent A LOT of time on the question trying to figure out a generalized pattern that would serve to give me an efficient algorithm. He presented me with the simplest, recursive, \"try every board configuration\" solution, mentioned that I know Dijkstra found the solution to it, but I can't remember it. He chuckled a bit.Technical Question: 8 queens problem.Outside of the actual interviews and on-campus experience which was the best part of my trip everything else sucked, nobody's fault though just a couple of those Acts of God that come with travelling. For example, on my drive to the interview I got caught for 45 minutes on the OFF RAMP to the campus. Not even the highway traffic, just the one off ramp had morning rush hour cause I guess Google and some of the other guys also had their campuses down the street.",

After the interview, you go back to the room with the other recruits and sit there nervously playing Xbox for 15 minutes until the next interview.The interview questions weren't particularly difficult, certainly easy enough to do in a proper setting for a programming project. Even though I don't get nervous during interviews, however, it is still difficult to do these questions in front of a whiteboard to the interviewer. It was hard to properly articulate my entire thought process, especially if I noticed I made an error or a broad assumption earlier on.Overall it was a very good experience. The recruiters were professional, very helpful with travel arrangements, and microsoft pays for the flight, taxi, hotel, and food (submit reimbursement for food later on).

They always finish with a small logic puzzle which are pretty easy and\u2026\u00a0 you've probable even worked with if you've been programming for a while.Afterwards, you're supposed to fly to Redmond but they gave me a 50/50 thing, where I would take 2-3 interviews by phone to screen you, and if you pass you fly to Redmond for the last batch. The interviewer by phone asked me some questions about pointers, recursion, and some basic data structures, but he took it as in depth as possible. Definitely brush up on your Data Structures.After this, I got sent to Redmond where I had 2 interviews. One was with someone from MS Office. She was a charming lady who just portrayed peace to me, so it was really nice. She asked me to write a pre-order traversal that worked iteratively instead of recursively. This wasn't bad at all but again: data structures.My next interview was with a guy from server (Azure to be more specific). He asked me to make a Stack, but he took it down to ever little. Since I wanted it do it with a Linked List he asked me to implement a Linked List first and just kept squeezing every little detail out. Afterwards, he asked me to make it thread safe which was very easy. Then he through a trick question at me about how exceptions would make my stack fail...and I didn't get the answer.About 45 mins later a guy from HR took me to a room to tell me that I didn't get the position. He was very cool about it and MS Staff is extremely friendly, which is somewhat bad since it's harder to read how you do. All in all, great experience and I hope to make it next year.",

I scheduled it a week out to give me time to\u2026\u00a0 study. I didn't think I did so great but got an email saying they would like to move forward with on-site! Yay!!!!!Went on-site and from most interview stories, I knew that if I didn't make it past No 3 interviewer, I was screwed. I was so nervous as we ended the 3rd interview and at the end he said \"Someone else would like to meet you\" I did a dance when he turned his back!! The first 3 interviews were technical in nature; 60 mins each except the lunch interview which was 90 mins. I must say that Msoft has the best interview process. The interviewers were nice, cordial and really trying to help me succeed unlike some of the other tech company interviews I have been to. They also had senior people interview me so I guess having experienced interviewers makes a diff.After the 4th interview with the hiring manager, I met another senior engineer from a different team who was there to validate all that the other interviewers had said. I was sure this was the last then I was told I was to meet one more person! The hiring manager's manager! I was burnt out at this point. One look at my face and he said \"Its obviously been a long day, I won't keep you for long\". I was relieved to hear that.From the 5th interview, it was all general chatting about school I graduated from, behavioral questions, how many apps on my phone, passions and so on.In all I had 7 interviews including the recruiters'. My day started at 9.45am and ended at 5pm. It was well worth it cos I got the offer the next business day!!! I'm sooooo excited!!!!Goodluck to everyone trying to get in. Just keep working at it and don't give up. I have been rejected at Amazon, Google, Facebook and on my first try with Microsoft I got it!!!",

I was encouraged by the recruiter to apply online for the MS Explorer Internship program. So I applied online and was contacted by the recruiter for an initial phone-screening interview.Phone Interview---------------------This was standard HR screening interview. Few questions about teamwork, past projects, why I study computer engineering, why I want to\u2026\u00a0 work for Microsoft, favourite technologies, etc. I was then emailed about a week later saying that I had moved onto the final round interviews and I would be flown out to Redmond, WA. The recruiting was very efficient in setting up my hotel and my airline tickets (all expenses paid, including food!!).In-person, 1:1 interview loop------------------------------------The interview process for Explorers is a bit different than normal intern interviews. We all interview together at the same (in 3 \"waves\", I was in the 2nd wave of Explorer interviews). It was really fun because since we were all in Redmond at the same time, the HR recruiters had a mixer event for us the first night (with appetizers!) at the visitor center and I got to mingle and meet the other interviewees and full-time employees. Everyone was very friendly. Then the next morning I was bused to the MS campus with the other interviewees to the MS recruiting building (building 111, for those who don't know). I interviewed with the Office and Xbox teams, 3 interviews in total. Since it was for the Explorer program, it was a mix of PM/dev/test questions. They were all fairly easy since Explorer program is only for 1st & 2nd years. I had a lot of fun with my interviews!After Interviews-------------------Microsoft is the only company that flies interns all the way out to their offices to interview them and then give them money to spend to explore Seattle. They gave us pre-paid meal cards to eat lunch together at the Commons. I ate with several other interns and later in the day, myself and the other interns went to downtown Seattle. We ate at a fancy seafood restaurant (food paid for by Microsoft!) and visited the Seattle Space Needle. It was a fantastic night, very fun. Majority of the interns I went out with were also offered internships, so I had a group of friends for the summer already. And I'm still friends with these people :)Overall, it was a great interview experience and I don't think I'll ever have another one quite like it :)",

I received an email about coordinating the times. I sent a response. A week later the\u2026\u00a0 scheduler sends an email asking for a response. I told her I had responded and she replied saying she had found the email. Because of this the whole process got delayed and me and the scheduler kept going back and forth with available days until I get a surprise call from a Microsoft recruiter asking if I had any questions for my interview tomorrow. I was still in San Diego. I had not received anything about an interview date or confirming it. It ended up being their mistake and eventually the scheduler told me that the positions had been filled for that year and to try again next year. It was so disappointing because it was my third time interviewing with them and it was my first time I got invited up to Seattle and because of their mistake I didn't even get a chance to try.",

They will make you feel extremely comfortable and will be very friendly. The interviewers talk to one another between the interviews so make sure to make a good impression on the first one (not that they are completely biased, but im sure it helps).(questions they asked me are listed below)Be prepared to talk to them about your personal or school projects and how you \"solved problems\".

All of my behavioral questions were from my resume - \"tell me about the challenges you faced in this project\", \"tell me what you did in this project\", etcASK QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU START ANSWERING!! I cannot emphasize this enough. If its a technical question, ask what format the inputs are available in.

Some questions that were asked involved a voltage clipper circuit, BJT amplifiers, and some digital logic.A couple weeks after\u2026\u00a0 this interview, they contacted me for a final round at the MS headquarters in Redmond, WA. Since I lived within ~15 miles I opted to drive there myself, though they did offer plane/hotel accommodations for out of state applicants. Once I got there, I was briefed by a different recruiter who explained that I would be in 3-5 interviews with engineers from the Xbox team.The interview process was very straightforward, and all of the engineers I talked to were extremely friendly and put me at ease. Mostly I was surprised at the lack of technical and puzzle questions throughout the interview (I got asked more technical questions during the screening). The first interviewer asked me to explain several transistor/op amp type circuits and asked detailed questions about some of my previous projects in school. The second interviewer was very laid back and asked general questions about my background and why I wanted to work there. After this, I had a lunch interview (yes, I had to answer all sorts of behavioral questions in between chews) and then met with the 4th. I guess I met expectations at this point, because my next interviewer was the hiring manager who oversaw the division. He asked me some tough questions about my background (probably to make sure I was really qualified) and then answered a lot of questions I had about the role.About 5 days later I got a call from the recruiter saying that I got the position!

The only specific question I remember involved being in an\u2026\u00a0 office with a window and trying to determine the weather outside without using the internet (the answer boiled down to - go outside/stick your hand out the window). The interviewer encouraged me to read two books: How to Move Mt.

Protip: READ THESE BOOKS. Many of my questions during the interview phase involved some version of these mental puzzles, and one of them basically mimicked a scenario from the Nordstrom book.

I was also asked two of the famous brain teaser type questions, a handful of testing/coding questions and multiple design questions. Was told\u2026\u00a0 I passed about an hour after the screen.4.) Flown out to Redmond for onsite interview: consisted of five hour-long 1:1 interviews with various Program Managers/Directors and a hiring manager for the team I was interviewing to join. Questions ranged from resume review/experience questions to design questions of both a general nature (e.g. design a new in-car entertainment system) and related to the specific products/technologies that team was working with.Microsoft's recruiting team works very fast (I had other offer deadlines and they were aggressive in accommodating this; first contact to on-site in Redmond literally only took about two weeks) and they take care of you if you make it out to Redmond: you'll stay in an excellent hotel near the campus and will have a rental car for the duration of your stay (up to three days). Parking, food ($75 per diem), mileage to/from your home airport and tourism expenses will all be reimbursed within reason. They also gave me free passes to the Space Needle and Chihuly Glass museum; you're encouraged to explore when you aren't interviewing.If I have one (major) problem with the university recruiting process, it's the general lack of transparency and choice: unlike most other companies, you have zero say in which role you're selected for and what product teams you'll interview with and you won't find out more until the day you arrive on their campus (tech recruiting is extremely competitive right now and I have no doubt the campus visit is the biggest part of the sell--they don't want you declining the final round interview before they have a chance to get you on site). The team I was paired to was a pretty terrible fit for my skills and interests (and I was already wary about things I knew about Microsoft's internal culture, so I was very particular about this).

        "details": "Altogether there were three interview rounds that lapsed a span of 1 month.Round 1 was a 30 minute phone interview that consisted of multiple HR questions and two logic questions. The HR questions were basically me talking about my past projects and difficult problems I encountered and how I overcame them. The logic problems are as follows:1. Someone codes and interface that consists of 3 input text boxes and a\u2026\u00a0 start button. When the start button is pressed a triangle will be drawn on the screen. Each side of the triangle will correspond to a length in one of the input boxes. How would you test this program?2. You are in a room by yourself and someone walks into the room, asks you to find the temperature, and leaves. How would you find the temperature in the room without leaving the room?Round 2. So after waiting my 2 weeks for the results I made it past the first round. Because Microsoft does not visit my area (Southern Ontario, Canada) to recruit, my second interview was another phone interview. This one however consisted of a 1 hour HR phone interview followed by a 1 hour break then a 1 hour Technical interview. The first hour I spoke with a PM and he asked me a few questions about myself and about situations and my resume. Pretty standard HR interview. The second interview was definitely the MOST challenging of all the coding questions.Question:We have a quadtree algorithm and we are assuming that the boxes are labeled 0 (top left), 1 (top right), 2 (bottom left), 3 (bottom right) 'n' times. Write a function that when given an array input of n size (ie. [0,0,0,0] or [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] would be the top left corner) would determine if the corresponding box has at least one side touching at least one of the outermost walls.Round 3. So I made it through Phase 2 (much to my excitement/surprise) and the third round was an interview in Redmond, WA on the campus. The interview started at 8am and after talking with the recruiter for a bit consisted of 2 interviews 1h15m each with a 15 minute break in between. Both involved coding and HR questions with only one interviewer.Interview 1:Write a function (in your preferred language C, C++, or Java) that will take the given string and return the reverse. (ie. input:\"abc def ghi\" output:\"ihg fed cba\")Optimize the above code (if possible).Now knowing that the original function you wrote in pt1 is being used by other programs and cannot be modified write another function that when called will utilize the function from pt1 to only reverse the words in the sentence. (ie. input:\"abc def ghi\" output:\"ghi def abc\")Test your code.Interview 2:Write a function that when given a string will return the position of the starting point of the largest reoccurring character. (ie. given:\"AAABBCCCCD\" would return 5 (starting point of C))Test your code.",

The phone interview also included several \"Case-like\" questions that analyzes the candidate's logic, critical thinking, and analytical abilities. Depending on the division one is applying for, the interviewer will ask you more role-specific questions (a la \"How would you market the Xbox differently\" if you're going for that team).II. Second Round Notifications:You get a nice email from Microsoft that you'll be flown out to Washington. Great experience! They put you up in a great hotel, get a rental car for you, and take care of all your general food expenses :]III. Dinner Reception:Meet and mingle with newly hired \"Microsofties\" over some great food. Learn about their experiences and show that you're a sociable and normal person!IV.

Apparently I passed because I was given a formal invitation to the hiring event in Redmond. Microsoft paid for my airfare, car rental and hotel.I arrived at Microsoft early to find the doors locked. Other interviewees and I\u2026\u00a0 stood outside until another interviewee, who happened to be already inside, opened the door for us. We slowly met the Microsoft recruiting staff. With one bright exception, they were dressed like slobs and had few answers. It was only then I learned the group with whom I would be interviewing--it was a group in which I had no interest. I would have rejected the interview outright had I known this information from the beginning. I seriously considered walking out.The dozen of us were each ushered into small, very nice, interview rooms with a table, two chairs and a white board. We all had four, 45 minute, interviews with a 15 minute break between. This bothered me because I'd been led to believe that this was a whole day event and had made my schedule with this in mind.It was very obvious that the first hiring manager had already made up his mind. He was a bit rude. He would ask questions and then try to interrupt me mid-sentence. When I didn't let him, he got upset. I don't remember his technical question, but it was absurd.The next two interviews were interesting, though the third of the day was entirely about solving a problem with no other questions asked. I thought them extremely pointless. The last interview was the one of the most interesting in my career. The manager was a fascinating man and spent his entire time asking me pointed questions in an attempt to see where I would fit in his organization. He explained what various teams did and made it clear that he didn't know where I would fit due to my skill set and experience--something I was wondering about myself. The questions helped me form my greatest skill in a different way, which I found very useful.All-in-all, I found the process frustrating, pointless and offensive. I failed to see how all but the last manager could determine anything. I found that the hiring staff and one hiring manager to be very unprofessional. Above all, they acted like I was dying to work there. I was made to feel like a cog in a wheel and had no doubt that is what it would be like to be a Microsoft employee (that may not be true, but is how I was made to feel.)To top it all off, despite reassurances otherwise, I wasn't told the results of my interview until I contacted the recruiter. His response was curt and entirely unhelpful.I should add that I've never been to the Seattle area and found that I didn't like it. The traffic, especially bad.",

I had an extensive background in working on webprogram management and product management, but they were looking for much more of atechnical background and formal PM methodology than I have or am interested in.After finishing three hours of interviews, the HR recruiter came in to my littleroom with a box lunch and said that I would not be continuing on in the processbecause I had received two \"No\" votes from the interviewers. (They type notes andvotes on you while you are being interviewed on some shared document) So I packed upand went home.The only really frustrating thing was that I think the HR recruiter should have beenable to understand that my background didn't match at all with what they werelooking for so the whole thing ended up being a lot of trouble for a waste of time.Also I would say that the job description did not match what they were looking forvery well either - however when I asked the recruiter a lot of questions during myphone interview, she didn't know and told me those were questions to ask at theinterview.

The first interview was with a colleague of the two hiring managers - this interview was great, in that we both talked business and got the opportunity for small talk and getting to know each other. I wish this first interviewer had been the hiring manager, because he was great to talk with and I learned a lot about the company, the culture, the team, and how they operate.The two hiring managers were both straight to business. Neither friendly nor unfriendly, they simply asked question after question after question. One hiring manager asked me \"how do you influence people who do not report to you? How do you get them to do things for you even if they want to or have to?\"That particular question through me for a loop, actually, because it's never come up in my previous 12 years of employment. By which I mean, I've never actually encountered someone who refused to do their job for no reason. My answer was clearly wrong, because the 4th interview was my final interview.

        "details": "I submitted my CV via a Microsoft presentation at my university and got a follow-up email a couple of weeks later.PHONE INTERVIEW:First part of the interview was by phone, and I actually interviewed for a Program Manager position. Initially, the questions were behavioral (i.e. What do you like about programming? What's a problem that you've solved? Illustrate a problem that was solved as a team). The PM technical questions that\u2026\u00a0 were asked were mostly logical reasoning (i.e. if you owned a custom shoe store, what questions would you ask the customer in order to ascertain their needs?).I was flown to Sydney about 6 months later for the 2nd round interviews which was for a SDET/SDE internship.1:1 INTERVIEWOverall, I interviewed with 4 people, roughly 45 mins each. In between interviews, whilst the interviewers discussed the candidates, we (a group of 5) were shown a presentation about Microsoft. Interviews consisted of a behavioural question (i.e. what's a programming project that you've done?) followed by 2-3 technical questions (i.e. given an array of negative and positive numbers, give an algorithm to find the sequence that gives the largest sum. What are some interfaces of a vending machine and how do they interact with each other?). It was concluded by a general 'is there anything you'd like to ask me?'. Prepare questions beforehand!After the 4 interviews, we were told results straightaway.TIPS:- Ask a lot of clarification questions, in order to narrow down the problem. It might help to repeat the question back to the interviewer.- Vocalize everything you do, even if it's something you don't plan on using (e.g. \"My first thought is to use an array, but although it has O(1) for retrieval, it can be inefficient as we don't know the number of elements and would potentially need to constantly re-size.\")- Admit you don't know something if you're stuck- Show that you're passionate about programming/working at MicrosoftOverall it was very positive, the interviewers were very helpful and genuine.",

        "details": "The hiring process began through LinkedIn. Initial contact was with a Microsoft FTE recruiter. We eventually had what I felt was a non-technical phone screen (though post being hired I know FTE recruiters take questions from the team for initial screening). About a week or so later I was asked to come onsite for an interview loop.The interview loop is a flexible one and fluctuates based on how you're doing.\u2026\u00a0 You always start with the recruiter. This interview is where your day's agenda is set. You'll be handed a sheet of paper with times and names. The morning interviews are the technical ones (and it's nearly unheard of not to make it to lunch).If you make it past lunch, you're normally doing pretty well. Some interviews in the afternoon may be marked \"As Appropriate\". In general, post lunch interviews are with your direct manager and a skip level manager (depending on the org, you might interview with the manager at that skipped level as well).Anyways, you normally interview with 3 folks before lunch, one during, and two after ... again depending on how you're doing.Interviews last 45 minutes. You should not expect your interviewer to always be on time --> this is a cultural thing at Microsoft. Most interviewers will be casually dressed. Again, it's a Microsoft/Pacific NW thing.In regards to technical depth in the technical interviews, you'll run the gamut. I found out after I was hired that I was, unbeknownst to me, interviewing for two positions while on campus, so my interviews encompassed two services. My interviews were technical and I definitely made use of a whiteboard in all of my morning interviews. The afternoon interviews were definitely a \"fit\" thing.In regards to an offer, I flew home immediately following my interview loop. The next day was right before a holiday weekend so I didn't expect to hear anything before Tuesday at the earliest. To my surprise, my recruiter called me with an offer, including relocation package, that Friday.",

I did try to make a point of this but it was useless. I pushed through the interview but couldn't get how I've been flown all across the world for a position for which I never claimed to have skills.The following day I interviewed for position 1, for the position for which I had 1:1 phone interviews with the hiring manager and for which I've applied. That went very good. I made an effort even though I was disappointed with the previous day. I later got positive feedback from these second set of interviews but I've been told the offer was not being made due to the negative feedback from the first set of interviews.Overall I didn't appreciate being asked questions so far from my domain of expertise, found it a waste of my time and evidently interviewers time.

        "details": "My first communications with Microsoft were during campus recruiting. I went to their events, but more so because I was interested in the company and their advice for me, not because I had my sights on an internship with them (though I ended up getting one anyway!) I was thrilled/shocked when I found out I had an on campus interview!To prepare, I bought a book called \"Cracking the Coding Interview\"\u2026\u00a0 (It's magical, I'm telling you. I highly recommend it). The day finally arrived!On Campus Interview: Half an hour long. Firstly, the interviewer had Windows 8 on a touchscreen computer, which he let me play with. I asked him some semi-informed questions (I had done a little bit of research on Windows 8 beforehand), which I think he appreciated (example: \"The design seems like it's made for a touchscreen, like you have here. Is it still good with a mouse?\").Next, he started with the famed questions! It wasn't hard (especially because I practiced binary tree traversal) - given a binary tree, multiply the value in each node by 2. Once I did that, there was the expected \"Ok, now test it\". I came up with several test cases, including seeing what would happen if the values were large enough to cause integer overflow once multiplied by two. He said he'd never heard that answer before, which I guarantee was the thing that got me to the second interview.The next question was an object-oriented design question that I had no idea what the answer was, so I was convinced I'd bombed my interview.The next day... I got an email inviting me to a second-round interview in Redmond! I was shocked/humbled/etc. About a month and a half later, I was off to Seattle, convinced that I was dreadfully underprepared.Second Round Interview: If you make it here, LEAVE THE HOTEL EARLY. I got so lost and was barely on time. First thing in the morning: Meet with recruiter. She informed me that I'd be interviewing with the Windows Phone team. (I've never touched a Windows phone, so I figured I was doomed, but it turns out that they're not interested with your experience with specific technologies!)Now, most candidates have a lunch interview, but my interviewer actually forgot to do that, so I was unlucky enough to have 4 (mostly) intense interviews on an empty stomach (he was very ashamed later!).-Interview 1: Hardest of them all, I thought. My interviewer was really intense (really smart - I respected him!) and asked me to implement a linked list. Also, basic object oriented principles-Interview 2: My interviewer found out that I like Project Euler, so he asked me a programming question based on that. Also, he wrote code on the board and asked me to find the bug.-Interview 3: One of the coolest guys I've ever met. He pretty much did a full-blown personality analysis on me (scarily accurate) within the first 5 minutes of meeting me. Then he asked me a brainteaser that I couldn't get the final answer to, but he seemed ok with that.-Interview 4: Finally a non-technical interview! It was with the manager, who told me that my interview was going great (not what I was thinking - so it was a relief!). We talked about life at Microsoft, etc, and then he sent me home.I waited for 2 days (that seemed like eons) to hear back from them. I wasn't confident, but I really wanted to know so that I could move on with my life. The recruiter responded with a short response to my thank you email that said Microsoft wanted to offer me the internship! She then called me to discuss the offer, and told me that the team wanted me to know that they interviewed several people for the position, but I was their top choice (which really REALLY shocked me!). I accepted!Final notes: Be enthusiastic. Prepare. Don't make yourself seem like all you do with your life is computers, but really, know a lot about coding. Ask intelligent questions (and clarifying questions!).I can't wait to start - good luck to you!",

        "details": "All started with handing out my resume at my university's carrier fair. MSFT's (Microsoft) rep was an SU Alumni and I had a recommendation which I guess helps a lot initially. We spoke about my projects, my interests, and how I like spending time, etc etc...I was shortlisted and an on-campus 1:1 interview was scheduled. This was a 30 to 45 minutes interview. Everyone were asked a programming question and\u2026\u00a0 a testing question. Both were pretty simple, coding question was to count the occurrences of every character in a given string. And the Testing question that I vaguely remember was to write test cases for a function that takes a string as input and does something. I was also asked to describe any scalability issue that I had faced in my previous projects.Then I was called for a final round of interviews to Seattle for an SDET position. On the day of the interview recruiter said I will be interviewing with Windows team. Thats a huge team and I could be interviewed by any team within it. But this already sounded exciting to me!1st interview was with a team lead from Kernel Team. He said he wanted to start my day with less rigorous coding question and asked me to write a function to return the nth Fibonacci number in the series, given integer n. I discussed my design choices before start the code, then wrote a first function where I used arrays, which was inefficient for a large input and then I discussed use of a liked list instead of arrays which wasn't any better with its memory foot print, then it flashed to me that I dont have to store the whole series and I just have to return what ever is required... He also asked for a recursive solution and asked to compare both solutions. Testing question was more of a learning for next rounds than the answers i gave. But learning is important.2nd round was with another team lead from Hyper-V team. Coding question was to rotate an image by 90 deg. Image is represented by a 2D int array. After bit of crumbling, I came to a solution. I was asked to device strategy to my own code. Again it was half learning from the interviewer and applying what I had learnt from earlier interviewer.3rd one was a lunch interview, so no coding question but lot of testing questions. Also he was expecting me to ask back as many questions.4th and final was with a manager. He asked a simple puzzle, a coding question to reverse a linked list using recursive technique. He also asked me about how other interviews went. Did a lot of talking here, not technical all the time, but about the day to day work at MSFT, about the team and what they are working on, etc.After couple hours, I heard from the recruiter that I did get through!",

The position needed to be filled quickly so the onsite interview was scheduled for the following week.On the day of the interview - I was scheduled for 4, one on one interviews (HR, dev manager, Sr. PM, and Group Manager). The first being the HR manager who asked typical HR questions. The second interview was with the development manager who focused on my technical background and had me solve a problem the team was actively working on. I then met with the hiring manager who I had previously spoken to. I answered a few design questions on the white board before heading to the cafeteria for lunch. My last scheduled interview was with the group manager who was very personable and wanted to know my work experience/background and wanted to know my reason for wanting to work with Microsoft. Near the end of the 60 minutes, the group manager looked at his email and let me know I had one more interview that day. He escorted me down to the reception area and I would meet with another person in 90 minutes. Turns out it was the Division Manager, I guess things were going well. After the interview, I was lead to the lobby and told I would hear from HR within 5-10 days.Overall, the team had a great dynamic and were very outgoing and encouraging. They were very eager to answer questions and tell me the great benefits of working with Microsoft.The HR manager called me back within 3 days and offered me the job.",

Although the email said I would have flexibility in scheduling, when I was contacted 5 days later, it was with a \"you're flying out this Thursday\" (they notified me of this Monday). Couldn't get it rescheduled, but hey, it's Microsoft. I flew out for their 2 day interviewing event for the Online Services Division, during which they comp you plane tickets, hotel for 2 nights, money for cabs, and stipends for meals. They take you out in a limo bus on the night before interviews to \"meet recruiters\", but overall that was pretty useless and you basically just start stressing out with all your fellow interviewees. The next day you have 3-5 45 minute interviews (each is 1:1). They're pretty difficult, but the nice thing is they give you your results (offer or no offer) right after you finish. Overall it's a stressful process, one which is unnecessarily drawn out. But the interviewers on site were overall pleasant people.

        "details": "My interview was for a MSIT SDE position, so my experience may have been somewhat different from interviews with product groups.I had my resume given to a recruiter by a classmate who was recently hired by Microsoft. I was given a phone interview in December, and on the phone was told that I would be contacted for an in-person interview at the Redmond Campus.I flew in on a Thursday, and\u2026\u00a0 Microsoft put on a meet-and-greet event for all of the candidates. Free food and open bar, plus a chance to get to meet current Microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. It was a lot of fun, and I think helps candidates relax and gain a bit of confidence before interview day.In January, I received information and scheduling for my on-site interview. Microsoft paid for my flight, hotel, food and other costs. In February I was informed the interview would consist of four 1 hour interviews, at the end of which I would find out whether or not I would be given an offer.I flew in on a Thursday, and Microsoft put on a meet-and-greet event for all of the candidates that evening. There was free food and open bar, plus a chance to get to meet current Microsoft employees and some of your potential interviewers. It was a lot of fun, and really helped me relax and gain a bit of confidence before the interview day. We were given packets that had our schedule for the next day, stating whether you would interview in the morning or afternoon group.**The Interview**We were shuttled to the Microsoft campus, where we had breakfast and a brief meeting with the recruiters before our first interview.First Interview:Met with a SDET who had been with Microsoft for over a decade, and had been a PM previously. Very friendly, asked mainly general questions about my experience, what I'm interested in, etc. Then, he asked me to design a subscription service system. After asking a few questions I found that he wanted the tech stack that I would build it on, with justifications for some of the choices. Overall, this interview went very well.Second Interview:I met with a PM who asked me some more general questions, asked me about a previous project I had worked with. No technical questions, and this interview also went quite well.Third Interview:Meeting with a SDET who asked me about past experience, how I got into software engineering (since I'm an MIS major). He then asked me how I would test the whiteboard, followed by how to test a piece of paper. Finally he asked me to write a method to remove all instances of a certain character from a string. He then modified it asking for how to remove a string of sequential characters from a string. The testing questions threw me a bit initially, but I still felt pretty good by the end of the interview.Fourth Interview:Met with an SDE who briefly asked me about my resume, then jumped into questions on OOP. Can you explain OOP to me. What is a class? What is an object? What is multiple inheritance and what are its drawbacks? Does C# or Java allow multiple inheritance? How is this problem solved? Finally she asked me to reverse a linked list, which I completely botched. I had seen it several times before, but just couldn't get the algorithm right. I didn't solve it before our time ran out, and had to leave it unfinished.At this point, I was feeling pretty nervous about my outcome. We were taken to lunch and when we returned, we were told our results would be given to us shortly. My name was called first, which I assumed meant the worst. The recruited told me, \"I hate to do this to you, but we want you to meet with one more member of the team.\" I had a final interview with another SDE, he was very direct and jumped right into the technical question. I was asked to write a method to find the max int in an unordered binary tree. I nailed this question, which I think got me the offer.I was later told that they sometimes ask for an additional interview to determine fit within the team, how true this is I don't know.I then returned to the lobby to wait a bit more to hear my results, and was finally called back and told I was getting an offer.Final Thoughts / AdviceThe process is pretty intense but also very enjoyable. If you can, make sure to attend the event the night before the interview. It helps you gain confidence, because you get to see them as normal people, not some sort of mythical geniuses. Plus, by being sociable, displaying interest and being excited about the opportunity, you can put yourself in a good position with potential interviewers. My surprise fifth interview was with a guy who I had a pretty good conversation with the night before and joked a bit with during the event.",

He said: \"I didn't waste my time on PhD!\"We had a lunch interview and he asked me how I would change the Email technology, I gave him IMHO some very good ideas about adding a \"subject recommender\" that helps in improving the subjects of email when we write them: discussed where, and how the suggestion should come from, how to present them, the benefits and so on. Without reasons he said that he doesn't like it.Technical: String modification (medium)Answered it quickly, asked me to code it, quickly wrote the code, went through it and optimized it.He said that I should have written the optimized code at the first time. I politely mentioned that people optimize their code. He said no here we want people who can write a perfect code on first try (as one of my friends says, that is the funniest thing to hear from someone at Microsoft that almost never has got anything working perfectly on their first try!).",

The recruiter informed me about what the plan for the day was and tried to get a better idea of what my interests were. Afterwards, I was shuttled to my first of four interviews. These interviews were more technically focused. Often the interviewer would tell me about the company and then ask a few problem solving questions for me to solve. I was able to ask questions to them near the end. The interviews took about 45 minutes each, and they were all with people in the same department I would be interning in. One was over lunch.Overall, the actual interviews weren't very stressful. The interviewers were easy to talk to and seemed very honest. It was easy to tell that they really liked working at Microsoft and tried their best to sell it. My day concluded with a return trip to the building where I met the recruiter and a wrap-up interview with my recruiter. Microsoft did give the option of staying an extra day to do some sight-seeing, but due to scheduling issues I was not able to do any.",

        "details": "Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my interview experience. It was unlike any other interview I had ever done. I was very impressed with the approachability, professionalism and knowledgeability of my interviewers, respective to their job roles.I arrived in the morning and immediately had my first of there 1:1 interviews. This interview was open ended in nature, the interviewer asked me broad, open ended questions about my career goals, strengths and interest\u2026\u00a0 to get a general sense of my \"inner workings\" as a person. We discussed the requirements of a sales role in great detail and I was asked how I would handle several \"real world\" sales situations. This interviewer was very open and honest about what the position entails and what was expected of potential hires.The second 1:1 interview was shorter and a little \"drier\" that the others. I got the impression that the interviewer was tired from flying in as he wasn't very engaging or enthusiastic. This threw me a little bit, as the previous interviewer was very upbeat and enjoyable to speak with. The interviewer for my second session was very direct, asking me specific, practical questions about my qualifications for the job. He also gave a very candid overview of the position, even outlining some \"cons\" instead of just \"pros\".My last 1:1 interview of the day was genuinely one of the best interviews I've ever had. My interviewer was so engaging and impressive that I felt compelled to keep in touch with him regardless of whether or not I received an offer. This particular interview was different in that the questions were borderline philosophical. We sent very little time talking about the actual position--instead, we had a conversation about my passions, goals in life, early childhood influences (yes!) and how a career at Microsoft fits into my overall life plan. I did receive one question that was a bit of a brain teaser--one of those \"if a train leaves the station at X time...\" questions, which in all honesty, did throw me off a bit because I was previously answering, broad, philosophical questions. I also learned more about the interviewer's role in the company which was not related to the position I was applying for, but honestly fascinating nonetheless. I cannot say enough good things about this particular interviewer; he even gave me candid feedback and insider \"tips\" at the end of my interview. He also encouraged me to keep in touch.Not long after my interview, I was actually surprised to receive an email from the recruiter saying that they had chosen to go with another candidate. What was interesting, however, was that immediately after the \"rejection\" email, I received another from the Microsoft liaison (not the 3rd party recruiter) saying that I was a \"very strong\" candidate, that they were \"impressed with my interview\" and that they desired for me to interview for another position in Seattle where I might be a better fit. Although I was grateful for the offer to interview a second time, I declined because I chose to accept an offer with another company I was dealing with that I honestly believed would be the best for me at this point in my career. All in all, I had a very positive experience with Microsoft and I would absolutely interview with the company again in the future.",

Also a very interesting question on how to test a map where he gave me an upside down map and we had a discussion on whether it was valid (it was an Australian classroom map, and valid.)Fifth interviewer was the test manager, and we had a great time classifying test cases for testing the find function on notepad.

Hotel, rental car, plane ticket. The first day you're there, you are able to explore Seattle. You are also invited to a recruiting event where they rented out a bowling place with OPEN BAR for\u2026\u00a0 the applicants to relax and get to know their recruiters. The applicant pool there was quite intimidating. Everyone is from the top engineering schools in the US. MIT, Stanford, UChicago, Maryland, UCLA Berkley, GA Tech just to name a few. And here I am from the University of Florida(lol). I was able to meet some program managers and talk to them about what they do.The next morning we were swept away in a MS shuttle into the interviewing room.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The interviews consisted of four 1:1 interviews for full time and intern positions. All of my interviews were very technical. My first interview was with a PCB designer for windows phone, and coincidentally my current internship consisted of me doing PCB design for high frequency applications. He asked me a lot of questions pertaining to my work, and will really make you think.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ironically, my second interviewer was a lead designer for PC hardware, which I talked to the night before at the intern event. We had a nice conversation, which then led into the technical question. It was primarily based on Microprocessor applications, and I was able to work it out even though I had dropped the class that semester.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My third interview was with the Lead Xbox Designer, who had about 20 years of experience under his belt. Really nice guy, but this time the interview didn't go as well. He asked me a lot about pcb design, signal integrity, and pcb design. I couldn't get the signal integrity question right, but he was able to help me work through it by applying easy to understand analogies and concepts. I felt pretty bad about this interview but kept my chin up.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My last interview was with another MS employee who was exceptionally bright in circuit design and programming. This guy grilled me so bad in circuit design. The interview consisted of two problems consisted of circuit analysis, and op amp transfer function derivation. I struggled a lot on these questions and felt that I bombed this last interview.\u00a0I was pretty depressed after the interview as I felt it went horrible. After all the interviews, we were told to hang out in the library and eat lunch while the interviewers deliberated. One by one, the full time applicants were pulled inside the office to be given their results. Finally, the interns were pulled one by one. I was pulled in last, and was not feeling so confident, because of the 12 applicants that were there, only one had been given a solid \"yes\". Two other applicants were given \"maybes\". I was the last one to be pulled in, and was extended an offer, which I accepted on the spot.P.S. - To be honest, I answered a lot of questions wrong. But it's important to voice how you work our your problems aloud and show them what you're thinking. Also, there was no lack of talent there in the applicant pool. But what I did notice was that some applicants were lacking social skills. I do not think that I had the most intellectual prowess of the group, but I believe that my prior work experience and social skills were able to boost my chances in the deliberation.",

        "details": "The process began when I gave my resume to a recruiter at our yearly engineering career fair (in October). She asked me a couple generic questions about my resume (\"tell me about this position\", \"what's something hard you encountered\") and why I wanted to work at MS. She took the resume and I got a call a week later about scheduling an on-campus interview.The on-campus interview occurred about a week\u2026\u00a0 after, in early November. This interview (and every interview after) had the format of: 5-10 min \"tell me about yourself/resume\", 30 min technical question, and the rest of the time \"do you have any questions for me?\" I felt like the interview went well and I was invited to an MS hiring event weekend in December for a day of interviews.When mid-December rolled around, I flew to Seattle and was put up in the Westin Bellevue. The first night, all software and hardware recruits (about 80 of us, for internships & full-time offers) were taken to an event at the Lucky Strike bowling alley where there was lots of good food, an open bar, and bowling. We also got a chance to talk to our recruiters and ask them any questions about the interview process.The next day, we had 4 interviews in a row. One group had interviews in the morning (8 - 12) and the others had theirs in the evening (1 - 5). We found out which group we were in the night before. In addition the morning group had lunch after the interviews and the late group had lunch before. Each group of interviewees met in the same room before the interviews (to eat lunch) and between them. Most people wore business casual attire. The schedule was: interview, 15 minute break, interview, 30 minute video about working at MS, interview, 15 minute break, interview. Interviewers would call us one at a time from the room before the interview, take us to a room to conduct the interview, and then take us back after. At the end of the day, we all went to the same building to play XBOX games and play with the MS surface. Then, our recruiters called us one-by-one to privately tell us if we received the offer or not.I'm glad I got the offer, but the recruiter first quizzed me on how I thought I did and if I had any other offers, and the strong points of my other offers, and how I would feel or what I would do if I did get an offer. I thought that was a little low, since it seemed like she was toying with me and I still didn't know if I had the offer or not at that point. Nonetheless, I was very happy once I got an offer and to hear the terms of the offer, too! I didn't accept on the spot, but my recruiter was hoping I would :PAfter that, we were taken home in shuttles and free to do what we wanted. I chose to stay an extra night instead of fly home right away and I hung out with some friends in the area. I flew back the next morning.In terms of preparation, I didn't do anything special besides reading the book Programming Interviews Exposed (2nd Ed.) and reading up on interview questions on this site and by Googling (or Binging ;) ). The more you prep, and the more introspective you are about your method of solving a problem, the better. In addition, it's really important to be charismatic and passionate about the position/group you're applying for and to be genuinely interested in finding out if the company is a good fit for you. As cheesy as it sounds, when you have that (and if you prepare ahead of time), then the right job offer will simply present itself.",

I was pleased to hear that I was selected to be flown up to Seattle and interview with the online services division (Bellevue, WA not Redmond). I will state early on that I completed the interview process and received no offer - however, with that said, I will be as objective as I can be about the experience.Firstly, understand that although Microsoft\u2026\u00a0 does every single thing possible to try to show how \"fun\" they are, by far the number one thing the interviewers look for is the ability to think and code just like any other large software company. Everyone who says that it's important to be social and personable at Microsoft must have interviewed with a different division. With online services, all that matters is coding, problem solving, and wanting to tackle new problems.During your day you will have four 45 minute interviews, with 15 minute breaks in between. After that you will hear immediately whether or not an offer will be extended. This is absolutely amazing by Microsoft. To have that feedback so instantaneously is incredible and truly first-class of the company. These interviews will be intimidating to say the least and I can virtually guarantee you that you will run into one or two people that you really like and think are cool, and one or two that make you second-guess if you really want to work there.Each interview has a coding question. My four were as follows:1) Given the in-order and preorder traversals of a binary tree, rebuild the tree.2) Given a sparse n-by-m matrix, find the number of distinct paths within that matrix (each cell can be off or on, find the number of distinct sets of connected cells).3) Given the Android 3x3 matrix lock screen, generate all the possible unlock combinations that one can enter.4) Given an array of integers, find all the unique elements.I botched the first question. It was 8AM in the morning when I attempted it and I had been up since 6:30. To be quite honest, I had forgotten to review the tree algorithms. I met with the interviewer and he literally bombarded me with questions. If you say *anything* be prepared to defend it and back it up. There is also a strong sense that you must be very, very interested in working for Microsoft. As one Microsoftie put it, \"the people who work at Microsoft choose to work there because they love Microsoft, it's not that they cannot work for Google or Apple\".There is little to no review of your resume. The emphasis is pretty much solely on your ability to code relatively generic, albeit challenging, programming problems. This can work to your advantage or it can be a disadvantage. To ace the interview, simply read a number of programming problems and study up on the division you are interested in. At one point in time, I was asked: \"if you were given a farm of 1000 computers, say, what problem would you try to solve?\". Find something that Microsoft is trying to solve, or some generic problem in the division for whom you are interviewing.As I was not extended the offer, I cannot precisely tell you what it takes to succeed in the interview. However, here are a couple of observations I made (some of which are listed earlier):1) Read up on the division for whom you are interviewing and understand their business well.2) Read up on many, many coding questions. If you read enough problems, chances are you will have heard a problem similar to the one you are trying to solve.3) I cannot stress this enough, but to succeed you *must* ace the first interview you have. I told you how I botched the first question. I did not think to use recursion. In a later interview I had a question that could have used recursion (implementing a BFS), but I chose the iterative process. The interviewer remarked to me, \"your first interviewer noted that you don't use recursion, why don't you?\". These interviewers talk to each other in between! As such, you must absolutely make a good first impression.If you can interview with Microsoft, it is a cool experience. You get two free nights in a nice hotel room and all your expenses paid. It makes for an awesome trip to Seattle. However, I really wish Microsoft would cut down on the number of people they bring to Seattle. Reading through Glassdoor, you will see *a lot* of people are not extended offers. Why bring these people if you don't extend a great deal of offers? I feel their current system unfairly generates a lot of false hopes.If you are interviewing with the big M, I wish you the best. You will have a fun experience and it will be really cool to even just walk through those doors once. As the guy who told me the sad end-of-day news put it, \"we receive 10,000 resumes a week, and the fact that you made it this far attests to your skills\". Be proud that you received the interview and enjoy your experience!",

        "details": "There were two stages for PM.First round was a 30 min on-campus interview which was very open-ended (ie design a better hospital information system and explain how you would roll it out to customers). It felt very short since the usual first round coding interviews I'd had were an hour, and Msft didn't ask me any coding questions.Second round was really fun, since Msft flew me up to Seattle for\u2026\u00a0 3 days and encouraged me to explore the city all at their expense. I had a full-day interview on the second day, which consisted of five people for about an hour or so each with a lunch break, which I had with my third interviewer.First, my recruiter met with me to explain the schedule for the day and revealed which team I'd be interviewing with (he also said that you only interview with one team, and that team decides whether they want you or not).Then I had my interviews, which included a wide variety of questions, such as:- feature/spec design (ie how would you design some status-sharing/link-sharing system and what features would it have)- business strategy (ie failure analysis of Msft Kin and what you would do differently without hindsight to avoid such failure)- engineering design (ie how would you design/change twitter to allow a user who wants to see language translations of his feed, and what if he uses a third-party twitter client on his phone)- people/customer questions (ie how would you resolve a hard conflict between you and a key engineer on your team, how would you juggle between competing customer demands, engineering constraints, time commitments, etc other dimensions)- technical questions (ie client/server questions re: PBX, spin-lock code)I enjoyed the interview questions for their variety and were a nice break from just algorithmic/coding questions like my other interviews. I also appreciated the technical questions, which removed my initial worry about losing a chance to solve engineering problems.The interviewers had a variety of backgrounds and always left about five minutes for me to ask them any questions, and the people on the team I interviewed with all seemed very cool.Between interviews, my previous interviewer would converse with my next interviewer for a minute to \"prep\" him/her, so I'm guessing that if your first three interviews go very well, by the fourth one your interviewer's impression of you has been compounded positively three times before even meeting you.By the fourth interviewer, I was getting a strong hint that they had already decided to give me an offer (since I was not done interviewing, I was surprised when they implied it), so when I heard back a week later it was more of a confirmation.Msft also put together a sight-seeing package and restaurant recommendations, all of which they either cover on-spot or reimburse you for later. This is great if location is a factor in your decision, as it was for me.Then the same recruiter worked with me as before to explain all the details of the offer, and there was very good communication (fast email responses, hour-long phone calls, etc).Overall an enjoyable experience!",

        "details": "I think this is well known, but it goes without saying that Microsoft's recruiting is top-notch. I missed turning in my resume at the career fair, and so I emailed the recruiter for my school. He promptly replied and told me to apply online and he'll follow up.I had a 30 minute interview on my college's campus for a full-time PM position. The person interviewing me was very friendly, making\u2026\u00a0 the interview pretty stress-free. I was asked two design questions. With any design question, make sure you first ask questions that help you define the problem. Then think of different types of people involved in this problem and figure out their pain points. Don't just jump straight into designing features. They want you to design from the users' point of view.The recruiter then asked me to talk about my past experiences and why I am interested in Microsoft. I told them what teams I was interested in (Xbox/Kinect/Windows Phone).I then received an email stating that I made the next round in Redmond. Microsoft was incredibly helpful in organizing my trip and replying to my emails very quickly.My interview in Redmond was a great experience. In this round, you are with a group of about 12 people. You go out to dinner as a group the night before, and then leave to interview together as well. This made the interview process less awkward, and it was nice to have people to talk to.The second round (and final) interviews consisted of four, 45 minute, interviews, with a 15 minute break in between. Some people received 2 rounds of technical questions. Luckily for me, I only had to answer design questions. I steered most of the conversations into explaining design decisions of my pet project from the summer.After the four interviews, everyone in my group waited to be called on to here if we received offers or not, while eating boxed lunches. I ended up receiving an offer, and the recruiter told me exactly what I would be working on. I lucked out, and got exactly what I wanted. This is the nice thing about Microsoft's recruiting: you know exactly what team you are interviewing for.I accepted the offer and am incredibly excited to start working at Microsoft.",

I wondered why I was not told these constraints originally but sent along new dates which I had to take off during my schools exam week (I was a little annoyed as my classmates who passed the first interview were told they would be interviewing during the next month when we were actually on break).After the dates were worked out, I was flown to Seattle and had four interviews over the course of the day. They asked me various design questions and I thought the process went great. Unfortunately, I was not offered a position. Nonetheless, the interview process was very streamlined. They paid for my meals, transportation, and lodging during the trip and the reimbursement process was very painless.

There were a couple dozen other people interviewing that day at the same time, though best I could tell everyone was interviewing with different groups within Microsoft. I interview with the Office group.As the position was a Program Manager, I got asked mainly design-related\u2026\u00a0 questions. I interviewed with four people: three managers and one PM. Whiteboards were provided to show my thought processes and work; the interviewers were more interested in hearing me work through the problem than if I reached the \"right\" solution, though I'm sure that's still important. Each interview was about an hour long, and there was a little downtime between them.I had issues (apparently) with seeing the big picture when designing a solution and had a tendency to get hung up on details that are unimportant during design.I was not offered a position at the end of it, though the experience was overall very positive. The whole process took about 6 hours, and was mentally exhausting.Some of the questions I was asked:1. Design a tablet app I would use in the kitchen.2. Describe the most complicated technical problem you've faced.3. Pick a piece of software with a UI problem, and how you would solve it.4. Describe in as much detail as possible what happens between when a user submits a URL to a web browser and that page is displayed.5. Design a GPS system for 16 year olds.",

        "details": "Within 2 days of submitting your resume to Microsoft you will be contacted by a Talent Sourcing Consultant. From the email address line it appears to be person from EASI LLC (Enterprise Alliance Systems, Inc).They require you to fill out a Self Rating Profile prior to speaking to the consultant.The consultant is efficient and professional. His mission is to quickly process you into the system and to very skillfully extract/deduce\u2026\u00a0 your salary information / salary expectations from you. A single noncommittal statement of acceptance to something the consultant says can immediately lead to you being considered for the same job but at a lower job title. Seeing what they did and how skillfully they did it led me to immediately purchase a salary negotiation book from Amazon.They do an excellent job of telling you what you can expect in the interview process as well as the engineering topics you will be questioned about during the phone interview.A couple days later you will receive a phone interview. The interviewer will immediately state the job title that they are interviewing you for (ie the lower job title) and whether that is acceptable to you. The interview won't continue unless you say yes.I was interviewing for a hardware position. I found the interviewer to have only a fraction of the knowledge and experience that I have. She had a list of questions which she asked. It's a good cross-section of questions. She would write a summary of each of my answers into her laptop. In addition to these questions, she would often ask about best practises, methodology and design techniques. She was trying to obtain as many of these as possible. Later, I found out why. Microsoft outsources their physical design work.At the end of the technical interview the engineer required that you discuss your salary expectations. I've never seen this before. Here was an engineer who could potentially be a co-worker and yet I was being required to discuss salary.IMO, the Microsoft candidate system is designed to obtain candidates at the lowest salary level. This makes sense since they are a mature company and their stock price has flatlined for the last 11 years. Their candidate system is not designed to identify and recruit top talent. (e.g. Google, Facebook, Apple)I found it distasteful how Microsoft engineers extract as many best practises, methodology and design techniques out of its interview candidates without offering anything in return. They are \"Takers\". There is no reciprocity.Overall, because of my experience I found the interview to be easy. Inexperienced engineers would have difficulty.",

The first interview was in college about 1 hour, one coding problem about sorting, just write the pseudo code in a paper, not so difficult, the pressure is timing. Then asked some questions about projects in my resume, and questions like how do you think to improve some Microsoft products like IE etc. Three weeks later I was informed they will fly me to Redmond for\u2026\u00a0 onsite interview.I flied from Florida and stayed at Seattle for two nights, Microsoft paid all the trip. The first night is a big dinner party with all other candidates over the country and Microsoft managers/employees who will interview us the next day. The dinner is not interview, just casual party with chatting, get familiar with each other, very friendly.At next day all candidates are divided into two groups, interviewed by morning and afternoon separately. I was in afternoon group, the morning is a bus tour for the Microsoft campus, meeting and talking with HR and engineers, introduced the Microsoft life, sports center, science center etc, they want you to like here, treated like we are one of them already. Actually the HR told us once you are on campus interview, that means basically you are qualified to Microsoft, but they only hire top half of us due to high competitiveness.Afternoon interview has 4 turns, about 1 hour each with different development manager. Each turn has coding question of course, write the pseudo code in white board. They are not very difficult, once you are in good hand in algorithm class, it should be OK, the timing and efficiency is the key.Remember I said they only hire top half of the group, solve as many coding questions as you can in one hour with better efficiency, then you will stand out to the top half. I worked OK to the first and second turn, the managers are friendly, and asked question like how do you think about Microsoft, any question/expectation to Microsoft/product etc.But I failed at third turn, my coding solution looks complicated and inefficient, although I worked out, the manager pointed that and introduced better one to me, of course that means mine is not that good. The fourth turn means nothing then, the interviewer not on the interview mood at all, just asked some unimportant coding/question to pass the time.So the result is obvious. All of us know the result right after the interview finished. They call the failed candidate one by one out of the room and told you very regretfully then you can leave. And the other half who still left in the room are offered...This is college hiring, all the candidates are undergraduate/graduate, the experienced one may be different and more difficult. Someone said since the 4 managers are from different team, if one or two are interested in you, then you may be hired, but by my experience that is not true, you have to pass by all 4 to get offer. The key is practice of coding problems consistently, from easy to hard, in short timing and good efficiency which make you competitive.",

Next interviewer, then another \"as needed\" or bye-bye. The 4th person you interview with will be your prospective manager's manager. If you make it that far, you're doing well. There's a 5th \"as needed\" person that will be your manager's manager's manager.I made it to the 4th interviewer, and was told that the 5th \"as needed\" person was booked solid and couldn't make it. This was a polite way of saying \"we'll call you\". The HR recruiter called me within the week to let me know that I was being marked as \"hire for MS, no hire for the position\" which means I'm not blackballed, just not going to get this specific job, so keep applying.Interviewers don't always focus on what your role will be. The position I applied for was supposedly a \"Service Engineering\" role, but 2 of my 4 interviewers were senior dev leads asking me a bunch of dev-related questions. \"Show me how you'd identify a problem with this service using C# or Powershell.\" Not just conceptual \"well I'd do this, and this and this\", but writing it out on a whiteboard in pseudo-code, how you would actually accomplish each task on systems you know next to nothing about and in environments with untold ambiguities. Clarifying questions are a MUST.My answers must not have been satisfactory, or perhaps required too much \"guiding\" (aka clarifying). It did not help that English was a second or third language for these two interviewers. When I gave puzzled looks because I had no clue what they just said, did they interpret that to mean I didn't understand the problem or didn't know how to solve it? These kinds of challenges will abound. Next time I will say clearly that I'm having a hard time with their accent (politely, of course).Microsoft doesn't do the \"if you were the size of a nickel and trapped in a blender....\" type questions any more unless you're applying in a group you probably don't want to join anyways.I'm rating my experience as Negative, not because I didn't get the position, but because the two devs that interviewed me for a non-dev role were added ad hoc to the interview in lieu of two people who were scheduled to interview me but were out \"sick\" (my interview took place the Monday after Thanksgiving weekend).Other than those factors (which I think tanked my chances significantly), it was positive overall.",

        "details": "My initial interview was on campus at Purdue University. I went to our CS department's career fair and submitted my resume at the Microsoft booth. I also submitted an online resume. I was contacted within a week and was set up for the first interview.The first interview was pretty standard from what I read online. Basic \"Tell me about yourself\", \"What would be your ideal job?\", What is it about\u2026\u00a0 Microsoft that makes you want to work for us\". Think about these type of questions BEFORE your interview. In my case, there were tons of things I could have said. I had narrowed them down and planned what I would say if I encountered such questions....There was one coding question, which consisted of some basic string manipulation in C. I did okay on that question...At the end of the interview when they ask you if you have any questions, MAKE SURE YOU DO! Asking intelligent and insightful questions shows that you are really interested in the job. If you can come up with original questions rather than \"So what do you do at Microsoft?\", you may really impress your interviewer!After the first interview, it was about a week until I heard back about my results. I made it to the 2nd round, and they were going to fly me out to Seattle. I had another offer from Booze Allen Hamilton, so they were very flexible and had me scheduled so I would have time to make a decision. I had about 3 weeks until I had to fly out to Seattle, so I started studying hardcore!When I had originally submitted for interviews, I had put that I wanted to interview for an SDEV position. I didn't really understand the PM role and all that encompassed it. However, feedback from the 1st interview suggested that I interview as a PM. After hearing that from my recruiter, I set out to find out as much about the PM job that I could find. After finding out that the PM role was exactly the type of role that fit my experiences and my career aspirations, I chose to interview for that position.Now I read somewhere online that \"You can study as much for Microsoft interviews as possible, but it won't help you out\". Whoever said this couldn't be farther from the truth. I studied as MUCH as I could. Here are a few references:The books: \"Oreillys The art of Program Management\", \"How to move Mount Fuji\", \"Headfirst Design Patterns\", \"Headfirst Object Analysis and Object Oriented Design\", \"Headfirst Software Development\"There are also tons of websites online that have great advice. Check out Microsoft jobs blogs for some posts from actual PM's that detail the job description and role characteristics. It really impresses interviewers when you can talk about the role and why you fit it perfectly!The 2nd round of interviews went really well. I started off at 10:00 am, and got back to the hotel around 5:30pm. Prepare for a long day! But also prepare for an exciting day! The interviewers were all friendly and genuinely interested in the work I'd done. Also, I couldn't have asked for a more energetic recruiter. I ended up having 4 interviews (Which I hear is usually a good sign). They were nice enough to get back with me about the results within two days! Very prompt! Overall it was a great experience, and I gladly accepted the offer! :)",

One of my colleague who work for MS had forwarded my resume to this opening. I was having a really nice job at one of the fortune 100 company and had solid experience with some 4 of the leading companies in the field. So my profile was\u2026\u00a0 good in that sense, but didnt see any mercy while doing 1:1 interviewing for the post. Initial phone interview asked about programming and testing questions. Not very difficult. Then followed by a one day interview which started at 10 am and lasted at around 5.30 pm. First one was one 1:1 hr session(just explained what I will be doing thru the day and what all i look from the job ) . Five 1:1 technical sessions , Initial ones where easy , but as soon as they realize that you are able to answer the initial rounds, the other ones will go tougher and tougher till you break.So you really dont have much idea of how you are doing, but it seems after four rounds you could be relatively safe since the questions are hard to crack questions by then and they also know about that. There is a lunch break that too filled with some technical and some personal talks. By evening you will get exhausted, so keep your energy levels really up till the end. They will give you indications about the result. The last person I met was a higher level manager and he told me ,that they liked me and that I had done well and HR will get back to you. After two days I got the offer. Dont go without enough preparation, for sure its difficult to crack without proper study , prepare well , at least it will give a nice experience .

        "details": "As this was my first big interview, my experience felt like a whirlwind.I was notified a week to the day before I was to interview at Microsoft's Redmond's Campus. I made it past the first on-campus interview two weeks prior. I was asked to implement a C function that searches a string within a source string( \"strstr()\" ). I didn't have much time to review, needless to say. I flew\u2026\u00a0 into Seattle a day before the interview. That night, there was an nice networking event where we got to meet with our recruiters and even talk with some of the interviewers.The interview process was pretty extensive. I had 4 interviews each 45 minutes long, with 15 minute breaks and between each. The questions ranged from implementing basic data structures on a white board (I was asked to make a Linked List) and some logic problems in my last interview. They even asked me the classic Fizz Buzz function to implement (Google it, or Bing it). I was also asked some basic relational database questions regarding foreign keys and primary keys. I felt like I was unprepared and consequently psyched myself out somewhat.After the interview, a reviewer will notify you if you have a job offer or not. They'll also go over how you did and what you could improve on your resume or skill set. They did a wonderful job and were incredibly professional about everything throughout the process.Here are some tips: Get some sleep. Try to relax during the interview. Don't over optimize your code until after you're done ( I did this on at least two occasions and overlooked some obvious things in my code because I was nervous). Be comfortable with writing at least 2 languages on a white board, one system (C), one object-oriented(Java, C++, C#). Review your database concepts too if you're familar with them. Finally, and most importantly, be yourself. They're more interested in how you think and approach a problem.Hope this helped some soon-to-be college graduates out there! Good Luck",

        "details": "This is an interview for a SDET position as a new college graduate (graduating May 2012).They started out with a phone interview, which consisted of a few (honestly pretty easy) questions. Nothing particularly technical, just stuff like:\u00a0- How would you test a calculator?\u00a0- If you were stuck inside a conference room with a window, but no network/wifi/smartphone, how would you figure out the temperature outside?\u00a0- Tell me about a difficult\u2026\u00a0 project you worked on.The phone interviewer was very friendly and it was a great experience. It went pretty well, and I was offered a flight out to Seattle.I'm going to take a quick detour here, for people who've never been flown out on a company's dime before. READ ALL OF YOUR EMAIL VERY CAREFULLY, fill out everything as soon as you get it. If you need to reschedule (due to an exam or something), then TELL THEM. They won't take it personally, they will be happy to work with you to find the date that best fits you. But be sure to tell them this as soon as you can.The on-site interview was very, very pleasant and I had a lot of fun with it. I was given 4 interviews of ~45 minutes each. My group started after lunch. Between interviews, we would have a 15 minute break to go grab a snack, get some coffee, use the restroom, or chat with some of the hiring managers.I had the following questions, one per interview:\u00a0- Given an array of integers (of any value, from MIN_INT to MAX_INT), how would you find the consecutive integers with the largest sum?\u00a0- Given a string, how would you determine if that string contains a palindrome?\u00a0- How would you search a string for a substring, in C? This guy also asked me some questions about hardware and security, such as \"describe how a buffer overflow attack works\".\u00a0- How would you count the NUMBER of palindromes in a string?Other people I was with had other interesting questions, the only one I remember right now is:\u00a0- Given a time of day, how would you determine the angle made by the hands of the clock?I didn't get a job offer (I really blew the non-coding portion of my 3rd interview, I needed more practice with hardware-related stuff, and I made a few really dumb mistakes when I was explaining stuff) but it was a great experience. All the free food and the free luxury hotel room certainly helped!One final note: Microsoft wants people who are smart, but also personable. Be friendly, be interesting, chat with your interviewers about their hobbies or interests, or at least chat about what they do. People skills are very important, and if you focus exclusively on the technical aspect of your interview and come off as a humorless robot, you are honestly not going to do well.Hope this helped, good luck!",

I went over the algorithm in my head and out loud, before writing any code. Then I wrote the simplest, naive code that I could think of.

Then, another 3 weeks of waiting before being invited to interview with the GM. The rest of the process was as I would have expected, but I was disappointed in the 30 minute final interview. The GM was completely unprepared, had not looked at my resume and had no meaningful questions to ask me. This was disappointing since I had had SO long to prepare and could have answered anything that came my way. When I followed up with Recruiting I was told it would take at least 2 weeks before I'd have an answer. Fortunately, the HIring Manager (whom I had worked with previously) set up a meeting with me the following week to let me know why they had gone with another candidate.

Three of those were with fairly senior people, one was with a more junior member of the team. My\u2026\u00a0 one case interview went poorly (on my part): I had been asked to prep for Marketing-style questions (\"what's the best marketed product,\" \"how would you improve X product,\" etc.), and the only question my case interviewer asked me was \"How would you price our product?\" The interviewer helped me narrow it down later, but didn't add much to clarify while I tried to think about all the different pricing issues with software products.

I had to walk towards each Office where the interviews were conducted.All interviewers were very cordial and gave me their full attention during the interview. I felt very well treated by them. The first interview was more about my personal preferences of communication, working environment and working style. The second interview was with a \"future\" peer that asked me technically questions aiming to verify my knowledge. The third and forth interviewers were with very Senior persons that talked about many things and I can't say what they were trying to check. My 5th interview in that day was with the hiring manager and it happened at 4 pm. At that time I was completely exhausted. The hiring manager was a fantastic character and he manage to make the interview very relaxed and enjoyable. At that time he already had received feedback from the other interviewers and he double checked some of my answers. He also asked me to say one or two sentences about each person I had the chance to talk with. He finished the interview with just 40 minutes rather than 1 hour. Initially, that bothered me because I concluded that I could be of no more interest to him. But, before I left his office he made clear that he was empathetic with my full day of interviews, with all the tension it generates and that I had showed to be a very good candidate, hence there were no need for prolonging the stress. He also told me to wait for 1 or 2 weeks while they would be interviewing two other candidates.The last interview happened about 2 weeks later and it was just 30 minutes.

That interview was just generic questions about my job, my experience, visa status etc. Then she emailed me that the hiring manager will be taking a phone interview as well. The Job description was vague and I asked her for more information, she said I should\u2026\u00a0 ask my hiring manager when he interviews me. With the being manager phone call he asked questions on APIs, more questions on my work ex etc. When I asked him more about the job description he said it is a generic PM role. He asked me technical questions nd I told him I am into coding and wouldn't like to pursue such profile either. He said that's fine, this position is not that technical. Then I was contacted by hr to set upa full day interview at the Msft campus. It took 3-4 days to set it up. On the day of the interview I first met the hr person who had contacted me. She told me how my interviews were set up for the day and if I had any questions. I had 3 intereviews set up and a 4th would be with the gpm if required. My first interview was with their dev lead, and he kept asking technical questions on hash logic etc - which was weird but I went with the flow. The next 2 were pm interviews with one being about generic pm questions - like how would you prioritize features, write specs etc. The second was more on their product. After that the hiring manager went out and came back saying I was done for the day and I would be contacted later.Couple of days later the hr contacted me saying that they wudnt be going ahead with me but would inform me if they had any other roles suitable for me. I was expecting that coz the nature of the interviews gave me an idea that it was a technical role which I had anyways informed them earlier I was neither qualified nor interested in such a role. What I was told in the phone interview and the role I was explained during the 1:1 inetrview seemed quite different.But overall the hr side of setting up things and responding was fairly smooth and quick.",

        "details": "The first step was applying online, after which point about 2 weeks passed before I was contacted by a recruiter requesting a first phone interview. The first contact via phone was with the recruiter herself, which lasted roughly a half hour and was very high-level, general interest and experience questions.After the initial interview via phone, I was contacted roughly one week later requesting a single phone interview with the hiring\u2026\u00a0 manager. The hiring manager phone interview was then scheduled about 1 week later, and in between the recruiter was quite adequate at contacting me and answering questions. The hiring manager phone interview was very much like the recruiter phone interview with some technical questions but more intensive and formal overall.I was contacted a couple days after the hiring manager phone interview with news that the team was interested in having me come in. The soonest available date was about 2 weeks out, so I had some time in between where I did not hear much from the team at Microsoft. Finally, I was sent a packet of information via email to fill out before the in-person interview, and was given instructions.The day of the interview was quite grueling. I met with 5 different people not including the recruiter, and each person seemed to test/focus on a different facet of my experience, skills, or personality. The first person I really clicked with: we talked over lunch about my experience, why I was interested in the role, and what I thought I could bring to the team. The second person was much more technical and asked specific task questions including abstract ideas and problem solving cases that might come up in the role I was applying for. This was the most difficult interviewer by far! The third person was a younger manager on the team, and he asked some experience questions and questions seeming to aim at personality traits as well as some technical questions - however, nowhere near as technical as the second person. The final person in the loop was brought in at the last minute and she was a senior manager on the same team. This person did not take notes or have a schedule to her interview, but asked difficult questions and was kind of 'cold' in general.Looking back, I am glad I had the experience to interview, but I do understand why I did not get the job. At Microsoft, it is not enough to be a fast learner, you really need to be able to hit the ground running and if you do not fit the role 100% you will not get an offer. I had probably a 90% fit and they did not want to waste time ramping me up on the final 10%.",

        "details": "I arrived in Redmond on a Monday evening, interviewed on Tuesday, and then flew out Wednesday afternoon. I drove a rental car about a half hour from the airport to the hotel. The hotel was less than 2 minutes away from the Microsoft campus. All of my expenses were reimbursed. Supposedly, I was given a sight-seeing allowance, but the only time I could visit Seattle would be after my interview.\u2026\u00a0 At that point, I was tired after the long interview and it was rush hour, and so I opted to rest and do work in the hotel. After about 10 days, I was contacted by the HR representative who I met during the interview and was told I was not picked for a position.The on-site interview process was strange. I arrived at a lobby designed for Microsoft candidates (there were many Microsoft gadgets available to play with, including a Microsoft Surface and an XBox with Kinect (which would be awkward to actually power on while waiting)). I took a complimentary water bottle to carry with me for the rest of the day. I didn't bring anything with me, but it might have been a good idea to bring a laptop so I could spend the waiting time before my first interviewer researching the group I was interviewing with (I was not told that group ahead of time; instead, I was told there might be many groups, and the interview time would be variable as different groups decided throughout the day to pencil me in for interview time). Everyone seemed a little surprised that the only thing I was carrying with me was a water bottle. I thought it was strange that other candidates came in jeans with a back pack... but apparently that was common.While in the lobby, I could interact with four or five other candidates. There were two rooms with glass doors inside the lobby where HR representatives did entry and exit interviews, and sometimes those interviews could be overheard from sitting anywhere in the lobby. That also seemed a little awkward.Before the interview, I was put in contact with multiple travel and HR representatives. There was a different person in charge of each stage of the process. I was finally told two days before I arrived who I would be meeting with, but when I arrived, I found out she was out sick. So I met with someone filling in with her. He told me that after my last interview (which he couldn't give me any information about), I would come back to the lobby and wait for him, but if I waited more than 15 or 20 minutes, I should feel free to just leave. He told me that either he or the original HR person would be in contact with me, but he wasn't sure who. Eventually, he did show up, gave me my exit interview, and contacted me 10 days later to tell me the results.During the interview, I wasn't given an agenda. I was hurried into a shuttle to take me to the building with my first interviewer. I sat in the lobby of that building for 15--30 minutes, and then I was met by my first interviewer. He took me upstairs to a conference room that he had a hard time finding because he hadn't ever been in it before. Once we found it, I was asked high-level questions about the difference between C, C++, and Java. I was then asked about the existence of certain data structures (singly and doubly linked lists, stacks, maps, etc.). I was given a high-level design problem for extracting data from text files using regular expressions and assembling that data into data structures. I was then hurried to my next interviewer, who asked me to write whiteboard code using C++ flattening specialized doubly linked list structures into pure doubly linked lists. I was then hurried to an interviewer with high-level questions about elevator algorithm design that ended up with coding on paper over lunch (i.e., I was asked to code and eat simultaneously, which was a little strange). I was then hurried to an interviewer who asked me to write C code for doing character processing (reverse letters in a word, then reverse words in a sentence). He also asked me how I thought the earlier interviews went and told me he hadn't read my resume. Finally, I was brought back down to that building's lobby where I picked up a shuttle back to the HR building. My HR rep arrived to meet me after 10 or 15 minutes of waiting. He gave me some tips about touring Seattle that evening (which I wasn't excited about due to rush hour starting), and I was sent on my way.",

Most of the talk over lunch was about the benefits of working for MS.Post lunch, I met with another Program Manager from my group who mostly asked about my thoughts on Agile and situations where I have used it.After that I was informed that I have another interview with hiring manager who mostly asked about my past experiences and situational questions. He had already talked to me over phone during the screening.He then took me to another person's office without informing me who he was. That person asked me my first puzzle question and cut me short 25% into my solution. Then informed me that he was the Group Manager - hiring manager reports to him. After that he mostly talked about how wonderful the company is and how great this team and its impact is on the world.That was the last interview for the day. He escorted me out and couple of days later I heard from the recruiter that they'll like to hire me and the negotiation process started.",

We talked about some of my experience and why I would like to choose to be a SDET. The question was how to find a difference in two arrays of integers. The second interview was the start of my screw up. I was asked to design a pig bank for coins and write the functions for a queue, like enqueue and dequeue. I didn't feel that well over this time because I thought my interviewer was always staring at me with his poke face, which made me very nervous. I also failed to find out one bug in my function in this time of interview. In my last interview, I spent my time with a very senior USB test software engineer. We talked about the Microsoft history and some of my project experience. I thought I was found that I was not that interested in testing at this moment.

        "details": "I had a phone interview with the college recruiter to whom I dropped my resume during Microsoft's career event on campus. She asked general questions about my background and why I wanted be a program manager. She then asked me to design a calculator. It's an open-ended question so be sure to first ask who this calculator would be designed for (scientists, children, students, etc). Be detailed and specific about\u2026\u00a0 the features and design and provide good justifications for each design choice. Second question asked for a \"fun\" or \"extra\" feature I would add to the design after the basic requirements were designed.Recruiter was prompt about my tight deadlines (already had 2 offers) and I managed to fly out within 2 weeks of phone interview. On site, I arrived at Building 11 Microsoft campus. I spoke with with another recruiter. She asked me what I was looking for in my position, if I knew what a program manager did and asked me if I had any questions.After the recruiter chat, I was sent off to my interviews. I had five of them. The first four interviews went very well. All interviews revolved around different issues a program manager would face. They were all drawn from actual issues that these particular interviewers faced. They were essentially design questions and they are looking for people who can anticipate all the technical hurdles and issues a design idea would have when implemented. Also, provide good justifications for every design choice you make.Fifth interview was technical and the interviewer was cranky and extremely rude (he didn't even introduce himself). He asked me to reverse each word in a string in C. I told him I wasn't comfortable in C and would do it in Java. He seemed irritated by this, but I went ahead anyway. I wrote it out, but as I was, he mentioned I couldn't use functions like tokenize, so I said I'll implement my own version of those functions later (despite the fact that the whiteboard was really small and really had no space). He didn't seem to be listening to my justifications for each line as I went along, so I kept having to repeat myself. It didn't seem like he cared what I was saying. There's ways to do it without tokenize, etc but I could have explained that to him after I finished my original method. Then he asked me a brain teaser which I didn't really do very well on and he said my method (which wouldn't work, but I was testing it out) was a \"dumb way\" to do it. All in all a terrible interview, but I felt OK as I had other offers and didn't feel like much was riding on Microsoft.After all five, I returned to the original recruiter I chatted with in the morning and told her about the fifth interviewer, who seemed apologetic about it and then was driven back to the hotel.",

I did all these things and a couple days later I got another email from the recruiter stating that they were going to setup a phone screen interview.After a few more email volleys, my phone\u2026\u00a0 screen interview was setup.The actual phone screen consisted of the following type of questions:(see questions below)Overall, I thought I aced this interview. Indeed I was right, because a week later, I was contacted by the Microsoft recruiter who said I would be flying out to Los Angeles to interview in person with a group working on Microsoft's newest SQL 2008R2 hardware solution.PS - Microsoft takes care of you when you travel. Geez! These guys paid for the flight, the rental car, and up to $75 bucks a day on incidentals. The hotel was 4.5 stars!! I got a room with king bed with a nice view. Awesome!The actual interview was interesting:I showed up in the lobby and was greeted by my first interviewer. He was very short with his speech to me. I felt a sense of arrogance about him and that he saw 500 of me a day (basically I was a nuisance that he had to deal with before he got to get back to his real work).We sat down in his office and he asked me a few questions about where I was from, how was the flight, and then he got up from his chair and erased some stuff on the whiteboard and proceeded to ask me the following 3 questions:(see brain teaser questions below)After answering the 3rd brain teaser question, this guy said that our time was up and so he took me back to the lobby where I and another person on his team went to lunch. At lunch the guy just let me ask questions about the job, the role I was interviewing for and the project that they were working on. After arriving back to the office from lunch, they sat me in a small conference room where I waited for 45 minutes before the next person to interview arrived.The next person asked me the following questions:1) Tell me about yourself in 2 minutes. I want an elevator pitch version of you.2) He then asked me to describe a project I had done while I worked at Cisco. He saw that on my resume, so he asked me to eleborate a bit on it.3) Next, he gives me a pen and asks me to walk to the whiteboard. I thought I was going to write code, but instead he tells me this:Pretend I am your best friend. Pretend also that I have A LOT of money, and that at times I have so much of it, I don't know what to do with it. I make my money by coming up with different investment ideas and my latest idea is \"parking structures.\" I have come up with this idea that parking structures in big cities aren't being run efficiently and that there was an opportunity to make some money in this market. I am asking you to take this idea of mine and come up with some ideas about how you could potentially research this hunch of mine, figure out what people really want when it comes to parking garages, what are some of the flaws in current parking structures that people don't like and design a parking structure that takes these flaws into consideration and eliminates them in its design.After drawing and writing on the board whilst sweating bullets for the next 30 minutes, he says that he is satisfied with my answer and asks me to ask him about any questions about the position.

The next logical step could be a resume review by the sales interviewers or hiring managers for external candidates and an informational interview for internal candidates.When a resume\u2026\u00a0 is found suitable the recruiting coordinator initiates the interview schedules by sending the resumes hiring manager or to a designated interviewer as agreed with the hiring manager. The recruiting coordinator usually is in phone conversation with the candidate to verify a good fit and interest in the position.On completion of at least 3 rounds of in-person interviews with the surround sales team, one technical and at least two sales personnel will interview the candidate individually. Based on a positive feedback which confirms the candidate's expertise in the skills and competencies as described in the job description, the recruiting coordinator typically schedules a in-person meeting with the hiring manager.The hiring manager reviews the feedback of the previous interviews, submitted electronically, and interviews the candidate to make a hire or no hire decision from a position and role perspective. He / She would also assess the candidate's fitment to the group, the specific assignment that the candidate is being interviewed for and provide recommendations. After the hiring manager has found a candidate suitable an \u201cAs Appropriate\u201d (AA) interviewer interviews the candidate for long term fitment to Microsoft.If the candidate is selected by the AA interviewer, he/she along with the hiring manager and the Senior Recruiter together discuss the specific details of the offer and start the offer process.On completion or termination of the interview loop when a candidate is hired or not hired the recruiting coordinator updates the feedback tracking tool with the final updates the offer details or dis-positioning details of the candidates and closes the interview process formally and sends appropriate communication to the candidate and other involved in the process.",

They do no have a good system for choosing interviewers, so you sometime get completely untrained people. Once, they even sent undergrad hires who'd worked at Microsoft for one year (these are 23 year olds with no prior work experience) to\u2026\u00a0 interview MBAs. This system has problems. They try to give interviewers a few questions to ask, but they're extremely high level and there are no suggestions for good or bad answers. Basically, getting through the first round is completely random.They then flew me out to Bellevue for the second round interview. The interviewers are the hiring managers. They each interview the candidates they were most interested in and then they kind of debate over who get whom. The mentality seems less to be that you need to be hired into Microsoft in general, but more like each individual manager is looking for his/her employee. Your strategy for getting through this round is to find one or two managers to who will want you the most rather than focusing on pleasing everyone. This is not an interview where you need everyone's approval to be hired into a group. Each manager is kind of out for themselves (although they do discuss and you can lose the job if one manager hates you while another manager loved you).",

Apparently Microsoft had fired many recruiters and just ramped up on recruiters earlier this year.Phone interview was standard discussion on programming languages, a question on how to test a phone, and a coding question on binary search trees. Straightforward stuff.2 weeks later was flown on site. Had 5 interviews including the recruiter/HR. Questions ranged from\u2026\u00a0 : find a string query in a string pattern, find the smallest integer repeated an odd number of times, remove characters from a string without using additional space, to testing questions such as test a vending machine and test a traffic system. The questions were not that challenging but the focus was on finding edge cases and bugs.The interviews were easy/average, especially when compared to SDE positions. Unfortunately it seems that the negative perception of the SDET position is true: I found that the recruiter and the lead were trying a little too hard to sell me on the SDET position by stating how it is considered the same level as the SDE and/or PM level and there is no difference in salary (if this were true then there is no need to state it during an interview). I blew through the questions with ease and they probably thought I wasnt a good fit even though I was interested in the position as the group was an exciting one to work for and I have and interest in both development and testing.",

        "details": "After submitting my resume, I got contacted for a phone interview (I don't live in the Redmond area). The phone interview was with an HR person and lasted about 45 minutes. There wer typical behavioral questions (tell me about a time when..), and also a few marketing questions about products that I thought were marketed well, how I would improve those products. There was also a question about designing an\u2026\u00a0 alarm clock for the blind.A few weeks later I received an email saying I made it through to the 2nd round. I went to the campus in Redmond as part of an interview day. There were 4 interviews scheduled for everyone participating in that day (all within the group I was applying for), each one lasting from 45 minutes to an hour with short few-minute breaks in between. All the interviewers were nice, but each interview was very different. They were all people that worked in the group that I was applying for (not HR).My first interview was behavioral (tell me about a time when...), and asked very typical questions about why I wanted to work at Microsoft. It was very conversational, and it felt more like we were just talking about my resume, my skills, and my interests, rather than a formal interview.The second interview was a case interview. My interviewer drew out a real Microsoft business problem on the white board and asked me questions about how I would approach the problem, what other information would I need, and what action I would recommend. After saying a few things, I got stuck, but my interviewer guided me along towards different areas to consider. In the end, there was something important that I had missed and my interviewer let me know what that was. There were also a few random questions like, describe a process to me as if I were a 7 year old child. I didn't think I did well in this interview, but it couldn't have been that bad because later I got the offer.The third interview was very focused on marketing (I was applying for a marketing position). I was asked about products that were marketed well and poorly. I think it was crucial to use a framework in answering this question (marketing mix), but again, the interview was very conversational, and my interviewer guided me in certain directions when I ran out of things to say about a certain product. There were also questions that tested creativity like, what are all the ways you could market ping pong balls if they could no longer be used for ping pong?My last interview was the least structured. My interviewer basically let me have the entire hour to ask any questions I had about Microsoft. The interviewers talk to each other after each interview, so maybe I had already gotten a \"Yes\" from the first 3? Even though I only had a few questions to start with, as we talked, it became conversational so I asked additional questions based off the ongoing conversation. I think this was to gauge my interest in Microsoft and show that I knew enough about it to ask intelligent questions.Some people in my group got called back for a 5th interview, and we all thought that a 5th interview meant that you did well (and only 4 interviews meant you were cut), but that turned out to be untrue, since I only had 4 interviews and I got an offer. To prep for the interviews, I would just prepare for business cases, marketing cases, research the company, research your group, and show your interest in technology and in Microsoft.",

It consisted of six 1:1 interviews, the first one being with your recruiter, which is just general and will point you to the first technical one.The first technical interviewer will be a manager and ask you some coding/tech questions, the second interview was the hardest asking about Big(O) speed, how to test different systems, just breathe and keep trying. The 3rd interview is a lunch one followed by a few coding questions on Linked lists. If you make it past the lunch interview you're doing well since they decide after the lunch whether to keep going or not.The 4th interview was more about co-op experience, how to test different things, how did I figure out how to avoid SQL injections and how to find them.Final interview will be with the most senior person, in my cause it was a systems architect, he will ask a few coding questions and more about your experience and why you want to work as an SDET or at Microsoft in general.

On the day of my interview, I met with a recruiter who briefed me on my schedule for the day.I had 2 morning interviews with PMs, which consisted of open-ended design questions, like how would you design a sprinkler system or a catering website. They want to know your thought process and how you come to certain decisions. If you get yourself stuck, they'll help you out.I had a lunch interview, which was behavioral, with questions on how to deal with a team that is divided on a security issue, what you would do if you made a wrong call on that issue, etc.I met with the hiring manager briefly in the afternoon. We chatted mostly about my computer science curriculum. She was initially scheduled as my last interview, but decided to have me meet with one of her senior devs. This was another design interview, but more closely related to the work they were doing. Mostly questions regarding information that you could infer from someone's Facebook profile.Finally, I met up with my recruiter again to wrap up.

My school recruiter suggested that I re-apply immediately into the \"Explore Internship Program\" which is a special program only for college freshman and sophomores. Aside from that, it also differs from a regular internship in that you will be trying out all three roles (SDE, SDET, PM) in the\u2026\u00a0 3 month period instead of just doing one role for the 12 weeks.I got a phone screen and got invited to Washington for final round interviews. I did very well and got an offer. The people were incredibly nice...everyone from HR (they really try to get you comfortable for the interview) to the actual interviewers to random people in the office. Very, very welcoming and friendly.Keep in mind that since this is a program intended for freshmen and sophomores, the coding questions are much, MUCH easier than what you'd expect in a full time interview. However, I'd say the \"design\" questions (customer focus for PM role etc.) were about the same.Also, the interviewers look for enthusiasm both about software AND Microsoft itself. Even if you get all the questions right but you don't show passion, you probably won't get an offer. Fortunately passion is pretty hard to fake properly so there's no need to practice for it. If you're passionate it'll come out naturally, and if you aren't...then well...try your best anyways!",

        "details": "The interview process at Microsoft was probably the most positive and comfortable/ stress-free interviewing environment that I've been through. Everyone I spoke with was super-nice, open-minded, and quite positive. Here's the process that I have gone through:1) 2-3 weeks after I submitted my resume through Microsoft Careers website, a recruiter reached out to me and we had a 30 minute conversation, where I talked through my \"story\". The recruiter also\u2026\u00a0 probed a bit on my quant. skills, but we didn't go into details.2) After another 7-10 days, I had another 30-minute phone interview with the director of the unit for which I was interviewing. Again, the dialogue consisted mostly of me going through my background and the director asking clarifying questions to gauge my interest in the job, drivers, motivations, etc. No quant-heavy questions at this time.3) Because of Christmas/ New Year break, the turnaround was a bit slow after the second call, but in the first or second week of January, I got a call from the recruiter saying they wanted me to come in for the full interview day. A separate person then contacted me with very detailed logistical instructions for the interview day.The interview day for me consisted of meeting pretty much every member of the unit (5-6 interviews total). It was a bit exhausting, but they were very nice and treated me to lunch even. The Microsoft cafeteria is very much like a college campus cafeteria, which made the whole lunch experience pretty laid back (except that I felt a bit awkward wearing business formal while everyone else around me seemed to be wearing torn jeans and hoodies).The interviews focused on both my background as well as on my understanding of the overall landscape/ trends in the major market where this unit is active. We talked at length about the various players, the way that their activity might impact Microsoft, and its competitive position. I had to specific questions such as, \"how does facebook affect what we are trying to do here?\".4) The decision was communicated to me informally less than 24 hours after the interview day, but the final, formal offer was extended after a week (during which the recruiters did their job of poking around and asking questions of some of the references that I provided).",

        "details": "I attended a first round interview at my university in Seattle, WA, and then visited the Redmond, WA campus for an all-day interview for my second round.The first interview took a half hour, and was a one-on-one interview between me and an interviewer. He started by asking me a few questions about my resume, like what my favorite class was, and the project I was working on. We also talked\u2026\u00a0 about what kind of development I liked, why I wanted to work at Microsoft, why I wanted to be a PM. Then he asked me a technical question (see questions). He was very nice, and did a great job of giving me feedback about the type of answers he was looking for. I was actually the last interview of the day, so at the end he asked if I would like to stay and answer a quick logic problem while he packed up. I agreed and he asked me a problem about 3 prisoners wearing either black or white hats.The recruiter actually took a very long time to get back to me about scheduling my second interview (this time period also fell over winter vacation, so I think that was part of the problem).I arrived at the Redmond campus for my second round interview. I briefly met with a recruiter to talk about the day, and then I took a (single-person Prius) shuttle to one of the MS buildings in Redmond, where I interviewed with 4 people. The first 2 were PMs on the team I was interviewing for a position with, the third worked to supply data to the team, and the fourth was the first two PMs' boss on the team.The first PM asked me about my resume again. Then we talked about a project I was working on and what features I was thinking about adding to it (I drew some pictures on the white board for this). Then he asked me a coding problem: given a palindrome, ex \"A man, a canal, panama\" and a list of punctuation to ignore when processing the string, ex \", \" return true/false if the string is a palindrome. I wrote this in the language of my choice (Java, which he let me use even though he worked in C). Then we discussed the answer to, but not coded, a question: given a strictly-increasing list that has been shifted, return the number of shiftsOriginal list:, 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6Shift of 1: 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 1Shift of 2: 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 1, 3Shift of 3: 4, 5, 6, 6, 1, 3, 3The second interviewer asked me a bunch of PM type questions: if you were designing a web music store, what would you do? What things do you need to consider? What actions might a user make (buying music, searching music, creating an account) that need to be considered, etc).The third interview was over lunch, so it was more relaxed. We talked about why I like technology, why I want to be a PM, why I think Microsoft is cool, etc.The fourth interviewer was terrible, he asked me a ridiculously vague PM question about designing a mobile application to drive traffic to Bing.com. The question was really unclear; I had absolutely no idea what he wanted me to say, and when I asked him to clarify he basically looked at me like I was stupid because it was CLEARLY obvious, and said exactly the same thing he had before. I guessed what he wanted and made something up, and I don't think it was the direction he wanted me to go, but it was hard to tell because he didn't give me any kind of leading questions or statements. I think since he was the boss he rarely interviewed candidates.I finally took a shuttle back to my first building of the day, touched base with the recruiter I had talked to that morning, and went home.Overall (with the exception of the last guy) I felt like the interview went well, except that I realized somewhere during the day that I really wanted to do Software Development, not PM. I think my interviewer also realized I would be a terrible PM, so I did not receive an offer.",

I had mistakenly sent some additional particulars to another recruiter who just happened to be recruiting for this role.\u2026\u00a0 I guess luck was on my side. ;-) He (the recruiter) asked if I would be interested in this opportunity. And needless to say, things just went from there.

After that was cleared up, things went smoothly then-on.Anyway, so this is how the process went (for me at least):- Recruiter contacted me;- Recruiter filters candidates and runs a brief synopsis of a candidate's skill-sets, experiences, etc. with the hiring team;- If you get the green light, you progress to the next step;- Recruiter then set-up a brief 30 min telephone \"get to know\" with the recruiter himself;- Then the recruiter shares his notes with the members of the hiring team;- If you get the green light, you proceed to the next step;- Recruiter scheduled a brief 30-minute phone interview with a member of the hiring team;- If you get the green light, you advance to the next step;- Recruiter then scheduled another 30 min with another member of the hiring team; this chat was more intense (i.e. it was more akin to a courtroom cross-examination grilling session) that lasted for over an hour;- If you get the green light, you advance to the face-to-face round of interviews @ MSFT's corporate HQ in Redmond, WA;- Recruiter then calls you to deliver the somewhat good news that you're in for the face-to-face group interview rounds;- Someone else from MSFT then schedules your trip to Redmond;- MSFT treats you very well -- e.g. they fly you to Seattle, WA, house you at a 5-star Hilton hotel, that includes room service meals, and various other perks (e.g. .rental car, extra days to see around Seattle, WA, etc);- The full day of interviews was about four 1:1 interviews (a cozy room with a whiteboard, telephone, chocolates/candies, coffee/beverages, etc);- You then break for lunch (a delicious lunch is provided by MSFT);- Then I had had a group panel interview;- My last interview was with the hiring manager (GM/Vice-President), who was a really nice fellow just like everyone else that had interviewed me.- Recruiter then contacts you with feedback; and- An informal verbal offer was extended to be within a week, shortly followed by a formal offer, welcome package, etc.Overall, I will admit that the process was a bit nerve-wrecking and brutally intense, but also quite challenging and fun as well. If you are confident of your skill-sets, experiences, personality, and success abilities, then you should just do fine. One thing I will caution about is -- MSFT (culturally and historically) doesn't give much preference or credence to 'image' or those wildly elusive \u2018prestige\u2019 factors (e.g. school you went or where you worked). Well, they might, but it plays a very small part. I went to a top Ivy League school for my undergrad, law degree (JD), and business school (MBA), and all my career I worked at the top investment banks, consulting firms, and large cap F500 large tech companies, but during the interviews, it seemed as though that no one really cared much about those; they were way more interested in as to what I could deliver and how. I have interviewed with other large tech companies such as CSCO, GOOG, INTC, HPQ, ORCL, SAP, etc. and they seem to be hung up on all this prestige nonsense -- but MSFT plays a completely different ballgame. Also, I think I might have gotten a preference -- or even an edge -- over the other candidates simply because I spent the first half of my professional career in \"hands-on\" tech roles (such as engineering, application development, systems integration, implementation, etc). That said, however, it\u2019s all speculative conjecture on my part. Overall, if you can put on a great show and demonstrate to the team that you can shake-up the status quo, then will go far -- and they seem to like that very much so.Final note -- I\u2019ve had my share of disappointments, setbacks, rejections, denials, and my litany of turn-downs by companies was endless. In my opinion, the whole interview and candidate selection process is brutally arbitrary. Sad but true. But if you are persistent and have vested faith in your abilities, you can get that dream job of yours! Hey, if a self-admitted \"serial reject\" like me can do it, so can any of you! :-) Good luck to everyone!",

        "details": "My first interview was a 30 minute on-campus screen: one puzzle question and a few short, general CS questions. If you know anything at all, this is a piece of cake. The remainder of this review describes my on-site experience.Regarding travel arrangements: I experienced a flight cancellation for my return journey, but the travel team was very supportive and helpful, extending my hotel stay and rebooking my flight.Regarding the interviews:\u2026\u00a0 most of the advice and information available here and elsewhere online is quite accurate (just note that they generally do NOT ask \u201cmount Fuji\u201d questions anymore), and as there is a lot of it (if you are unable or too lazy to find it you certainly do not deserve an offer from any company) I will only give a brief outline of my experience.I arrived at the recruiting building in my rental car and managed to find a single open parking spot. After checking in at the desk, I had about 15 minutes to hang out in the lobby area with around 12 other candidates. They provide free drinks, xbox, and some weird machines running a program called something like \u201ctell us about yourself,\u201d which I tried to use unsuccessfully. The recruiter took me to an office where we spent about 15 minutes going over the day, some interview advice, and a little about my goals and background; nothing technical or difficult.The first 30 minutes of my first \u201creal\u201d interview consisted of discussing his and my background and me asking lots of questions about the product since I had never heard of it. The remaining 30 minutes were filled by a problem on sorting: design, complexity, and pseudocode. He had a somewhat similar background so we had no trouble connecting. Next was my lunch interview at a nearby cafeteria. There was a wide selection of reasonably priced food (though I had a voucher for a free lunch). I decided on a salad for ease of eating. We talked about the company, the team and my goals. Back in his office, I worked out two problems on trees coded up in C++. The next interview was entirely coding; two of the questions were easy but the third gave me trouble; it was the craziest recursion I\u2019ve ever seen. Make sure you practice with trees a lot, and don\u2019t bother much with general graphs. The interviewer gave me lots of tips, and I finished the code at the last minute. The fourth interview was more like the earlier ones; relatively informal conversation in the first half followed by a technical question, in this case design. I had to design a data structure to represent the state of a game. Pretty open ended\u2026 I think the idea is just to have a dialog about design tradeoffs (memory vs. speed and so on). Finally I was happy to make it to the last interview with an upper level person which involved more discussion of the team and my past experiences\u2014no technical questions. Be sure to have something to say about every item on your resume\u2014difficulties you encountered, what you learned, etc. I briefly met the recruiter again and went back to the hotel. In a few days, I heard the good news from the recruiter.So my advice is: 1) ask questions, be curious, and be enthusiastic about the team/product and the company. If you are having a \u201cconversation\u201c and not just a dry Q&A, then you are probably doing this well. 2) spend a few minutes verbalizing your ideas before writing any code. 3) don\u2019t code silently. 4) practice coding on paper or a whiteboard before the interview--preferably with someone watching over your shoulder. It really helps! 5) try to learn something from each interview, anything, then use it in a later interview; ESPECIALLY if the interviewer specifically gives you advice. They want you to succeed. Remember this if you get nervous.This is mostly drawn from advice I\u2019ve heard elsewhere, but I found it to be particularly useful. Good Luck! Also, everyone I encountered at Microsoft was very nice and personable. The interviews felt mostly relaxed and enjoyable.",

Again, seemed more like a 'get to know you' fit type of interview. He was very willing to answer my questions about the work they did in the team. He gave me some information on the role.Heard back from recruiter in 2-3 days and she set up another interview, this time with the hiring manager for another week down the line.More fit questions. A little more on my experience and some situational questions. The hiring manager gave me job information that was different to what I had got the first time. Nevertheless, it seemed to go well.Recruiter again got in touch within 2-3 days and said she would arrange a full interview loop - supposedly 4 interviews over 5 hours.I went in a week later for the in-person interviews. Ended up having 7 interviews over the entire day. The interview process was very disorganized. Half the people interviewing me didn't seem to know till that they were going to have to do so and didn't have my resume or know who I was and what role I was being considered for. Some of the interviewers were not even related to the team I was considering. All in all, a shambles.The interviews themselves were a mixture of fit, experience and case-study type questions. I was glad to have read up on the industry and knowing about the company. It was important to be able to relate my experience to the role because I don't have technology experience. One thing that was strange was that the hiring manager's manager gave me a third job description. So, it seemed like no one knew what they wanted this role to do. Not impressed!I didn't get an offer - the reason they gave was that they went with an internal candidate. So, that's that! Though I do wonder why they interviewed me if they had an internal candidate lined up?",

        "details": "You'll be assigned a recruiter that will deal with your on site interview setup. This person gives you further questions to assess where to place you for interviews, because you interview with the particular team you'll be working for if you take an offer. Based on my responses, I was switched from Windows PM interviews to Office PM ones.Day of the on site interview: You'll go to Microsoft's main campus\u2026\u00a0 and head to the recruiting building. There, you have time to play with some of the current products (they had an xbox set up for candidates), enjoy snacks, and mellow out about what's to come. Later on, your recruiter will come out and discuss how the day should go for you, giving you a list of three interviewers and start times for each interview. Additionally, you'll be given a voucher for both you and your 3rd interviewer to get lunch on campus. In between interviews, I was either left at a lounge or the building lobby while my interviewers discussed how I did in their sessions.My first interviewer of the day was sort of the trainer for the rest of my interviews. He gave me questions to solve and gave lots of feedback so I could learn from my mis-steps, and it was expected that I'd apply criticisms in my later interviews. He seemed a little crabby and made me slightly nervous for the rest of my day, but his feedback really helped out.Second interviewer: This was my first chance to show I could apply the material taught to me and gave me a chance to meet another employee/get another take on life at Microsoft. While walking to his office, he brought up how he was someone that used to say he'd never work at MS and now loves it. Very personable interviewer. He gave me some questions about my background and gave some incredibly open-ended questions, which let me approach problems from areas I knew a lot about. I was able to bring up things like musical instrument design to answer his questions. After my interview time was up, he gave me his card so I could contact him with any questions.Third/lunch interviewer: We did lunch in a cafeteria in the building (really good food, and incredibly vegetarian friendly) while we discussed our backgrounds. He was another extremely personable interviewer. We talked a lot about the benefits of working at MS while eating. After finishing, we went to his office to do the actual interview. Again, I was expected to apply what I learned in my prior interviews to questions that my interests drove. My interviewer saw that I have a space background, so I got space related design questions that were almost brainteasers.After my third interview, the interviewer told me I had additional interviews scheduled, so he took me back to the lobby to wait. My fourth interview of the day was with the person in charge of the team. Her interviewers were target audience focused, so I needed to ask a lot of questions to understand how to best design a product. I was told I had another interview, so we walked back to the lobby while she went to discuss her thoughts of me.For my final interview, for the first time, my technical background was also examined. I was given a design task to create a product for all ages, which was followed by a problem of encoding information as bits (I probably only got this question because my BS will be in computer science). I got through the questions, and the interviewer told me that everyone was impressed, and that I should expect to receive an offer. Following that, he gave me a product demo of what he worked on, and we got into a conversation about all the ways you could mess with the program. We ran about 20 minutes past the interview stop time discussing it. He walked me back to the lobby, telling me that I'd hear back very soon and calling for a car to take me back to the recruiting building.Last of the day: recruiter. He asked about my impressions of the interview process and if I had any concerns about taking an offer, should one be extended.Post interviews: The recruiter was in contact with me to answer any questions I had about the offer itself. Additionally, the employee that gave me his business card answered tons of questions I had about the area. I was even given a call by my fourth interviewer/future boss to make sure any questions I had about the role itself were answered. Additionally, MS was courting students from my school. Those of us with offers/still interviewing were taken out for a night on the company, and I've had multiple dinners with current employees to answer more questions.Additional interview notes: You will be expected to stand at a white board and sketch out design ideas. Also, verbalize any concerns you have. Do you need more information about the customer? Ask! Do you have ideas that might be solutions? Verbalize them. The interviewers want to know your thought process, and verbalizing can help them catch any misconceptions you may have about the problem.",

Because I was applying for the PM role, the questions were centered around how I manage my time, how I prioritize tasks, and how I have effectively managed a team in the past (and what I did right/wrong on that team). This screen took around 30 minutes and, at the end of it, I was told that I would be offered an on-campus interview.The\u2026\u00a0 on-campus interview was about a month later. I was scheduled for some interview event at first, but then they contacted me saying they had 'overbooked' the event and that I needed to reschedule. This was frustrating to say the least.The actual interview experience was excellent. I was treated better than I ever have been at an interview. I was flown from Ohio, treated to a nice hotel and rental car, and was given a food allowance that allowed me to eat basically whatever I wanted. I had the option of coming in early enough to explore Seattle, which I took eagerly.The interview day was a long one, characterized by a good amount of thumb-twiddling in between fairly relaxed interviews. I had a total of 4 1-hour interviews, although the last one was more of me getting convinced that I needed to accept the offer that was (although he never said it) clearly pending. Each interview focused on a different skillset. The first was about my design abilities. I had access to a whiteboard but never really needed it. The second was a lunch interview (I didn't have to actually interview during lunch, but I was escorted there by and sat with my interviewer) where I talked about how I would do the job of PM. It was all hypothetical situations, and the questions were open-ended. The thing that helped the most here was my prior knowledge of the PM role. My last interview was about projects I had undertaken on my own (outside of work and school) that I liked. Here, I got to talk about stuff that I couldn't fit on my resume, which was a lot of fun.The fourth interview, as I mentioned, wasn't really an interview at all, as it was clearly meant to be an opportunity for the hiring manager to convince me that Microsoft is great and that I wanted to work there. We talked about the cool things happening at MS and the department where this manager worked (the Live team). At the end, he hinted strongly that I would get an offer but that he couldn't officially extend the offer to me at that time.A few things I noticed about the culture and the people:The most important was how nerdy people *weren't*. I find myself to me a socialite, especially as techies go, so I was ready to feel overwhelmed by nerdiness. This was not the case, as everyone I talked to was polite and engaging, but also clearly brilliant.The offices were really cool. I only saw three buildings, but I saw no less than 3 ping pong tables, 6 refrigerators full of free beverages, and tons of aesthetically pleasing furniture and architecture. Most everyone was wearing jeans and a T-shirt, except the front-facing employees like receptionists.Overall, this was a great interview experience, easily my most enjoyable so far.On the difficulty rating: I found this interview to be difficult, but much of it stemmed from my jumpy nerves. If I had been able to keep a cool head, I would have found the process much easier.",

She then directed me to another recruiter who asked me if I would be interested for a position on the MSN team. I said I was interested, and a few days later, she set up a phone interview with the hiring manager.The phone\u2026\u00a0 interview was completely technical. I had to write code in a Live Meeting session. First I was asked to write some very basic HTML and CSS. Then I was asked to code up a problem that was recursive in nature. I struggled a little bit, but was able to come up with a solution in the end.A few days later, my recruiter told me that Microsoft wanted to fly me to Seattle for an on-site interview. A week later, I flew out for a day of interviewing. My interview consisted of three one-hour interviews, and one 1.5-hour interview that included lunch.My first interviewer had me code up a pretty standard problem on the whiteboard. As I coded it up, she asked me questions about what I was doing and how efficient my code was. My final code was not very efficient, but that turned out to be okay as she was just looking to see how I think. She also asked me to describe a time where I solved a hard coding problem on my own.My second interviewer had me design the classes that would be required for a CSS parser that would ultimately try to compress a CSS file by merging redundant selectors. Most of my time was spent designing the basic data structures and explaining how I would go about merging selectors. Again, he was just looking to see how I think.My third interview consisted of a one-hour lunch followed by a half-hour whiteboard coding session. The lunch portion was pretty casual where we mostly talked about what I've worked on in the past. The coding portion was pretty standard. I struggled a bit, but that turned out to be okay.I was told ahead of time that the fourth interview was contingent on how well the first three interviews went. So I was happy when I was told that I would have a fourth interview. The fourth and final interviewer was an old man who was higher up on the ladder. The interview was very laid back. He asked me questions like why I wanted to work at Microsoft, how long I intended to stay, and if I plan to pursue higher education. It was my impression that if you make it to the fourth interview, it's already been decided that you're technically capable of working at Microsoft. Now it was time to see if you had the right personality to work there.Two weeks later, my recruiter called me up with an offer.Overall, very positive experience. Every interviewer was very nice. They all tried to make me feel as comfortable as possible, giving me helpful hints when I started to struggle with a coding problem. They were definitely more interested in how you think than the final code that ends up on the whiteboard. Perfection is not required.",

When we started the interview he offered no apology.- about half of the interviewers did not review my resume before we started talkingIn general, the interviewers were unprepared and unprofessional, even arrogant.

To which she replied that Microsoft respects any good technology so just because they're competing, don't be afraid to talk about it.Tech Interviews:1. Write a function to list all prime numbers up to a maximum. Finished it in 15 minutes and then was asked to write test cases for it. I filled up one whiteboard.2. Non-coding - was asked to test a webpage with a single inputbox and a button.3. Remove a character from a string. Test it.4. Walk a binary tree, breadth first. Test it. (I ran out of time with this one)5. My as-appropriate asked me a technical question because i didn't do so well on my last question. He asked to merge two link lists. I answered it with no troubles.My As-appropriate walked me out and waited for a shuttle with me while telling me all the seattle spots to hit up.HR got back to me a few days later, gave me an offer and laid out the benefits of the job.Advice:The interviewers are interested in solving the problem, but they're very interested in \"how\" you solve the problem.

They had refused to give me any insight into the interview process, assuming that even if I didn't know what to expect, I should have no trouble discussing interfaces. Unfortunately, not everyone had this same veil, many came in having discussed the process with friends, before hand.I had no problems with the user needs and requirements gathering, but continuously got hung up on the actual user interface functionality.

Started at 8am, and it lasted through dinner (taken out by prospective manager) until about 9pm. The interview process was done in famous Microsoft style: the applicant visits various future colleagues in their offices, they ask questions to probe your intelligence, they make a decision, and when handing you off to the next interview, inform that interviewer of what they asked along with their initial impressions.There were no \"why are manhole covers round\" type of questions. Most were coding questions (boring & don't measure intelligence in my opinion), and there were a few math questions (probability & statistics).I observed that the work environment really depends on the team dynamics. Each group is a little fiefdom that competes with other groups.Of the 2 groups, I had no interest in joining one of them, and was very attracted to the other group. Unfortunately, the group that I wanted to be in deliberated, but decided not to extend an offer. The final process took 2 days. I had initial salary negotiations with the hiring agent: ballpark of 100K salary (I have a PhD) and up to 20K bonus per year...plus the fabulous Microsoft benefits package.In the end, I got a more family friendly (and more lucrative) job elsewhere.",

        "details": "This was for a marketing position so it does not necessarily apply to engineering interviews.Microsoft recruiting is a well-oiled machine. They are very efficient and have the process down to a science. The process starts off with a recruiter contacting you to arrange an informaitonal interview with the hiring manager. If that interview is successful (usually a phone interview), you're likely to follow-up with additional phone interviews. In some cases,\u2026\u00a0 you go directly to in-person interviews.Recruits will always be assigned a primary recruiter contact through which the interview schedule is arranged. The interview day starts off at the HR building where the candidate meets with the recruiter to review the schedule and answer any high-level benefits and compensation questions. About 30min.After that, the candidate will meet with at least 3 folks that will tackle a specific subject or set of subjects. In-between each interview, the team will meet to discuss progress and make any mid-course adjustments to find out more about the candidate. If the interviews are going well, the team will add other folks to the interview.General Observations and Advice:1 - This should go without saying; study-up on the specific solutions that you're targeting including any recent announcements by MS. You really need to know the solution area inclusive of competition, recent trends, etc. Be prepared to really show your passion.2 - Don't be shy about sharing opinions even if they are strong. Interviewers want to see individuality.3 - Be prepared to provide a ton of examples in a situation/approach/results format.4 - You will be asked questions that do not have obvious solutions (or a solution at all). Don't be afraid to ask questions and state assumptions. They want to see how you'd work a problem (and sometimes they're just fishing for a solution themselves!).Overall the atmosphere, the personalities, and the process was casual and relaxed but very energetic - if that sounds like a contradition, it's not.

Had a preliminary 'skills phone interview' (how long using x technology)...I was honest basically saying 15 years C++, but < 6 on the web and C# front.Was called in for a day interview. I was told I would meet with three people.After my third interview (lunch), I was taken to meet with two other people, then walked to the door.On the surface, the interview was more\u2026\u00a0 or less normal. These guys were experienced software developers who were some nice, some grumpy, some arrogrant, some sociable, some not. Normal.They ask me what I'm working on, some questions about my past, then I ask what they're working on, and then each interviewer asked a technical question, it seemed like because they knew they were supposed to because it's microsoft.The questions were hard, but it wasn't as nitpicky as I feared, and after working through the problems I felt like I came to reasonable solutions. But I didn't get an offer, so maybe they didn't feel the same? Honestly several of these problems I would have answered by classifying the algorithm, looking it up on wikipedia and coding.My last interview with the senior staff member was the worst. He didn't seem very interested in my answers. He asked if I wanted to change any of my answers to previous interviewers, as if somehow their were 'right' and 'wrong' answers, I guess. Sticking to who you are and what you do best is the wrong way? He asks if I have any questions, but then provides non answers to the ones I ask, so I say no, I can't think of any. I asked about work life balance and got the distinct impression that I was way out of bounds.Now that I think about it, I don't feel really good about the experience. Between all the emailing between interviews, the trading info, the puzzles, and the trick questions, it seemed more like trying out for a game show than a job. I believe this guys were reducing me to a zero or one (hire/no hire), and their questions were being taylored to make their decision. It was not about trying to understand who I am and what I could bring to the table. So I answer that I prefer references over pointers and I am a no hire? Immature at best.In that regard, a bad experience. Be prepared to be underestimated, under-respected and not seen. After putting it out there for this kind of experience you will inevitably end up feeling like a fool. Why do they use a process like this? One has to wonder about the experience working there if this is the recruitment setup.One guy intimated that they work pretty crazy hours there, so I suspect a big part of the interview was trying to find someone M$ could own. Not me I guess, though the technology was tempting. I would have tried it, I admit.The recruiter was on time with the no offer news (5 days), the best part about the interview (though I did enjoy talking to a couple of the guys).It worked out, I guess.",

She (the interviewer) was very nice and we discussed some basic program management questions focusing mainly on my past experience. It was a short 20 minute interview and ended well.A week later I was asked to come in for a full day interview. I got there around 8:30am and waited in Microsoft's\u2026\u00a0 very nice recruitment center. After a short while I was asked to come into a small side room where my recruiter (who was not the women I had been talking to via email, she had apparently been busy) asked me a few questions about my expectations and mood. She then explained the process and called a shuttle to take me to my first interview.I interviewed mainly with the Sharepoint team and started with a first interview which focused on asking me a series of design questions around hypothetical products. After I finished I was given a few pointered and we walked to the second round together. The second round was essentially a repeat of round one and I was again taken to round 3. In between round 2 and 3 I was told to wait in a lobby which took about 10 minutes. When my 3rd round interviewer came we went to her office and went over a few basic interest questions before going to lunch.For the lunch portion I was given a prepaid card for anything I wanted in the cafeteria. This was probably the worst portion for me since I was told before hand that I was supposed to ask questions that would get my interviewer talking so I had a chance to eat. I struggled to think of anything truly interesting and we spent alot of time awkwardly silent.After lunch the third interview ended just like the first and second and I was taken to a odd sitting area in front of the elevators to wait for the fourth. The fourth interview was the weakest most likely as I was exhausted by that point.After my interviews were over I was taken back to the recruitment center where the recruiter told me they would contact me by the following Tuesday. I waited until the following Wendnesday and contacted her to ask the results of my interview. She was slightly annoyed seeming that I was asking her but she responded and unfortunately told me that I was not going to be given an offer.",

My answer was to filter out special cases (empty string, null string, blank string, single character string...)

Interviewer's eyes rolled when I asked this and I was told to not worry about\u2026\u00a0 it, just code the answer.The actual coding was to be done on a whiteboard. My solution was to start from the end of the string and loop backwards. For each character compare the first index position against the last index position of the same character. If first and last index positions were the same the character was unique. Since I started from the end of the string the first time this happened was the last unique character. When that happened you dropped out of the loop and returned the answer.I was told that this was wrong. The way to do it was to run through the loop and hash the characters and keep track of the current last hash created. When you finished the loop the last hash created was the last unique character. We talked about the big O values of each methodOverall the interview was difficult. The interviewer gave the impression their time was being wasted right from the start.",

Another interview was scheduled.This interviewer was strongly biased towards SDE/T positions. He asked me why I applied for an SDE position and not SDE/T. I gave my explanation and was told the same could apply to SDET therefore I should really consider SDE/T. I said ok, but I like SDE (matter of personal choice really). After a lot of chatting about stuff like this we finally arrived at the technical questions. I was asked to return the longest palindrome in a given string. I was barely given 5 minutes (because most of the time was spent in explaining why SDET is kind of better as SDETs focus on code quality rather than just shipping a product). Further few minutes were given to test the code that I wrote.Btw, did I mention that I was supposed to write code in live meeting where there is no way you can edit the text you've typed? No indentation, nothing? (I couldn't figure it out, neither could my interviewer) After this, it took them over a month to reject me. The interviewer said 1-2 weeks.I was expecting so much from this.

I had the impression that there was hesitancy to hire an external candidate as the hiring manager discussed with me that the 2 most recent hires had been external and they were not getting up to speed quick enough after 3 months or so. I tried to allieviate these reservations by emphasizing my many years of experience, how I am a self-starter and come from a prior company with a complicated matrix organization that is in perpetual change mode, etc. Alas, they offered to an internal candidate although the recruiter indicated they really liked me and it was a 'tough decision' and that if they 'had 2 positions they would have hired me,' etc. I have been staying in touch with this recruiter and continue to apply to positions for which I am qualified.

        "details": "I was sent a schedule of three interviews. The first two would be one hour and the third would be 90 minutes, which included a lunch. He said that if the first three interviews went well, they would have me stay for two additional interviews. The recruiter said that they don't usually let candidates know about the other two interviews.#1:The interviewer was a lead-developer and very welcoming. He was extremely\u2026\u00a0 laid-back and low-pressure. He asked me the traditional \"what would you do if...\" and I was given plenty of time to have him answer my questions. The problem given to me was that of rebuilding a FAT table after it had been deleted. The interviewer drew some shapes to represent bytes of data and went through the problems setup before I started. I walked away from this interview thinking that if everyone I met was only half as cool as this guy, that Microsoft would definilty be the place for me. He was sharp, had great people skills, and sold me on the company.#2:The interviewer was a senior SDET. This is where things started going bad. He was definitely all business and was definietly a high strung type of personality (that's the impression I got from my hour with him). He gave me two problems. The first was to code the game Battleship and the second was to code a program that would return the least amount of coins, like the automated change machines you see in grocery stores. The program would accepts an array of denominations and an amount to dispense. So, for example, you would calculate the number of coins to give back for 67 cents, and the denominations could be anything, not just the traditional 25, 10, 5, and 1. He could ask for the change using coin denominations such as 12, 5, and three. The goal was to return the smallest number of coins. Well, he was a little condescending and mistook some of my relief when he changed the rules of the problem for cockiness. I explained to him that I was relieved that he had made the scenario easier, not that I thought it was necessarily easy, just easier. What really struck me as unprofessional though was the fact that he was chomping away on some snacks as I worked out the problems. He was chewing loud enough that the crunching of whatever he was eating was not only distracting, but said to me that he didn't take me seriously enough to just focus on me, he had to eat his food too. This is when I started to think ,maybe this isn't the place for me.#3:The interviewer was a lead SDET. We had lunch and talked. It's a little awkward to eat and try to talk, but it went well enough. Most of the interview was casual conversation with a few official business questions tossed into the mix. When we got back to the office, she had me solve a problem that consisted of building a funtion that would determine if one string was the substring of another. You were basically recreating the standard .NET substring function, but were not allowed to use any of the built-in framework functions that did the substring for you. She was great to talk with, and she too sold me on what a great company MS was to work for and had me thinking the same again. She was able to reverse the negative impression of the last interview.#4:Here's where it all fell apart. I don't know what this last guy's job title was, but \"jerk\" would be fitting enough. To start with, he honestly looked like he was about to fall asleep. There were severa; times where it looked like he dozed off and awoke as I started to respond to his question. He was extremely condescending, arrogant, and short with me. Even if my first three interviews had convinced me to work at MS, his interview was such a negative experience for me that I have scratched them from my companies that I want to work for in the future. The first problem he gave me I honestly can't remember. I just remember him finally giving out a sigh of frustration and telling me tersely, \"let's do another one since I basically did that one for you.\" The second was a traditional graph with an x and y axis. I was instructed to draw ten lines, the ten best lines for testing the graph. After that he changed the scenario a little, and I was told to add any lines needed to further test the graph considering the new conditions, but I would have to remove some of the existing lines, since I would only have ten. Well, at the end of this miserable experience, he told me that he was going to get my next interviewer. I was offer a drink and sat in the lounge for several minutes as he passed by a couple times. He then came over and said \"well, I guess that's it for today. Thanks.\"I left that day with mixed feelings about working for them. They decided that my people skills were great, but that my technical skills were lacking. I view it as dodging a bullet.",

When they finally set a date, it was past the deadlines of my other offers so I declined to interview. They then rescheduled the interview for later the same week. I had everything figured out only 4 days I was scheduled to interview.I interviewed with a team based in Beverly, MA. It was much more straightforward than I expected...no real brain teasers, with more behavioral types of questions. Then of course since I was interviewing for a PM, design questions. No coding at all, which was good because I was really worried about that.I only had 3 interviews, which worries me since I heard you have a full day of 5 interviews if they like you. But it was a smaller team/office, so maybe they didn't have 5 people to interview me. I did interview with senior level PMs. I have yet to hear back, but I'm assuming bad news.One thing I found is that Microsoft has a lot of resources to help you do well in the interviews. There was a candidate phone lead by one of the recruiters that I found incredibly helpful. I feel like if I really wanted this job, going into it I was happy with my other offers, I could have really studied more about what to expect.My overall interactions with the interview scheduler weren't the best. They were slow to get to me. Plus, the office I was going to was very confusing and large, so it was difficult for me to find Microsoft's office. I wish I had more straightforward directions.

For example, I had one interviewer ask me at the beginning of the interview if I had studied design patterns. I answered that while I had used some simple ones in the past, I have never formally studied them and thus don't know that many, nor the names of the ones I do know. Despite this, he continued to ask me questions for an hour about design patterns, and became visibly angry with me when I couldn't put names to the patterns he described. This probably boils down to typical engineer unsocial tendencies.The strangest part of the process is that you interview for a group within Microsoft that is chosen for you ahead of time without any of your own input. I ended up interviewing for a group that was doing work that did not interest me whatsoever, which made the process that much harder.",

After 3 weeks of not hearing anything, I received an email from MS Recruiter stating they were interested in my qualifications. A few days later, I had phonescreen with hiring manager, it lasted 30 min and went very well. Questions asked were 1) tell me about yourself, 2) why are you interested\u2026\u00a0 in this position, 3) what are your strengths. Then I was asked to come onsite.During this time, I prepared a lot for this interview. I knew of 3 people who works at MS and asked all about interviewing process; I had 30 min phone discussion with them and asked them lots of questions on what to expect during interview such as write on board, ask questions, smile & stay interested in the product and technology, et.c. I read the blogs on MS website on interviewing tips, that was helpful. I read a lot about the product for which I'm interviewing, even found MS contacts from one of the conferences I attended and interviewed them as well since they had experience with it.2 weeks after phonescreen, they flew me up to Redmond from San Diego and put me at hotel in Bellevue. It was a very nice experience -- paid for meals, lodging, transportation. I stayed 3 nights and 2 days: the day prior to interview, I toured the campus, Bellevue, and downtown Seattle. Recruiter called me and said I will talk to only 2 people, then get a break:Next day was the big day. I was greeted by a Group Program Manager and interviewed with him. He spent a lot of time talking about himself, the organization, and the role. He spent the last 10 min asking me only 2 questions: 1) describe a time you had dealing with someone who didn't collaborate, 2) business strategy on the product. Next person was Dev Mgr and took me to lunch (no interviewing, just chatting), then went back to his office for only 3 questions: 1) experience with product design & how I did it, 2) code leverage/borrow experience, 3) usability & user feedback experience.After this, they told me to take a break. This meant that if I failed, they would send me home. 20 min later, they brought a PM Lead, and my 3rd interview continued in her office. She asked 1) about my experience as a PM, 2) another design question, 3) how to improve the current product. Then she took me to the hiring manager's office, but this wasn't an interview, so we chatted, I asked about the job specifics & questioned him as a manager. Then he sent me home.I already felt I failed since only 3 people interviewed me, even though I felt good in all my answers. Next day, recruiter emailed me saying I didn't make it. When I asked for comments from team or reason for not selecting me, she didn't provide.Overall, my experience was good and they took care of me real well throughout the process. The questions were not difficult if you prepared, but perhaps I didn't take initiative to write on white board as often as I should. I believe they already made up their mind based on this or perhaps they didn't like some of my answers. They didn't ask me any brain teasers or puzzles. They key is to know your PM skills well and relate to questions they ask, and be as detailed as possible by using white board to help explain. Focus on product design experience, how to take in customer input/feedback to design, how to resolve disparate customer feedback, improvements in the product you are interviewing for, business strategy around the product (competition, opportunities, challenges, etc.). I believe my experience was more in fit not about your qualifications, so if you do well communicating, explaining, and show you're collaborating & listening, you'll be a good fit.The campus is amazing, there are lots of young people in their 20's, 30's, with many product groups. MS is huge, so perhaps I will try again as my experience here will help me next time.",

The third interview was a lunch interview. The guy seemed to be in a hurry because he asked me two easy coding questions before heading to lunch which made me more nervous. The forth interview was a higher level question about a 12 sided di and how many colors it took to color it. The last interview was with a tester who just asked a few 'get to know you' questions including why should I hire you. Overall a good experience.",

        "details": "After meeting one of the recruiters at a job fair on the east coast, I quickly secured a phone screen interview with two managers that went extremely well. They flew me across country out to Washington state for a face to face all day meeting. The time difference combined with a full day of interviews was draining to say the least. I interviewed with eight different people. Everything went fine\u2026\u00a0 until I interviewed with one guy who was also pegged to be my lunch date for the day. It seems that he was in some kind of political battle with the two managers that wanted to hire me. They warned me ahead of time that he may be difficult. The entire lunch was spent fielding technical questions...most of which were benign..and I began to feel that the job description i had been given wasn't the job being interviewed for. Went I returned, I had to wait in a meeting room while I was being \"discussed\". One thing you will note when you interview here, you will interview with a lot of people and after each interview they will leave you in a room while they talk about you. Also, during many interviews, the interviewer will instant message other interviewers and triangulate your answers with what you have told others. Its very distracting and unprofessional if you ask me. That's something they need to stop. I then met with the hiring manager who was red faced and stated that he had a heated conversation with the guy who took me to lunch. I then interviewed with a couple other people who's job it was to find out if I could be placed anywhere else. I didn't get a job. A few months later, I went thru the process again for another job. Again I had a phone screen that went well, two phone screens in fact. I noted that the manager I talked to seemed a bit down. I later found out he was being demoted. Anyway, they paid again to fly me across country, put me up in a hotel, give me a rental car, and keep me onsite for a day's worth of interviews. I didn't get hired this time either. The problem with microsoft is the culture...it doesn't fit with any other IT company I've worked for. Most employees are young and inexperienced, or have been with the company their entire lives. They have little or no knowledge of the IT industry in general or other technologies outside of microsoft. The project managers I met with didn't know anything that a project manager should, such as what a RFP is, SOW, PMP, etc. The technical guys only spoke in a microsoft context. They said they had worked with other technologies, such as linux, but in talking with them it was clear they had not. The worst was the job descriptions...they are unclear and don't represent what the job is really about, which is also a bit unclear. In the first set of interviews, I thought it was a senior engineer or architect position but it turned out to be nothing more than a 3rd tier technical support job for operations. Nothing I would really have been interested in. I also can't believe they spent so much money bringing me out twice and didn't do a better job of interviewing. The process is condescending to say the least. This is a dead behemoth of a company that still thinks its a startup and has something going on.",

You will spend the first week at work standing in line or running around campus to deal with HR and hiring requirements for badges, network access, server access.There is some sort of mock Zen environment in which asking questions in order to do a better job or improve quality will cause you to receive strange looks, derision, and generally asked to go away because you are not on the review checklist.",

I was told I would be hearing from them again.The next day the recruiter emailed me to setup an in person interview in Redmond, Washington. On the day of the interview I went to the wrong building and ended up barely making my interview time. Tip - arrive early!*Interviewer 1 - SDET: Soft questions about background, then jumped into a coding question. How would I reverse words in a paragraph of text. I coded it out and he pointed out a bug, which I fixed.*Interviewer 2 - Lead SDE: Jumped right into a coding question. There's a tree where in addition to the left/right pointers, there's another pointer set to NULL. I was to write a function to traverse the tree, initializing that pointer to the nodes sibling. So basically just connecting up the levels of the tree.*Interviewer 3 - Lead SDET: Print tree level by level. I coded up a solution in 10 minutes and ran some test cases through it. He then sold me on his team.*Interviewer 4 - Lead SDET: No coding question. The entire interview was me writing a test plan to test a robot.*Interviewer 5 - Development Manager: Some chit chat about resume, then a coding question. Print the count of letters in an array. So if the array was \"ababac\", I would print a - 3, b - 2, c - 1.After the interview the manager said I would hear from them soon. Next day I was given an offer, contingent on a background check.",

The recruiter had no idea how different the interview process would be compared to SDE position.\u2026\u00a0 As such i brushed up on my research more than the algo+data structure parts.On the day of the interview, I arrived early in the morning and went over simple hr type questions ie. why msft, why would i choose them over others etc. I was given the name of the my first interview and told that each interview would take me to the next one (depending on how well i did). Also the interviewers would discuss the area they covered in the interview and how i performed with the next interviewer (and have me sit in the lobby when the discussed this).The first interviewer was the dev lead and went over my resume, ask some questions about my projects then saw that i had TA for cryptography a while back at school, so asked me to design a card game online where the player cannot cheat. this was followed by a prob. question and to write code for it. After that he took me to the next interview. This person too was a senior member of the team. He asked another algo/coding question, which i barely managed to get done in the time we had. Next interview was lunch interview, this is 1.5 hrs compared to previous 1hr ones. He went in lot more detail about my research work and what they do. This was followed by a couple of simple coding question when we got back to his office, but i performed quite poorly there. After that he took me to the next interview, this started with a simple coding question which he made progressively harder till i was stuck. After i was done he said this was my last interview of the day and he accompanied my outside to the recruiting shuttle. He basically said even though this position involved research, coding part is more important, and i didn't perform as well. After i went back to the recruiting building, the recruiter wasn't there but had left a packet of info about Seattle (based on a survey i had to fill in before the interviews). After 2 days i got back a mail from the recruiter that there would be no offer.All the coding questions i was asked were standard and available on various ms/google questions site (which i didn't prepare as well on). Also just don't solve the questions there, think about all possible follow up questions, can you improve it space/time, would caching/ locality help, special cases (uniform distribution of numbers etc).",

        "details": "Did an \"informational\" interview with a team member (would be a peer) representing the hiring manager. Good fit, so we scheduled a full interview loop, which at Microsoft is a day-long series of 1:1 meetings followed by an \"as-appropriate\" meeting by the hiring manager's supervisor. In the Microsoft Learning group, you also do an hour-long presentation to show your skills as an instructor. Usually each interviewer is assigned to focus\u2026\u00a0 on one area (e.g. data analysis, people management), and this person passes along notes to the next interviewer to probe further into any area of suspected weakness. If any one person in day's series of interviews does not recommend hiring, the decision is usually a no-hire, but this is not always the case.In this instance, the presentation and all interviews went extremely well except one. Unfortunately, that interview was with a person equivalent to the hiring manager with whom the candidate would need to work closely. This person asked questions in a vague and puzzling manner so that it was extremely difficult to understand the actual question. To be clear, this was not an interview method; rather it was the interviewer's personality. One of the other interviewers actually described this person as strange and difficult to get along with, but with a good heart. In any case, this particular interview was so disasterous it was clear that the relationship would not be a good fit, and since I already had a job at the company there was not an incentive to \"fix\" the situation by pandering to the one person. If you find a person on the interview loop to be troublesome, it is a good idea to avoid joining the team. Better to work in a group where you are really a good fit. The lesson in this case is simply that, at Microsoft, you need to be successfully with every person on the interview loop, and you will most likely have 5-7, each lasting an hour.Having interviewed successfully at Microsoft and conducted many interviews for the company, I would say that the most important things to be prepared for are as follows:1. Be prepared to talk about examples of projects that can back up different points you might need to make: \"Here is a project where I needed to get things back on track,\" or \"Here is a project where there were personality conflicts,\" or \"Here is a project where I set goals for success, measured success, and made adjustments afterward.\" They want real-world examples of what you have done, not general discussions about what you might do.\"2. If you suspect that the interviewer is probing into a particular area, do not try to answer quickly and hope cover all areas of your expertise with this person. Most likely the interviewer has been asked to go deep on one area (either because it is that person's background or because this is a suspected area of your weakness). In this case, you'll want to take your time to answer thoughtfully. It is appropriate to ask questions yourself to learn how the group has done things in the past or what it's 5-year plan is.3. Metrics matter at Microsoft. It is better to measure something incorrectly but consistently than not to measure at all. Or as many people at Microsoft say, \"You should never do anything you can't measure.\" So think about different ways to measure success/efficacy at different levels (customer satisfaction, project cost, reach, click-through).Regarding compensation, this varies depending on the time of year, the recruiter, and the group. If it is nearing the end of the year they may be more generous with stock options (I was lucky in this regard for my first full-time job at Microsoft).",

I left completely demoralized.The interviewers were certainly nice, and Microsoft does a great job of making sure that you are comfortable. They paid for the flight, lodging, food, rental car, etc.When I arrived, I spoke w/ an HR representative who seemed distant and unengaged with our conversation.My second interview was odd in the sense that the discussion focused\u2026\u00a0 entirely on arcane aspects of SQL and some generic problem solving. That was fine, but then he posed a string interpolation problem on the whiteboard and asked me to write an algorithm...I am a-ok with problem solving, but I am one of the cerebral 'think it out' type of developers. Tossing ideas on a whiteboard isn't how I do things.... and I think the interviewer picked up on this. Ultimately, I came close to solving it, but I was feeling a bit pressured and out of my comfort zone.The third interview was with a very, very senior SDE who proceeded to grill me on c/c++, memory allocation, stack frames, register allocation, etc. While my resume reflected some commercial c/c++ experience, that was over 10 years ago.... since then I have focused almost entirely on java/.net and other languages. More importantly, the position I was interviewing for didn't require any c/c++ experience.The interviewer then chose to present a problem which involved the development of a 'move' algorithm for cribbage. This was another 'whiteboard' problem where given enough time, I could have solved it, but they really, really put the screws to you... and expect you to think on your feet... quickly.The last interview was a 'fluff' interview during lunch, and I could tell that the interviewer was just passing time. Another whiteboard problem followed where I had to develop a base-26 version of itoa(), which was simple enough.... but I messed up on a bit of syntax...The bottom line is that while I was certainly capable of solving any of the problems, the medium/platform they expect you to solve them is totally incompatible with my personal comfort zone.Am I smart enough to work at MS? Absolutely...I have over 20 years of industry experience using a variety of microsoft tools and platforms. I also have a proven track record of architecting, developing and delivering secure, high-volume websites and enterprise systems. This is no BS... I can do the job.However, there is a definite culture clash between MS and I.I have been told that other dev groups at MS are similar with their approach and style... which is why I will not be interviewing there anytime soon :)",

The interviewers included a wide variety of directors that I would be working with as well as one GM from another marketing org who was a stakeholder of the position with no reporting relationship. All of them asked mostly general interest, personality, and culture type questions as well as discussing their individual department strategies. The GM simply wanted to know how me switching from vendor to fte would affect him and said he had already given my recommendation prior to the interview. The hiring manager was really the only resource with a vision for how the role should function and he spent much of his interview communicating this (which was very helpful).Again, I feel my real \u201cinterview\u201d happened through my work and successes in the same department as a contractor. As this organization has a fairly significant contractor budget they very commonly take a \u201ctry before you buy\u201d approach where they hire contractors who demonstrate real capability. This also gave me excellent visibility in to the culture and work environment in advance so by the time I was hired on I already knew exactly what to expect, had no surprises at all, was fully ramped up, and had a ton of work from day one. Despite what I was told, the interview process felt more like a formality than anything else and I believe they altered the FTE position specifically so they could hire me into it.",

        "details": "I got my first interview by persistently approaching Microsoft at my university's career fairs. My first interview was a typical screening interview, but face-to-face on campus instead of the usual phone interview. I was asked open-ended questions, such as how I would design an alarm clock for a blind person and what my favorite computer application was and why.The next stage of the interview process was a fly-out to Microsoft's\u2026\u00a0 headquarters for a full day's worth of interviewing. All the travel and lodging was paid for by Microsoft and was organized very well. I had a recruiter at Microsoft who was in charge of planning my interviews, talking with the interviewers and making the final hire decision. He was a bit pushy, but I can't say that's representative of all Microsoft recruiters. I got to the recruiting building in the morning and met my recruiter face-to-face with a few other students who were also interviewing for internships. We were given the name of our first interviewer and a description of their group and then shuttled off to different buildings to meet them.All the interviews took place in the interviewer's day-to-day office, which was nice because I got a chance to see their normal work place and get a feel for the company culture. Microsoft is actually very laid back compared to what I had imagined. There are no cubicles, all of the full-time employees get their own office. The dress is very casual, and the normal dress seems to be a polo shirt or t-shirt and jeans. I decided to dress business casual that day (a collared shirt tucked into khakis) even though everyone had told me to wear a suit. Even then, two of my interviewers commented about how dressed up I was! The building I interviewed in had an XBox lounge (they bought a Wii too later that summer) and a kitchen stocked with free coffee and soda on each floor.My first two interviews were about an hour each and were pretty standard technical interviews. My third interview went a bit longer because we went out for lunch and talked casually (although this was still considered part of the interview). When we came back from lunch, I still had to answer a technical question before I set off for my fourth interview. My first three interviews were all with the same team and took place in the same building, but my fourth interview was with a different team.At the end of the day, I went back to the recruiting building and waited for the results of my last interview to come back to my recruiter. I did well enough that I got offers from both teams I had interviewed. Note that my recruiter said that it usually takes about a week to make a decision on hire or no-hire for an intern, so this was an exception. However, this actually wasn't all too helpful because they still only gave me one week to make a decision! My recruiter really pushed me to make a decision as soon as possible but didn't respond to my emails for the first half of the week (in his defense, he was sick), so I pushed my decision a bit longer than a week. I wish I had been given more time to interview with other companies, but I didn't push my decision any further and decided to accept the offer (after all, it was a pretty good offer).",

The interviewers converse and share comments about the interviews with each other through an online interview tool.\u2026\u00a0 Often times the candidate is made to wait as the next interviewer waits to see the comments from the previous person. If the person has anything negative to say, the loop may well be stopped at that time. Often without explanation. The guidelines specify a minimum of 5 one-hour interviews, but it is not uncommon to have as many as 10 people on the loop.

        "details": "msft has two rounds. 1st round is usually on-campus. Recruiters usually come to campus multiple times throughout the year. It's always not a big deal if you miss once - because they'll always come back again in a month or so.1st round is half an hour. Usually 5 min behavioral and the rest is tech. Depends on how fast you are and the actual recruiter, the number of questions being\u2026\u00a0 asked could range from 1 to 5.It takes about 1-3 weeks to hear from the recruiter about the result of the 1st round. Then they'll schedule an on-site interview with you. Usually you can choose four dates in the next coming month and they'll finalize one. They'll fly you to seattle (or other location you chose) and take care of all expense (hotel, transporation, meals etc).The on-site interview takes one-full day from around 8:15am to roughly 4pm. The actual length varies depends on your performance. Usually you'll be interviewing with two groups, one in the morning and one in the afternoon and there's a lunch interview in between. You'll meet 2-3 interviewers from each group. If you really screw up your morning interview there could be a chance that your afternoon interviews will be cancelled (they'll tell you your next interviewer is sick or something). You'll get an offer from the group only if all interviewers say yes and if one or more says no you won't get one. So that means you still have two chances (two groups).Each interview is 1on1 (95% of the time taking place in the interviewer's office) and takes about 1 hour. The interview consists of short behaviral questions and majority is about tech questions. You will be writing code on whiteboard. At the end of each interview, the interviewer will bring you to your next interviewer. They will exchange about questions already asked to you and your performance. If you make your way to see the dev manager in the end - the last interviewer, that means you are doing a decent job. If you don't even get to see the manager that means 99% likely you are already out.In the past it usually takes about 1 week after your on-site interview to hear about the result (could be longer if you don't get an offer). But now they expedite that to immediate result - you'll be asked to return to building 19 (it was optional in the past). And if your recruiter wants to see you that means you'll be hearing about an offer. And if you are told you can leave and wait for result, that possibly indicates a negative answer.Now they are experimenting new interview process which is more similar to Cisco's, which consists of 4 interviews which only take half a day, plus some site-seeing and presentations.The compensation is 80k (Software Development Engineer @ 89) base plus up to 20% bonus (realistically, less than 10%) plus stock options. Standard benefits - 401k, free insurance (health, dental, vision), ESPP and other misc stuff. It's lower b/c cost of living is a lot cheaper than bay area and the tax is a lot lower too. Relocation is 5k.You have 2 weeks to accept or decline the offer.",

Though there was not a match, I guess I will go anyway just because it was MS (plus I already had a job offer in hand without having to relocate)She asked my high level salary expectation range, I told her about my other offer and gave those rough numbers, she agreed it was within her range, and then asked to fly out to MS main campus for face-to-face interview in about 1 week as I had to join my other offer in 2 weeks. (then sent me email details how to book flight/hotel using Microsoft contact).Redmond Campus interview -4 individual meetings: (1st) with Senior recruiter (same lady who called last) - nothing technical, mostly HR type discussion, she said 3 technical interviews today, and a tentative 4th one with the department manager. Then off to (2nd) with Program manager - covered both technical and PM type questions in depth for about an hour, also had some \"IQ\" type questions totally unrelated to the subject matter - guy seemed generally happy with my answers. then off to (3rd) with Group Program manager - again technical, probing in to SQL/database/security side, guy seemed very happy with my answers. Next to the (4th) with a 2nd Group Program manager - discussion related to actually building a software product and bringing it to market - I had zero experience on this side, quickly evident to both of us that this role is not right fit. We both frankly talked about this not the right fit. He was doing email/IM in between, possible deciding on the 5th (tentative) interview with department manager.I was asked to wait in the lobby while the last guy checked with Department head. He came down and said unfortunately the Dept. Head had a dental appt. (or something lame like that) so could not meet with me today. (I had previously read other posts that this was a standard MS way to cut short a sequence of interviews if they felt in the middle that things were not going well)Heard back from Sr. recruiter a couple of days later this one did not work out, but she still thought there were a couple of other close matches and asked me if she can forward my resume to a few other group managers. Never heard back.Overall pleasant experience. My only thought at that time was that MS has so much money that even though I met only 1/3 criteria for this job, they just decided to fly me in. I am guessing that they flew in may be 5-6 other people with close enough matches and likely picked someone who met 3/3 criteria.",

For the second round, one guy sat with his back to me, and the other two gave me a drawing and told me that I needed to get the other guy to draw exactly what was in front of me. It was pretty tough (and they were still staring) but I did it. Everything but ONE triangle was exactly the same.Round three was two people, good cop and bad cop. THAT was tough. I thought I didn't get the job after that one. Bad cop asked me a 5 part essay question to which I replied, \"Um, could you repeat the question please?\" I was frantically trying to take notes so I could eek out an answer. Round four wasn't so bad, it was with my boss to be.In the end I got a great offer for an AMAZING job that really kick started my career in online media. I'll never forget that interview.:)",

        "details": "My engagement with the internal recruiter was very positive; she was organized and efficient in her communication with me - not always the case in Redmond. My engagement with the hiring manager was also very positive, and he appeared informed of my latest status each time we spoke. The interview loop went as expected except for one major twist - more on that later.I interviewed on phone with the recruiter,\u2026\u00a0 and then had a 1:1 interview with the hiring manager, followed by 4 interviews with other stakeholders in a loop 3 days later. The interviews were the standard mix one expects from Microsoft - probing on my business acumen in general and specific to the organization of Microsoft, some behavioral assessment, process mapping skills (I had to get up to the whiteboard and diagram a process flow in front of the interviewer as he questioned me), exploring my experience at Microsoft as a consultant, and brain-teaser questions to see how I handled difficult/ambiguous situations. It was all as expected, with a certain degree of aggressiveness, which is just the culture there. No surprises.However, one exception: one of the interviewers asked me to work offline over the weekend (my interview was late on a Friday) on a 'brochure' that would describe his team's funciton and potential value to its internal stakeholders. I thought I was misunderstanding him, so I asked some clarifying questions. Nope - I had heard him correctly: work over the weekend, and submit to him by 10am Monday a brochure. This totally sounded like an internal project he was behind on for which he saw the opportunity to use a candidate for some free labor. I thought perhaps he was assessing my ability to push back in the rough and tumble environment of Microsoft, so I pretty bluntly responded to him that I wasn't sure what his motive was. I stated that if he was trying to test my ability to push back, then an interview is a lousy test environment for that because I have no leverage as a candidate - which surely he could understand, and that it was very different from an environment between two employees. Further, that while I was willing to do whatever it took to help with my assessment as a candidate that this request seemed very disconnected to the role for which I was interviewing, and gently asked again if he could clarify how the end result would relate to my evaluation. He responded curtly that he was allowed to ask anything he felt was relevant, that he would withhold his evaluation until my deliverable was complete, and that the quality of my final work product would inform his assessment.I decided to play along, so asked him several clarifying questions for 10 minutes about the request and about the criteria for success against which the final product would be assesed - again, somewhat hoping that he'd see that as a strength and stop the madness. Nope - he left the room when I was done with questions and said he'd look forward to my e-mail with the draft brochure. Wow, I was stunned.After I left the interview with him, I called the hiring manager first (which he had asked me to do) and he asked how I felt the interview loop went. I shared with him the request made of me by the final interviewer. I stated that I was more than willing to complete that task if it was indeed part of the evaluation process, but that I was unsure if it truly was so. He apologized profusely, told me to ignore the request, and that it would not factor into the decision. I asked him to follow up with the interviewer directly himself to inform him that I would not be completing the additional 'task'.I was not offered the position - they were up-front in telling me that they were seeking someone with more experience in Six Sigma and asked if I would be willing to 'stay in consideration' while they assessed other candidates. I did that for a time, but eventually took another role with my own company, and withdrew myself from future consideration for this role.I still don't know if the whole 'brochure' task was truly part of the interview or not, but I can rest assured that I feel I did the right thing for me in the situation. While I believe that everything a candidate says or does during the assessment phase reflects on their fit for the role, I also believe there is a limit to what kind of requests an interviewer can make of a candidate. I feel like I responded in a way that was true to myself, and if that wasn't what they were seeking, then we're both better off having parted ways. But, it was truly one of the weirdest interviews I've ever had.",

Some thoughts for interviewing for marketing positions1) Passion. Absolutely mandatory to show passion for technology.\u2026\u00a0 Often it is less abotu absoute knowledge and more about passion and ability to ramp. Your first PC, what you like about your ipod, why smartphones will change the world, etc. Pick your story and use it during the interview. Become familar and direct questions back to where you are comforatble.2) Structured Thining. MSFT is a place of grayness often. It is up to you to figure things out. Having frameworks and strucuture to thinking is key. It will help you address unkown or new challenges - at work and in the interview process.3) Metrics. Like any big company, metrics are key. MSFT is just figuring this out relative to your big marketing companies like P&G. Show how you think about metrics - markeshare, revenue, new accounts, etc. Use metrics to show your past expereinces and projects",
