Instead, the whole process felt like an exam, and most interviewers behaved like examiners, not collaborators.There was very little discussion or debate. During\u2026\u00a0 4 coding rounds, the interviewers took a backseat right after they gave me the problem statement. After I was done coding, the interviewers examined my code and stated their objections to it, such as:- There's a wrong variable name that won't let your code compile- Please don't use your own utility functions, I've provided you with a few- Your code doesn't meet my contract exactly (I did implement an optimization, with the verbal agreement that the client didn't need the extra data)- In my system design round, I was asked to scale out a complicated data structure. I did make reasonable progress, but the interviewer and I were playing catch-up for the entire interviewTwo interviewers told me to implement a 'silly' protocol, or a 'silly' class.

Throughout the process the sourcer and the recruiter were extremely helpful in explaining what was next and what to expect.=====2) Video interview:A product sense and an execution interview. Both interviewers were very courteous.Execution #1 - The\u2026\u00a0 interviewer focusing on execution explained she would be interrupting me but that this wasn't something they usually did at Facebook. It's such a small thing but helped me be more relaxed about our interaction. I came out of the interview thinking I didn't do too well but received feedback after the fact from the recruiter that I had done well.Product Sense #1 - The interviewer who focused on product sense nodded and smiled from time to time. It was difficult for me to understand whether I had performed or not.=====3) On-site interview:I was in the interview process with other firms but coming on-site and meeting other product managers made it clear to me this was a great place to build product. Every PM who interviewed me with was sharp and interesting and I felt I had \"permission to not hold back\" which helped me give be clearer in my thinking and presentation.Execution #2 - We dived into Facebook live. The interviewer asked tangential questions to test both big picture thinking, goal-driven and detail focused execution.Product Sense #2 - This was such a fun interview. Letting go and thinking big and different is important (and fun) but it's also crucial to stick to a structure and go back to it.Leadership & Drive - The interview was a (great) conversation but I found it useful to present things in a structured way as it made it easier for my interviewer to follow.=====ADVICE:- Preparation books are useful but counter-productive after a first read and a pass on the exercises.- Use the books to create your own structure.- You've done the job and you know how to do it, now you just need to gather and organise your thoughts.- Blog about it as a way to reward yourself for the thinking process!",

In the initial call, he asked me basic questions\u2026\u00a0 about my previous job and why I wanted to join Facebook.Phone Interviews:As many have already mentioned, FB PM interviews fall into 3 categories: 1. Product Design (PD), 2. Product Sense (PS) and 3. Leadership&Drive (LD) interviews.My first phone interview was PD interview where the interviewer stated by asking which feature I was most proud of. Then he followed up with how would you improve that feature. Then he asked me how would I design FB for blind people. Lastly, he invited me to ask few questions of him.My second phone interview was PS. Here FB is trying to get a sense of how good you are at understanding metrics and making tradeoffs amongst different metrics. My first question was if you are the PM for FB Pages, then how would you decide what goals and roadmap to have 1 year out. Then the interviewer asked me how would I do it for 50 years out. He also asked me to go into some detail of why I chose the metrics that I chose and how would I improve them (roadmap part). Next, he asked me the following question: Let us say you are sitting with a mobile analyst whom you can ask any question. You are looking at DAU data across the world and notice that there has been a jump of 5% compared to yesterday in Indonesia. What would you ask the analyst? Lastly, I was given 15 min to ask questions.This interview lasted almost 70 min though it was supposed to be for 45 min.Both interviewers guided me / gave me hints when I got stuck or asked relevant questions for solving the problems given to me.After the phone interview, recruiter called up after 3-4 days to let me know that I have moved to onsite round. He also gave me feedback on what I did well on and what needed improvement to succeed in next round. This was super helpful as I focused my energies on addressing the areas for improvement.Onsite Interview:I had 3 onsite interviews, each 45 min long, starting at 10am. In each of the interviews, there was a shadow interviewer too, so in all, I met 6 people during the interviews. Shadow interviewers decision/vote does not count in the hiring process, I was told.First was PD, followed by LD and lastly PS.PD: What app FB should build next? How would you improve a FB app of your choice. I had a really good discussion with PM on all the questions.PS: I do not remember the details of this interview except that I did not do it so well.LD: This was behavioural interview with examples from my previous job. Here they are looking for how self aware you are, what is your leadership style, how do you handle failures and how good are you at accepting mistakes.After the interviews were over, another FB PM took me to lunch (while my interviewers met to discuss if they needed a 4th interview). Recruiter had told me that sometimes when they want to dig deeper into anything, they might schedule a 4th interview. The PM who took me to lunch had 4 interviews. Thankfully, I did not have 4th interview.All the interviewers were very courteous, down to earth and I had a very pleasant experience.Recruiter call me about 5 days later to let me know that I had the offer. He also gave me feedback on what went well and what didnt (PS).Focus on following:1. Tie everything back to FB's vision.2. Always start with goal and user personas, followed by defining needs/pain points and then feature design.3. I practiced/'solved' all the questions listed on glassdoor FB PM interviews, which helped me immensely. While almost all questions were new, but the pattern was same. The more you practice the questions the better you become at thinking on your feet during the interview and following the PM thought process without much stumbling.",

I was told that there's a lot of other candidates and all will be doing video so if I want to be considered I need to make it work.I made it work and informed them that I will be doing the video interview from my phone. Two minutes into my interview, a call came up on my screen, which I immediately ignored and apologized to the interviewer if there was any information I missed when the call came up. She replied that it was no problem and we happily moved on with the interview for another 28 minutes.Later that night I was told that Facebook passed and my interviewer mentioned that I took a phone call during my interview and that I was obviously distracted and had no prioritization.Overall a lack of professionalism and experience during the whole interview process. I did not feel like I was a priority to them and had any value. Seemed like the mindset was that they are Facebook, and if you really want to work for them you will work around them and their needs.

        "details": "Applied online! Got a call after 2 weeks from HR who introduced me to another recruiting HR. He setup a time for a brief discussion. Asked a few multiple choice questions.Your photo-sharing app displays a system notification when the user receives a photo. Your app should display the photo when the user taps the notification. Which of the following do you need to attach to the Notification object that you\u2026\u00a0 pass to NotificationManager?A. An Activity referenceB. A PendingIntentC. A BroadcastReceiverD.

Of those listed below, what is the BEST way to schedule these periodic checks?A. Register a WakeLock with PowerManager.B. Call setInexactRepeating on AlarmManager.C. Post to a Handler with postDelayed.D. Call setPeriodicTimer on TimerService.After I cleared that round, he setup a technical interview on the phone, which started with 1 Java question, 1 Android question and 2 coding questions which were to be done on coderpad. He didn't do introductions or anything which is mentioned on their website. The recruiter provided a link to a class with CTCI writer Gayle and also some training material. All coding questions were from Leetcode.After 2 days, the recruiter gave me feedback and asked for another phone interview as there were some areas that the interviewer thought he didn't have a \"signal\".The second phone interview was also the same but this time they were hard questions and I completed them before time and we had a small discussion about life at Facebook. The recruiter then called me after 2 days and said I crushed the interview and was asked to come onsite to Menlo Park, CA.Everything is paid by the company and you don't need to worry about anything except the flights getting delayed. I was late reaching the previous night before the interview and woke up early for the onsite.The onsite recruiter came on time and took me for a walk and asked some general questions about my preparations. Then he escorted me to a conference room and the interviews started coming one by one.1. 2 people (one interviewer and one observer): Background and personality quiz. Coding question found on leetcode.2. Android Engineering Manager: Design question on Facebook functionality.3. Android Engineering Manager: Coding question (From Leetcode)Lunch with an Android Engineer (told me that he has to submit feedback but it's just common talk).4. Android Security Engineer: Coding question with time complexity (From Leetcode)5. Android Engineering Manager (2 people-> one interviewer and one observer): Design question on Facebook functionlityRecruiter escorted me out and told me he will call me early next week. I got a call next week saying that the team is not going to move forward.Overall I think I struggled a bit with the white board questions but I was able to come up with naive solutions for 2 and 1 proper solution for the remaining one. Even though I struggled, I reached the solution in the end. One of the interviewer was wearing a tshirt and shorts and didn't seem interested at all. He was actually hoping that I would have revised leetcode and just jotted down the correct answer. I would recommend that if you can revise and learn the top 20 questions from Leetcode, you will get through because it's the most important thing and even though you have patents or experience in multiple domains, it doesn't count.",

        "details": "I applied through a recruiter who contacted me in September. She was nice and we booked a Phone/Screen coding interview.They are using CoderPad for these. This first interview consisted of 3 questions, they all seemed pretty easy and then the interviewer asked for edge cases, a bit more challenging but nothing impossible. The interviewer was really nice and encouraging.After that, I had another Phone/Screen interview which was basically the same.\u2026\u00a0 There was a basic question which was to code an observer pattern. It wasn't too hard but much more challenging than the first one, especially when the interviewer ask about some edge cases. Again the interviewer was really nice and encouraging and giving you clues when he saw I was blocked.I finally got to the last step, the onsite interview, and it was a bit different in my opinion. First, the process took a lot of time, I had a chat with a recruiter but I didn't know if I would have the interview in London or in Menlo Park. It took almost a month before I had the interview organised. I finally flew from London to Menlo Park for the onsite interview, the organisation was pretty easy though, everything is arranged by Facebook, I flew 2 days before the interview and returned the evening after the interview.The onsite interview consisted of 4x45 min interview, 2 coding interviews on a whiteboard, 1 conversation interview and 1 architecture interview. I felt like one of the coding interview was much harder than any other interview I had with Facebook and it was also much harder to get things right on a whiteboard, and I was absolutely terrible at this one. The other coding interview was more like the phone/screen interview, not too hard but a bit more challenging when I got to the edge cases, it made me wonder if I've just been very unlucky for the first coding interviews that I had a much harder one, but well that's part of the game. I can see that people were asked to code the array flatten in a iterative and recursive way for the first phone/screen interview, but I did it in a recursive way only, so I guess I got lucky in other interviews.In those interviews you will be mostly asked algorithms questions: iterative and recursive patterns, complexity (big O notation) and data structures. Don't hesitate to ask questions and to talk about the problem before even starting to code, that's very important especially that on a white board it's much harder to amend code (you can't copy paste or add line breaks everywhere), it's very important to know what you're going to do before writing anything, rather than writing as you think, like I did. Also the interviewers were very nice and encouraging even though I was terrible, they kept giving me clues and ways to think. I also was super stressed and slept around 3h the night before because of the jetlag, which didn't help.Besides those coding interviews that were the challenging part for me, the conversation interview was more about getting to know me and classic interview questions (Why Facebook? Why Front End? Tell about a project you had and how you solved it? Tell about a conflict you had at work and how you dealt with it?), for this one the recruiter told me about all these questions before so I had everything prepared.The architecture interview was more about how you would approach a front end problem and how you would structure your code, whether it's about HTML, CSS or Javascript. This one didn't seem to be too hard, if you have enough experience with layouts and front end issues, it shouldn't be fine.After that one, I came back to London in the evening, a recruiter called me on Skype 2 days later and told me the team didn't want to go forward. I was kind of expecting it since I haven't been good in the coding interviews, still I was very disappointed and frustrated that I went all the way to Menlo Park, visited the Facebook HQ and that I eventually failed... But still the recruiter was very nice and keen to give me any feedback, I was just so disappointed that I didn't ask anything.In the end I'd say it was a very positive experience, all the people I've been in touch with were very kind and encouraging, the interviews seemed reasonable and looked like things I should be able to solve if I was a top coder. I have to wait more than 1 year to try again and I might do it, I hope I can have the onsite interview in London this time.",

I passed the on-campus interview and then went on-site in Seattle about a week later. During the on-site interview, I felt I choked and got too nervous. Overall, the questions were challenging, but nothing that was extremely difficult.During the on-campus interview, it was structured that I was asked about my background for around 5-8 minutes, and then had a technical question, and then got to ask the interviewer any questions I had. However, during the on-site interview, the interviewer told me about himself, and then immediately told me we were going to try to get through 2 technical questions. We then started the questions and got through about 1.5 of them. It should have been possible to get through both if I was less nervous.The biggest con to the overall process was the lack of interaction with my interviewer on the on-site interview. I felt he didn't get an accurate sense of my ability as an overall programmer and peer since there was no chance to introduce myself. Due to this, I didn't get a chance to converse even a little bit before doing the technical questions, which I think might have helped with relaxing a little bit.Overall a good experience, but I wish there was a chance to be a little bit more personable with my on-site interviewer.",

The phone interview was quite easy actually and the interviewer was super nice and helpful.Two days later I was contacted again to\u2026\u00a0 set up onsite interviews. A couple days before the interview, one of their recruiters called me and told me absolutely everything I needed to know for the onsite interviews and what to expect. Right then it was evident that he really did care how well I did and I wasn't just another candidate.The onsite interviews consisted on just a single 45 minute long technical interview along with a free lunch, tours around their Seattle offices, and a few presentations by some of their engineers.Just a week later I got the call that I got an offer! Overall, Facebook was by far the best company I have ever interviewed with. They really try and take care of you and sell you the company, instead of just shuffling you through interviews. Because of my interview experience alone I decided to take the offer.",

Super disappointed in my performance because it's a really valid, interesting question.This was in part due to the fact that I had\u2026\u00a0 gotten sick earlier in the day, and also due to the fact that our BlueJeans call kept cutting out. We eventually switched to phone, but our connection was extremely poor and I had to run to the roof of my apartment building while answering questions to find a good connection.I guess the moral of the story is:1) Call your recruiter to reschedule an interview if you're sick the day of an interview and don't think you'll perform your best.2) Make absolutely, 3000% sure that your internet connection and phone connection is reliable before your interview.",

We had a really great conversation during the initial phone screen where we discussed all the normal stuff: prior experience, why I'm interested in Facebook, etc. I was asked to provide two writing samples that showcased my writing and strategic thinking, which I sent over the following morning. I heard back immediately from the recruiter about\u2026\u00a0 moving on to the next round of interviews which consisted of a video call with the hiring manager. We walked through one of my samples and discussed the position further. Everything went really well and the job sounded amazing\u2013I had a really great feeling about it all! The next day I heard back from the recruiter again saying that the hiring manager really liked me and wanted to move onto the writing assignment, to which I was more than happy to complete.I was given 72 hours to work on the assignment, which was very in-depth. The assignment consisted of two parts; the first part was to identify two different content opportunities on Facebook and talk about what information was required to make a solid recommendation, as well as what my approach would be to implement those recommendations. The second part was to re-envision the content for an existing experience. I was informed that the assignment would be graded on strategic thinking, tone/voice, and visual polish. So I turned in a very in-depth assignment and eagerly awaited feedback. I was informed I would hear back within the following three days. That came and went so I followed up with the recruiter. I was informed I would hear back by the end of the week. That came and went as well. Finally, I reached out one last time the next Monday (about 3 weeks since our initial discussion) and was informed that my score was too low on the assignment but was given no further explanation. I was incredibly disappointed to hear the news as I worked really hard on the assignment and was very much interested in the opportunity. Another week has gone by and I still have not received final feedback. I am always open to constructive criticism, so it would have been great to know what the company was looking for in the end. Hopefully, I'll from the recruiter this week as promised.",

The day of the interview comes, I have an hour long talk with three different teams, all of which I thought went great (two of them even verbally said they would love to have me and to hear a follow-up shortly). I was ecstatic at the thought of interning for Facebook, and the recruiter told me I would hear back a decision in two business days.Well I didn't hear back in a two days. The recruiter messaged me a week later that it would take a bit longer to make a decision. One evening a week after that I get a copy pasted response from recruiter about how Facebook will be not be moving forward with an offer and that there were many qualified candidates this year.Shame on the recruiter for not keeping to original timeline. Shame on the teams for lying to me about joining their team. It's good to know they put off my decision to hire these \"more qualified candidates\".

I had a first informal chat with a senior engineer on the Menlo Park campus then nothing happened for a couple of months until I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter that organized a phone screen.The first question was \"tell me about an Android API you have worked with\". A very open question where I talked about the MediaCodec APIs and tried to explain\u2026\u00a0 how Android sometimes releases APIs in their early stage without all the details being polished. In that case, the lack of asynchronous APIs and undocumented hardware behaviour. But also that having the source code helps a lot and that the Android team is really quick to update the APIs too. I'm pretty sure the interviewer did not know the MediaCodec API and did not really understand what I said. It was a one way conversation. In retrospect, I wish I had just talked about the View APIs or something more famous.Then the interviewer asked 2 coding questions on coderpad. Although I had the overall general idea, I made some mistakes which explains why I didn't get an offer. The interviewer will not tell you if the answer is correct or not so you have to be relatively confident. Don't do like me and be sure to be pretty comfortable with the leetcode/codefight stuff.",

        "details": "After an three prior phone interviews at Facebook that happened through employee referrals, I was pleasantly surprised to embark on one of the most pleasant interview experiences of my career. My process went as follows (Day # = Business Day from beginning of process)Day 1(am): LinkedIn outreach from recruiterDay 1: (pm): Phone screen with recruiter - 30 MinutesDay 3: Onsite interview with hiring manager - 30 MinutesDay 5: Onsite Interview\u2026\u00a0 with (4) Cross-functional interviewers - 30 minutes eachDay 12: Onsite Interview with 1 additional cross-functional and 1 senior leaderDay 16: Video Conference with Sr. LeaderDay 20: Video Conference with hiring managerDays 29 & 30: Reference checksDay 31: Offer PresentationDay 36: Offer AcceptanceLikely similar to others whom have applied to Facebook, I've had experience phone and onsite interviews with their peers including Google, Amazon and Apple. Google and Amazon's process is more consistent given where they are in their respective company life cycles. Apple and Facebook are a little more flexible based on the needs of the hiring manager. I think both approaches work well.Throughout my successful process with Facebook, and in my prior three unsuccessful interview processes, the recruitment team was swift with feedback. Though there was a two week gap between my final interview and when I was notified references would be checked, there were no surprises as the two week processes was communicated to me on the day of my final interview.Facebook and Google each provide white glove service to candidates and they take employee referrals very seriously. Even when it doesn't work out for a candidate, they want to make the experience enjoyable so top talent reconsiders Facebook in the future. It can be very easy to be discouraged when you're notified that a hiring team is \"going in another direction\" or \"this may not be the right fit for you\", but the way in which negative outcomes are communicated is one sign of a great hiring process.I also want to compliment Facebook for being transparent in their two-week timeline after my final interview. I suspect other candidates were being evaluated and I had to patiently trust the process. About a week after my final interview, the recruitment team checked in with me and they gave me a courtesy heads up when my offer was coming and references would be checked. It allowed me to circle back with my other non-Facebook job searches and complete or exit.I'm not sure how my experience compares to others but I feel much better about making employee referrals in the future to bring great talent to Facebook knowing candidates will be treated with respect whether it reaches offer stage or not.Facebook may not be the right place for everyone, but I am very happy with my experience and know that if it didn't work out, they would have treated my process with respect given all the time I committed to the process.Google's former head of People Ops Laszlo Bock wrote a Book called Work Rules and I hope there is a Facebook version created that will help other companies adopt Facebook's best practices.",

Not only that, engineers conducting the interview will put you under more scrutiny\u2026\u00a0 than they would other candidates. You will be at a disadvantage from the first question. Simply, they are not used to hiring engineers from your background and they will set you up to fail the interview, a self fulfilling prophecy.My advice to Facebook is, in general, train well your engineers in regards to unconscious bias and have them certify before allowing them to conduct interviews. In particular, I would add to no let engineers on sponsored visas that have been in the country for only a short time conduct interviews to citizens and permanent (green card) residents as they do not understand yet the race dynamics of the U.S.A.

You can tell that a lot of thought and care have gone into their recruiting process.I saw that they were hiring for front end engineers in Seattle, so I applied on a whim and sort of forgot about it after a while. A couple months later, a recruiter\u2026\u00a0 reached out to me and we had an initial phone conversation. This was a very initial screen that was mostly non-technical with the exception of some quick and simple JavaScript pop-quiz questions at the end (== vs ===, describe event delegation, etc).Next step was a technical phone screen. This was pretty fast-paced as the interviewer was trying to squeeze in as much as possible in a short amount of time while leaving time at the end to field my questions. He did a very good job at keeping things moving and on track, asking me some general questions about my background and then some simple coding exercises to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS, and consequences of going with different design choices. Then a simple JavaScript tree problem.Next were the in person interviews. This is the part I thought they did exceptionally well compared with other companies. The whole process was extremely transparent and I was given lots of information and resources ahead of time so that I knew what to expect. It consisted of 2 coding (ninja) interviews, a design (pirate) interview, and a behavioral (jedi) interview, all about 45 minutes each. Between interviews a lunch was scheduled with another engineer, who is not part of the feedback loop, giving me plenty of opportunities to ask my questions about company and culture, as well as get a tour of the office.Overall, the questions seemed very relevant to the position. The interviewers were also super friendly and helpful along the way, and seemed to genuinely want you to succeed. No over-bearing egos set out to prove how much smarter than you they were, or trying to trip you up with trick questions or irrelevant questions (I've been asked physics questions before for front-end roles, sigh).Great experience.",

Three days later, I received a reject email.Overall, I liked the interview process and everyone was great. I would have appreciated a call, just as a courtesy. The lack of courtesy seemed to me that the recruiter did not seem as much enthusiastic after on-site compared to before the on-site interview. It is understandable though, but she was thoroughly professional whenever I worked with her.One more thing, if Facebook has so high a rejection rate, it is better to have phone screen + a video call screen, before bringing people in.

The third was a question that I hadn't seen before and that I found challenging. I ran out of time on this particular session.The system design question was relatively straightforward.The discussion + coding session threw me for a loop. I had a discussion with the interviewer for most of the session about various situations in the past. Suddenly, he said \"ok, we have less than ten minutes left, time to code\". It was a little jarring and I had a little bit of a tough time switching gears so suddenly. The question itself wasn't too difficult, but the sudden change caught me off guard and I had some mistakes in my solution.Overall the interviewers were very nice and respectful. When I had the opportunity to ask questions, it felt like they were hones and sincere in their answers (it didn't feel like unnecessary corporate cheerleading).After my onsite had concluded, I received an email for feedback on the interview, which was nice. They asked for detailed feedback on the interview and whether or not the folks were on time for the sessions. It seems like Facebook takes their interview process and the feedback seriously (from what I can gather).In the end, I was not extended an offer, but the overall process was very efficient and smooth.",

They also want something super visual, but tell you it should only take a few hours to complete the exercise for a role that's not specifically intended to be a visual designer role.If you're gonna do it, just be sure ahead of time to hunker down and don't be overly critical. Also ask the recruiter more specific questions about what they're looking for, they will probably have some insight and can be useful. Be sure to check your work and let other people look at it before you send it, because they're going to be exacting and since there's no way for them to know who you are -- they think this is fairer -- you're basically going to be judged coldly and if it doesn't hit the mark, then game over.",

        "details": "I was solicited by FB recruiter through LinkedIn. I followed up given my perception of FB being fast pace and open culture. After PS, I went on-site which contains the standard 5 rounds: behavioral & culture fit; coding; coding; design; design.I was never a fan of behavioral questions and never felt such questions are inspirational, FB is no difference. There was a quick 10-minute coding problem near the end of\u2026\u00a0 this round --- you have no time to think but just to code it up. The first coding problem is simple but a little tedious to write code. The second coding problem is medium difficulty with two parts. The first part is simple and I quickly code it. I had to think about the second part to identify the algorithm but had no time to implement it.In both design rounds, despite the interviewer\u2019s claim that the problem is opened-ended without perfect answer, and what\u2019s important is the thought process, he didn\u2019t really mean it --- a solution that perfectly matches what the interviewer had in mind is expected. The interviewer, graduated from school a few years back, does not have rich project experiences to handle deviations from his standard solution. The interviewer simply likes to move fast on the track of his solution. Any deviation from that track becomes a distraction instead of part of true problem solving process.Overall I am disappointed with FB interview process. The FB interview loop obviously not really evaluate and identify true problem solving skills or experiences but just how fast you can write bug-free code for simple algorithm problem with little or no time to think. It effectively requires that you have coded the same or very similar problem very recently. I am confident on my coding and problem solving skills and like to present the daily true me instead of an interview-prepared me.FB hires lots of young graduates and expect them to write fast code. Maybe coding fast and breaking things is fine for web pages, but I suspect how terrible their back-end infrastructure would be due to the code fast mentality.",

Somehow made it to the third round anyway. (Recruiter Screen, Hiring Manager, Person I'd have been working with closely- all\u2026\u00a0 phone). The people I met with were great, but my experience overall was not.I had another job offer that came in during the process, and I told Facebook this (and initially they worked with me on it), but after the 2nd round interview they just fell off the face of the planet. I tried e-mailing them to see if I could get some feedback or a sense of whether or not I was moving forward, and I got no reply. The other company had a second choice candidate they were about to lose, and so I decided to turn them down so they didn't lose that candidate. (They had waited long enough for me).Then like two weeks later FB gets back to me and acts as though I had never sent any email about the job offer, and schedules a third round. It wasn't a great interview (as in, I wasn't great. The person I met with was lovely). I didn't hear back, and after like a week I e-mailed the recruiter to ask if they needed anything else from me. Nothing. It's pretty clear I didn't get the job, but it would've been nice if three rounds had earned me at least an email reply.I've never understood those people who talked about recruiting horror stories, but I guess now I do. Don't get me wrong- Facebook is fantastic, and the people from the org I met with were great. But it definitely wasn't a very respectful recruiting process.

The recruiter then handed me off to another recruiter who handled the phone interviews.This is where the interview process went south fast. It took the recruiter 3 weeks to get this setup and throughout the process did\u2026\u00a0 not update me on what was going on. I had to email the recruiter several times about an update after each week of radio silence.Phone interviews went great, had video conference calls with 2 separate designers: one focused on app critique and the other on portfolio review. Had a positive experience with both of them, luckily the interview where back to back.Once the interviews were over I did not hear back from the recruiter even though I followed up and asked about what to expect for the next steps. I had to wait another 3 weeks before I heard from the recruiter and said they wanted to continue onto the onsite interview. She then handed me off to the onsite recruiter.The onsite recruiter was also problematic. After responding to their email right away each time, it took an entire week to nail down a date to chat about the onsite process. I waited for their call and they never called, I even followed up with them right away and didn't get a response until that night with an excuse of \"my phone died\" and they didn't even bother to apologize. After several back and forth, I got the onsite interview setup.The onsite interview was by far the best experience. They arranged for an Uber to pick me up from and take me home. The onsite was a portfolio review, an group app critique, lunch interview, whiteboard exercise (\"rethink the ATM\") and a background interview with a hiring manager. The hiring manager asked if we could spend more time talking after I time was up and they gave me a tour of the building and talked up the benefits of working at Facebook. I left feeling positive and the hiring manager even gave me pointers when looking for a team within Facebook.I followed up with the recruiter the same day and didn't hear back until over a week later. They ended up saying \"No Hire\" but wanted to keep my profile on file (unsure why).Overall, my experience was terrible given that it took 3 months to do the entire process and the recruiters were the worst part. The actual teams were great and seemed like great people I'd want to work with. Hopefully they can sort out their recruiters.",

The other 2 interviews were on system design. The algorithm questions could be found on leetcode\u2026\u00a0 and careercup. The system design focused on distributed system.Practice was the key. Though, I had about 3 weeks to prepare for the interviews, as a father of 2 toddlers, I could only have a couple of hours here and there. It's pretty hard to study when another pair of little hands are also banging the keyboards at the same time. With limited time, I focused more on the algorithm questions and did well on the coding rounds.However, a week after the on-site, HR informed me the decision to reject my application due to the poor performance on the design round. I didn't think I did badly on the design round, but with a large candidate pool, I guess they could be very selective on hiring. It's really a devastating feeling to see your faith controlled by some 20-yo. Still, I feel with more practice on the system design questions, it's not impossible to get there.",

Surprisingly recruiter asked me a technical question, it was not hard (Fibonacci function and its optimizations), but it was unexpected. Anyway I answered her question in details (bottom up solution, top down, DP) and she replied that it's exactly what she expected to hear.Since I'm local to\u2026\u00a0 Bay Area I had an opportunity to have 1:1 onsite screen instead of phone screen. I choose that option and we arranged the interview in a week. Onsite screen was good, the interviewer was very nice and friendly, he was very helpful during the interview and there was an impression that we wanted to see my process of thinking. Eventually I solved the problem that was average difficulty. I started with brute force and then optimized it. In 2 days I got a call from the recruiter, she told I did well and we scheduled onsite interview.There were 5 interview for onsite: whiteboard programming -> whiteboard programming -> resume discussion with coding -> architecture discussion -> whiteboard programming. The problems were average difficulty. I was kind of slow on the first and last coding, I think it was expected to solve a couple of problems instead of one. All interviewers were very friendly and helpful, at the end all of them shared that I solved the problem correctly and in an efficient way and that it was OK that we solved only one problem.I already wanted to say that regardless the result my experience was positive, but after the interview I got a pretty bad experience. I didn't have any response or feedback for 2 weeks after the interview. I expected the rejection, but the silence in the first week gave me some hope that they are thinking about me (I was slow on the interview, but I didn't fail it completely). After the first week of silence I tried to contact me recruiter and eventually I figured out that she left Facebook and didn't move my case to anyone.

At the time, I was working at a competing Silicon Valley tech company, where I had\u2026\u00a0 been fast-tracked into a very quick promotion. Early in the interview process, I told my recruiter what my total compensation and rough salary expectations were.I was surprised, then, when the recruiter made an offer with a base salary that was $12K less than what I had been making. More insultingly, the total compensation of the offer was _$60K_ less than what I was making at the time. The recruiter said the company was unlikely to budge much on either fronts because it was consistent with the level of the role.Needless to say, I found the $60K delta to be an absolute joke. For many, $60K is an entire year's salary. I also couldn't understand why the recruiter would waste not only my time but the company's time by investing in a full-fledged recruiting process, even bringing me on site, knowing that he would be making an unrealistic offer that no one in her right mind would accept.Moreover, did he or the hiring team think that just because I was a petite minority female, I would be a doormat? Even if this assessment wasn't a conscious/intentional one, the offer was honestly a damning testament to the company's utter obliviousness at best or flagrant disregard for diversity and inclusion.",

I have several years of research experience, but the researcher asked me two hypothetical questions (which I wasn't expect to be asked until onsite interview stage) and while I was answering how I would solve a research scenario, the researcher kept a straight-face and probed with follow up questions that made me feel like I was answering incorrectly which of course made me feel less confident about my answers and I'm sure that came across in the interview.I should mention this was my first interview in over two years and I was a little nervous, so this could be why I didn't do as well as I thought I would. I have interviewed at Google for a user researcher position and wasn't asked hypotheticals until I was onsite. I was allowed to work on the white board and had more time to answer them.

There was no\u2026\u00a0 indication what so ever from the interviewer if there was anything wrong in my solutions. However, I'm guessing that since I couldn't finish in time to run through couple of examples, I got rejected. They don't give any grace period, if there's no time left, they end it abruptly. I guess they want to be fair to everyone. There was absolutely no feedback from any of the interviewers during the process, so it's hard understand what are they looking for, if anything is going wrong. This is true for the system-design as well.In my case looks like the decision was already made before lunch, the last round interviewers seemed completely un-interested. One of them was on the laptop typing continuously while I was presenting my solution.I'm sure they are able to find people who are able to code the solution in time. In my opinion, for most, this is only possible if you have already coded same or similar problem. There are tons of websites that lists the questions. Just spend enough time to practice them in coding.The interviews are less about problem solving ability, it's more about finishing the code in time.

And mentioned that there will be 2 phone interviews and then an\u2026\u00a0 on-site interview.First interview and second phone interview went very well, I cannot imagine anything that I would have done better in these two interviews.But got an email from recruiter that they would like to go with the third phone screen before they can call me on-site.Third interview: Interviewer explains me a problem which is similar to a 3sum problem and asks me to write a solution for it. I hadn't 'summarized' the solution and, this how it goes between me and the interviewer:Me: \"The problem you are explaining is quite similar to a well known problem of 3sum\"She: \"Yes\"Me: (explained the approach,the time and space complexities associated with it of 3sum)She: \"Lets see some code\"(I start writing the code and continuously explain what I am doing. Once I write the core algorithm I told her)Me: \"So this is the core algorithm, and we just need to add null checks and add corner cases.\"She: \"OK lets go thru your algorithm, how will it behave in (this corner case)\"Me: \"As I mentioned, this is the core of the algorithm, we still need to do null checks and consider corner cases.\"I add null checks and 2 corner cases and then we started going through lot of scenarios, my code holds good in all of them and the interview continues like normal. So, I thought I had aced this interview too.I get an email from the recruiter saying they will pass for now. I ask for the feedback and they mention that I used 'brute force method' to implement (a certain corner case). I said to myself, I was still implementing the algorithm, ofcourse you will run through many scenarios before you call the code done.But I guess others out there are right, interviewers at facebook wants bookish knowledge. It doesnt matter how many years of experience, you still need to topple all the algorithm books and go summarize leetcode before the interview. Your experience, your profile, the projects that you have worked on and your 'non algorithm' technical knowledge doesnt matter or may be it matters only after the fact that you have successfully summarized algorithms.And, its not like I am disillusioned.I am a Senior dev, in my early 30s working for a quite good corporation in the valley and I have been interviewing, hiring and mentoring junior dev from many many years now. And the fact that I didnt even clear a phone screening is quite interesting to me.I am quite disappointed and it makes me think: Did the recuriter reached out to me even though there were none actual positions open? Or did it get filled up somewhere in the middle and I got a 'false' reason for rejection?",

I asked questions, she refused to answer. I tried to clarify points, she simply said, \"what do you think?\" I came away convinced that the interview is focused on testing candidates who have very little real-world experience, and therefore can't give examples of real situations in which they've had to use their product instincts or execute under tough conditions. Consequently, the questions focus on hypotheticals that don't provide an accurate picture of a candidate's skills, and, in fact, provide a warped picture of an experienced candidate who is accustomed to working with facts and real situations.I know that Facebook thinks they're very \"data driven\" about this hiring process, but I think they've headed down the wrong path for more senior PM candidates (I have 15 years of product management experience).After the interview, I didn't receive any call back from the recruiter. I didn't pursue it, because the negative experience I had led me to conclude that I don't want to work there. But, the lack of follow-up isn't a particularly good sign either.",

I was also asked what\u2026\u00a0 I might want to work on at FB. A few weeks later I had a video interview with one of the UX researchers in Menlo where they asked me to pick a product, identify a UX problem, and describe how I would conduct research. A couple of weeks later I was told that I had made it to the final round of interviews which consisted of going on site to Menlo Park. Part of the final round involved getting a research problem 48 hours before the interview that I needed to prepare a talk on how I would design the research. On site I was there from 9am to 3pm, where I gave my talk, answered questions about my research design, and then had four seperate ~40 minute interviews. Questions in the individual interviews addressed my research interests, my interests in broader current issues around UX and communication technology, and personal working style and collaboration style.

After a couple of weeks, the HR confirmed to me about the telephonic rounds.\u2026\u00a0 There were two back to back telephonic rounds, coding followed by an SQL round.For the first round, I was called around 5 minutes late for the interview. The interviewer asked me about my previous work experience and then asked to start coding. The questions were pretty simple and I could answer all of them. There was one that required little thinking but I eventually solved it. I already had my next round of interview scheduled so the interviewer said that he could not ask me further questions. It was a very abrupt end to my interview although I solved all the questions.The second round was on SQL queries and this was really easy to crack. The queries were complex but I knew the concept and so could form them correctly. Only the last question asked for little complex related to cross join. I managed to answer but could not get the correct answer. This interview lasted longer than 45 minutes. The interviewer was very friendly and communicated very professionally.After both the rounds, I was very confident that I had cracked the interview as I could solve all the questions asked. But unfortunately, I got an email after a week saying that I have not cleared the round. This was very surprising to me as I kept wondering where I went wrong.

Then there were 3 phone interviews, each technical, consisting of coding, systems, and networking.The coding interview was straight forward and it was clear that this was a skill that is necessary, but not as important as the others.The systems interview was where\u2026\u00a0 I personally had the biggest issue. Not because of the material, but because of the content, and interviewer. The interviewer was the stereotypical Silicon Valley Nerd bully who even warned me before we started that he comes of \"a little d*uchey.\" The moment he said that I knew that the interview was not going to go well. He would not clarify ANY of his questions, he would assume that my sub questions revealed lack of understanding or knowledge. The questions were ridiculous, down to how certain flag options affect the output of certain commands. I understand that a production engineer must know these details, but it is extremely stupid and unrealistic to think that these details cannot be looked up.Long story short, I feel like they didnt even test how much I actually knew about how Linux actually works, just how to look for certain arcane items that vary from distro to distro.Following this disaster, I was informed by the recruiter that they were \"not able to offer me the position\", as well as \"not able to share feedback.\" Very bitter taste in someones mouth that had been studying and preparing for weeks, sometimes at the expense of my current job, just to be told \"no\" with zero accountability as to why.Oh wait, but there is more. After a long weekend of sadness and self reflection, I was called again by the recruiter, to say that \"they actually want to continue the process to the networking interview, due to the fact that there are many PE teams that deal a lot more with networking than with systems.\" Naturally, I was ecstatic, seeing as how I am currently in the networking field, and would be able to crush any interview regarding networking.The networking interview came along, which I aced completely. I was contacted the next day, told that they were \"not able to offer me the position\" and \"not able to share feedback\"... again. Very weird and ridiculous considering the fact that they called me specifically to test my networking knowledge, only to ask super basic networking questions, have me get them right, then tell me no, and waste yet another week of my time and energy.The Recruiter at facebook was fantastic, the overall experience was not. All of the interviewers were fantastic, except for the systems one. All it takes is one egomaniac that thinks only the worthy should have the chance to work alongside them.\u00a0Big attractive companies get away with lack of accountability in the interview process, and literally do not care at all about providing legitimate reasons as to why they think you cant do a job that you know you can do.",

        "details": "I attended Facebook's University Day, where they had about 20 university students who were there for interviews. The day starts off with the interview itself, then you spend about 5 hours touring the Facebook campus and learning more about Facebook. When the interview process began, all of us were siting in a room and interviewers would come in and call our names. I watched as interviewer after interviewer came in\u2026\u00a0 with cheerful looks on their faces and called out names of other students. After about 5 minutes, my interviewer came in and called me. He was a heavy set man, dressed sloppy, and had a look on his face like he didn't want to be there. I could tell right away that it would not go well. When we entered the interview room, he immediately began asking technical questions. He didn't ask any questions about me to get to know me, and after asking other students that were there, they all began with a talk about their backgrounds. During the entire interview, I had the impression that my interviewer just wanted to rush me through so he could go on to do something else. He asked me 2 questions, one which went well and a second where I had a bit of trouble. My recruiter had told me beforehand that if we got stuck on a question, our interviewer would make an effort to get us back on track by offering hints. My interviewer did no such thing. I even told him what I was trying to do, and why I was getting stuck, implying that I could use a hint. He just sat there without saying anything. Finally after I wasted about 10 minutes trying different ways to solve it, he tells me that we're running out of time and hurries me through the rest of the problem. He gave me the last 5 minutes to ask him questions. Since I had a feeling that he was being forced to be there, one of my questions was if Facebook employees have dedicated interviewers, or if random employees are selected to be interviewers from time to time. He said it was the latter. So of course I knew that he was being forced to be there and he just wanted it to end. After the interview was over, he walked me back to meet the other students. By this time I already knew he wasn't going to give me a good review, but Facebook doesn't all you to go home at this point. You're forced to spend 5 hours learning about how wonderful it is to work at Facebook so that you know about all the good things you just missed out on. A week later I received my rejection email.",

        "details": "I recently completed a full interview sequence with Facebook and thought it would be useful to recap it all for the next candidates coming down the pipeline.The way your interviewing experience starts is with a technical phone screen which lasts for about an hour. If you pass that you'll be invited out to Menlo Park. My interviewing day started at 9:45 a.m. and officially finished at 2 p.m. (but I\u2026\u00a0 didn't actually leave until closer to 3 p.m.). The recruiters are very upfront about what happens in the interview -- the initial \"jedi\" session which is a combination culture-fit and a supposed \"easy\" coding question, two \"ninja\" sessions which are in-depth coding / algorithm exercises (which I've recapped below), and one \"pirate\" session which is an architecture & design session.In terms of difficulty, I felt that the questions were relatively fair. They weren't as relentlessly challenging & tricky as what I've encountered at a traditional Google interview. but none of them were a particularly easy walk through the park. My own personal performance was probably negatively impacted by the stuffiness of the tiny interview room (of course adjusting the thermostat didn't seem to make a difference) and my general nerves (which are always in panic mode every time I'm doing these hard core technical screenings).On the flip side, I was really impressed with the working environment for employees, such as thoughtful touches such as all bathrooms being stocked with thoughtful & useful items (toothbrushes & paste, feminine care items, etc.),The campus is on the shores of San Francisco Bay, so depending on the weather (or the drought) you might be getting a view of water or of a marshy field. I have a feeling that commute times to campus can be frustratingly long, depending on where you live in the Bay Area. If you are able to handle whatever commute you end up having to do, the split campus *IS* a gorgeous and inspiring place. I say \"split campus\" because there's two different Facebook campuses on both sides of Highway 84. The older campus is on the East side, and the reason it feels like direct copy of the Downtown Disney mall in Anaheim is because it was done that way on purpose. The newer West building is a massive showpiece designed by Frank Gehry, and after my 5 hour interview party was over with, I was able to do a 10-15 minute walk around the beautiful rooftop gardens there with the recruiter.Weirdly enough, aside from a \"how do you think you did?\" follow-up from one of the recruiters a couple days after the interviewing day, I never heard anything back from anyone. In other words, it's been over a month and I never got the official rejection e-mail or phone call. My guess is the recruiters either lost track of me (which seems strange because they were so on top of arrangements prior to the interview) or they extended offers to one wave of candidates and let other \"runner-up\" candidates dangle while the first wave made decisions. That was really the only process hiccup along the way.Hopefully my experience flunking the Facebook interview will help you to prepare to pass your interviewing day.

Ironically, this is one of the cases\u2026\u00a0 where I needed it the least. It really just wasn't as technically challenging as interviews at Google or Microsoft.He then followed up and was super flexible on the phone screen which I opted to do in person. It's on the candidates schedule and terms. Very accommodating. During the in-person initial screen, the recruiter again offered tons of preparation and \"pep talk.\" He did say not to rush and to take my time, which is definitely a tendency of mine. Don't listen to that advice, though. My adherence to this advice was ultimately cited as the reason for my rejection (my slow deliberation was interpreted as \"struggling\"). But otherwise, it was extremely helpful and really great.The interviewer I was scheduled with was out sick so I got another guy. It was the least adversarial interview of the Google/MS/Amazon style I've ever done. He was helpful and supportive. Very laid back (he was wearing sweat pants and a T-shirt) which really helped.I really took my time and avoided going into rush-panic like I do, and was only able to get through one question in the allotted time. I answered it and came up with the solution on my first try (very long and deliberate first try), which even my interviewer said he couldn't do during his interview. But at the end of the day, I was rejected anyway.It showed that it's important not to obsess over the technical preparation. The guy who interviewed me probably was less prepared technically when he interviewed, but he probably did a better job on the soft skills. And he got the job. I worked through on the technical front with no issue, but probably spoke without a sense of confidence and made bad jokes while slowly deliberating through the problem.",

He did not really want me to start coding before I had the best solution. I struggled 30 seconds to find a good solution, then he gave me a helpful hint and I could figure it out. I discovered later that my program had a bug, but the interviewer did not seem to notice it.The second technical interviewer had a strong Chinese accent and was tougher for me to understand. He first asked a relatively simple array question and then told me to run my solution manually on a medium-sized example. This was long, painful, and not really insightful. I also was not sure if he did this because my solution was buggy. He then asked me a harder more mathematical question. With luck and intuition I was able to figure out a very efficient solution. I did not feel like the interview was a huge success, and the interviewer did not seem super friendly.Finally I got to talk with engineers from 3 different teams: a static analysis team in Menlo Park, a very research-y team in Seattle, and a compiler team in Menlo Park. This was always casual and nice to talk with them. They let me pick the team I wanted, I chose the compiler team.",

Last step was an on-site interview that started\u2026\u00a0 with a 45-minute research presentation (you have 3 days days to prep, but was pretty difficult given that I had a day job) with Q&A, lunch with a researcher, and four 1:1 interviews that were 45-minutes each. Recruiters were nice and helpful. Panel members had various backgrounds and experiences, and would engage depending on how familiar they were with your background or skills (some friendly, others not as much...but general feeling of being rushed and pressed for time). Decision was made in a few days, but no feedback provided from final round (also noticed that recruiter copy-pasted a template email based on the differences in fonts which made it more impersonal).",

        "details": "Recruiter call and 2 phone interviews.Both phone interviews were with relatively easy tasks. The first one was two tasks - the first one was to calculate a sorted array of power of 2 for already sorted array of integers. The trick is that the negative numbers will become positive, you have to merge the negative with the positive powers of 2. I figured out this in few seconds. The interviewer\u2026\u00a0 though had no idea of c++, it asked me a bunch of basic questions about iterators and he lost my time for the second task, for which I provided only algorithm - it was to print a tree by columns.I received a feedback that I should not optimize my code before I have working solution. And I did good, but not great, so I need to have a second phone interview where I will be asked more complex task - make no sense to me, but ok.On the second interview I had again someone with no c++ experience. He asked me to create a powerset. I implemented it (and after the interview I copy/pasted it and it was working with one syntax issue). Surprisingly this was not enough for me to move to the next round. The interviewer was openly confused from the solution - maybe because it was not exact fit with what he read in internet. It took me forever to explain the algorithm that I am going to implement and he just hm-ed there. Then it took me a while to explain to him while reverse_iterator.base() does not return the item the reverse_iterator points, but the next one - not sure that he got it at all.What I learned: I should not use reverse_iterators in interview process. Being smart enough to come up with your own solution is not appreciated - so you should spend a lot of time to find out what other people say - you should do for the tasks. Facebook is the new google as google was the new microsoft a few years ago. Also do not take the Facebook interview preparation class - what they say is not aligned at all with the expectations the actual interviewers have.",

As far as the interview goes, know\u2026\u00a0 your data structures(not just what they are, but how and when to use them for a given problem, I needed to use it twice in different interviews here). In addition, not sure if it is just for PE's but you basically need to know some sort of scripting(preferably both shell and some other like python,php or perl) I dont think some of the questions will be solved easily with out them. Lastly, for the systems rounds(you will have 2(1 phone and 1 onsite) KNOW your basic troubleshooting tools, linux command line, filesystem(for unix/linux based, like what goes where, knowing this will help for some sort of troubleshooting). Also try to solve questions like what to do when some is wrong type of questions. scoutapp's articles for tools was helpful for knowing some troubleshooting.Recruiter recommended a bunch for the coding, my favorite was leetcode. Careercup is good as well. Plus check more on glassdoor too, it especially helped for the first phone screen.Whatever the end outcome you will learn a lot from the experience.

        "details": "On a sidenote: I must say, I am pretty impressed by Facebook and their interview process. Inspite of being from a non CS field and not highly ranked university, they gave me an opportunity to demonstrate my skills. Facebook cares a lot about what skills the person possesses rather than what grades he scored or which university he attended. This alone is enough reason to work at Facebook. I hope\u2026\u00a0 they continue this culture.Coming to my interview:I had applied online via Facebook portal. After around 2 months, I got an email from a recruiter asking me to answer a few general questions. He also asked me to pick a date within next 2-3 weeks for first interview and asked my preferred coding language. He also gave link to a few resources from where I can improve my skills. They are pretty flexible about the whole process as even they want us to succeed.Preparation resources : Geeks for geeks - to understand concepts, leetcode and interviewbit for coding practice. Interviewbit is a particular useful resource, as they have divided problems section wise along with hints and solutions. Cracking the coding interview.Since I have signed a NDA I cannot disclose the actual questions, however, they were medium - tough level ones which a candidate can solve in 45 minutes. Both were skype based interviews and I coded on coderpad.io. The code is not actually executed on it, however we need to walk the interviewer through each line explaining what it does. We also need to explain space and time complexity for all our solutions.First Interview (45 minutes): I was asked to introduce myself and then we directly moved to coding. First problem was based on array. I discussed my approach before coding, during which the interviewer pointed out a flaw in my thinking, which helped me correct my algorithm. We even discussed in which cases my algorithm wont work and suggested changes to solve it. Second problem was kinda hard and I was not unable to come up with a solution, however I brainstormed with him on possible approaches before the time ran out. In the last 5 minutes he answered my questions. I was pretty nervous during the whole interview, as a result a stammered quite a bit.I was pretty dejected by the interview as I was not able to solve the second problem. However within an hour I got an email from the recruiter informing me that I had advanced to the next round. Yay!!!This made me realize that, they are not just looking at getting the right answer, but what approach the candidate follows as well. I scheduled my next interview after 2 weeks.Second Interview (1 hour): Again I was asked to give a short introduction of myself, the interviewer did the same before moving to coding. First question was based on dynamic programming. When i was explaining my approach before coding, the interviewer provided me with a hint which helped me optimize my code from O(n^2) space complexity to O(n). After walking through the code, and explaining the output, I was presented with second problem based on tree. It was a hard problem, and I had read its recursive approach somewhere but couldnt recollect it. So the interview asked me to first write a non optimal code. Once that was done, he gave me hints, through which I was able to modify the above code to a recursive optimal one. In the end he answered a few of my questions.Both my interviews were a two way process, and without the guidance of interviewers I would not be able to come up with correct solutions. Both the interviewers were very helpful and smart.I got an email after a couple of hours from my interviewer that I got the internship :)Next day I was given an offer, which I couldn't refuse.Tips:1. Know basic concepts of data structures and algorithms. Go through the sources mentioned above.2. Discuss approach with interviewer before coding, if they provide a suggestion, USE IT !!3. Relax and have fun. Its a great learning experience.",

The interviews were generally pleasant and moved fast (all 45 min each except for the 30 min initial screen). I advanced between each of the 3 videoconference rounds and was given the notification of the advancement by my recruiter in between each -- it usually took 1 week to set up each subsequent interview.The screening with the recruiter was a review of my background and the position.The interview with the hiring manager was a deeper review of my background, then questions about my strengths and weaknesses as a product lead. Then we spoke about the team I would be joining and the role itself.Next was the product execution interview. I especially enjoyed the product execution interview because the interviewer was someone known in the tech space and a very strong interviewer -- he was very helpful in guiding the discussion, and I left thinking that he was someone I would absolutely love to work with. The questions he asked were centered around prioritizing how users are presented with modules and products on the FB app (particularly People You May Know vs an ad, and a new local search product).Next was the product sense interview. My final interviewer was weaker as an interviewer -- he did not provide as much guidance during the discussion and seemed more junior than my previous interviewers. He first asked me to pick a product I want to work on at FB and what I would do to improve it. Then, he asked an off-the-cuff question about my current industry during the product sense interview, which I believe to be was what led me not to move forward in the hiring process -- I made the big mistake of taking the question literally and went down the wrong path of providing a high level business strategy from the point of view of the business rather than a product strategy from the point of view of the user.After this interview my recruiter infomed me that they would not move forward.I was disappointed after getting this far into the interview process to have it end at this point-- I believe I could have advanced to the final round (it was my next step in the process), but it was definitely my mistake for not keeping the scope of my answer from a product standpoint in my last interview.",

On the day, I made a presentation and had 5 other rounds.About the role: This is a new role for them and they are still figuring out what they are looking for. The person will temporarily report to a lead for a different vertical till they\u2026\u00a0 can figure out a more permanent reporting/management structure. The ambiguity in background and skills required was reflected during multiple conversations and made the interview unnecessarily difficult.Interview experience: I spoke with 8 people during multiple interviews, all of whom were professional but for the recruiter. The conversations with the recruiter were by far the worst professional conversations I have ever had. Email communication was devoid of any punctuation, incomplete and unprofessional. In one case, there were 4 sentences without any punctuation whatsoever.Phone conversations were worse. As an example, when asked what the second phone screen might focus on, the response was \"well we do these phone screens so that we do not waste our interviewers time by getting you here.\". Well, I know the purpose of screening, not what I was asking. Other conversations were similar. I considered pulling out of the interview multiple times to avoid being insulted.She misinformed me about the importance of SQL for the role and interview. Told me that SQL would be most important thing and was worried if I could clear. The job requirements stated SQL as nice-to-have. The SQL interviewer started the interview by saying that I would rarely require to do anything difficult in SQL. He asked very elementary questions during the interview, I wasted days preparing for way more advanced topics.I was given a presentation assignment with more than a month to prepare. The question was described in 3 sentences with internal terminology and expected me to tell FB what to do next for a particular area. She was not willing to have me speak to anyone to get clarifications on the terms used, scope of the problem, goal of the session etc.In the absence of any clarification, I spent multiple weeks working on it. Needless to say it was not what the interviewers had in mind. Simple things that could have been clarified by a 10 min call or a simple email.I went into the interview dreading interacting with the recruiter and came out with a very sour taste, though I am kinda certain my experience would not represent how FB treats their other candidates (having known others who have gone through the process).Earlier feedback on Glassdoor for the vertical that I interacted with (temporary reporting structure) is mostly neutral or negative as well. I feel positively about Facebook, hope they are reading this and will use this feedback to make necessary corrections.",

After that, there was a 45 minute technical phone interview that covered a basic palindrome detection coding exercise that I solved in Python. Several days afterwards, I was invited to a second 45 minute phone interview that focused on performing a merge-sort with pure SQL. Finally, I was\u2026\u00a0 invited to fly out to Menlo Park and interview on-site for an interview loop.The phone interviews went relatively smoothly, both interviewers were incredibly kind and professional. The on-site interview was an amazing experience, but was a night and day difference from the difficulty of the phone interviews. Although substantial in subject, each interviewer was again kind and professional and I got the honest feeling they wanted me to succeed.It was the first interview I've ever had where I didn't feel attacked interrogated and felt at complete ease. Facebook has done a wonderful job at cultivating a supportive and encouraging culture which shone through during the entire interview process.That all said, my best advice for those interview is to not let the colloquial atmosphere lull you into a sense of ease. While the interviews are warm and helpful, their ultimate goal was to choose prime candidates. Be yourself, be honest, but never \"let your guard down\" and choose your words carefully. Every response is measured!Some technical notes on how to prepare (and consequently things I think I fell below the grade on!):1. Be able to effortlessly calculate Big O for any given algorithm.2. Be ready to use both built-in solutions for your chosen programming language and custom. For example, splitting a string by spaces \"by hand\" and using a built-in.3. Switch gears between iterative and recursive. It may not matter what is the most efficient route, but the interviewer may want to see if you're able to solve the problem with either approach.4. Ask for your boundaries. Can you use more than one technology? Can you offload some of the work to the DB? Can you use built-ins?5. Understand the fundamentals for everything you say. For example, know when to approach query optimization with an index and when to solve it with summary tables.6.

It seemed that they were struggling to identify what they wanted and who\u2026\u00a0 they were looking for. One tip I would give future interviewees: be prepared to guide and direct the conversation. If your interviewer is rushed or unprepared, be ready to take control and ask the questions that place you in the best light.I would add that if you are coming from an unconventional background, as I was, you will have to help Facebook understand what you bring to the table. I asked about this early in the process, and it was dismissed as \"not an issue, we like your application very much.\" But in the interview, there were questions like: \"so what do you do, again?\"In retrospect -- and this is not at all meant to be negative, because I think Facebook is a great company and I was flattered to be considered -- I sensed that I might not have enjoyed working for this particular group, since they weren't as sure of what they wanted.

        "details": "I was initially contacted by a recruiter from FB. Had a phone screen with the recruiter, then moved onto a phone interview with one of the (the only) team members. That was followed up by another phone call with the recruiter. Then I was scheduled for an on-site/in-person interview at HQ in Menlo Park. I was flown out by FB, put up in a hotel overnight. I paid to rent\u2026\u00a0 my own car, though they do allow up to $400 to be expensed for the interview process if you're not local.Overall it wasn't a horrible experience, very typical of most tech company interviews. However, I'm rating it negative because of the final interview I had. Due to FB scheduling my interview for a Monday, I had to fly back home that night as I had meetings I was leading at work on Tuesday morning. Because of this, FB rescheduled my final interview to be a video conference. Would have been nice if they had just adjusted my interview time to start earlier in the morning than 11 AM.I felt like everything had gone well for the interview process up until the VC interview. I would like to point out that FB recruited me. I did not apply for any specific position there, nor did I ever submit my resume for employment there. So the VC interview rolls around, and the first thing that happens is this person interviewing me jumps all over me for a few grammatical errors on my resume. And this person doesn't get off this particular subject for a good several minutes, which sets the tone for the rest of the interview. As you can guess, the rest of the VC interview didn't go all that well. This person had already made up their mind based on some grammatical errors on my resume.Listen FB, I know you think you rule the world and some of your employees think they are God's gift to technology and humanity, but when you recruit people for positions, it would behoove you as a company to remind the interviewers of this fact. I think that even if you had offered, I would have declined based upon the experience I had with this final interviewer. I just cannot get over how poorly I was treated given the circumstances. YOU recruited me! Remember that!I'd also note that at no point were salary or benefits ever discussed, and that's kind of a big deal when you're trying to recruit someone for a job in Silicon Valley where housing prices are absolutely insane.",

I didn't have experience in product support, but the role looked mostly analytical so I moved forward.First call with the recruiter, then a call with hiring manager. She wasn't available, so I spoke to someone on a different team who\u2026\u00a0 gave me general info on systems and teams, but not role specific.Onsite interviews included 4x30 minute sessions, 3 being scheduled as video call due to the interviewers being remote. The video calls hurt my performance and added awkwardness because they show you in full body view and were distracting.The team members asked a few technical/analytical questions, and the hiring manager asked vague questions about why I was a good fit and what did the role need to contribute to Sales and Engineering. Having no direct experience, or understanding of why HR put me in for this role, I answered as best I could, but struggled to know what she wanted.The one in-person meeting went well: he asked prioritisation questions with context, and spent an hour with me.Recruiter was brusk about my request to send thank you notes, and in the rejection email basically said the team felt I was sub par in analytical/critical thinking skills. No encouraging note of good will or try again.Frankly, the only analytical questions I was actually asked were on probability and prime numbers, not things that even appropriately relate to the role. No SQL or Excel test, as other reviewers mentioned for this role.The whole process felt disorganised and I got different explanations about the team from each person.

Simple questions you'd expect at basically any interview, with no skills assessment at all - just behavioral questions. At the end of the interview I'd clearly passed\u2026\u00a0 because we went ahead and scheduled the second round (I think this is the general \"perk\" that an internal referral gets you), which was a week and a half later.3. Video conference with a PM and another Product Specialist. Started with a lot of behavioral and why Facebook questions, and then a very short case study exercise. If you brush up on product development, the case study will be a breeze. Obviously I'm under NDA, but at least for my video conference, there were no curveballs. Be prepared to discuss your interaction with other technologies and apps in Facebook-adjacent spaces. Within a few hours of the video conference, the recruiter got back to me and we scheduled the onsite for a week and a half after that.4. Onsite with two Product Specialists and a higher level Manager (above PMs I believe). I had a quick call with the recruiter two days before to talk about logistics and format. Though your recruiter obviously can't tell you much, you should ask as many questions here as possible! The interview was in three distinct parts: the first was about general product and market knowledge, the second was about workflow and problem solving, and the third was behavioral. My best advice is to study the job description line by line. I had no product development experience, but I studied hard for the interview and did well. The interview was tough, though - especially if you don't get a good interviewer, so you're more \"on the spot.\" Have a lot of stories prepared for the behavioral interview, and definitely be sure to ask and think up insightful questions.4.5. Hiring manager phone screen. One of the folks I was supposed to meet with at my onsite wasn't there, so we had a video conference a few days after the onsite. Again, the interview was pretty standard, definitely be prepared to talk about how you fit in with Facebook's mission. The toughie is really the onsite, not this one.5. Reference check. A few days later, the recruiter told me that they would be checking my references and that they planned to make an offer presuming I \"passed\" the reference check.6. Offer.

The initial phonescreen covers typical techbusiness shibboleths, the coding interview was REALLY fun, and I was excited to do the inperson, but that when everything fell apart.For some reason, facebook has decided that at the inperson interview, you have to write your code on a whiteboard, and it can't have any bugs in\u2026\u00a0 it. They even tell you to practice coding on a whiteboard before the interview, because apparently, whiteboard coding is a big part of working at facebook. I'll just go ahead and say it, no one writes software longhand, it's not how it's done, and to expect people to write nontrivial things on a whiteboard in 2015 is beyond ridiculous, especially considering that part of facebook's own process is a code interview where you write a program using a computer!If you're interviewing a lumberjack, do you have him draw a chainsaw on a whiteboard?The most important thing to keep in mind if you want to get a job at facebook is that they reinvent everything. Every question they ask will be about how you would reinvent something. I was unprepared for the amount of guessing I was required to do (I'm terrible at guessing.) Remember when you're answering them that they have basically UNLIMITED RESOURCES and are willing to reinvent any wheel. I'm not saying what they're doing is bad, I'm saying it's completely different than anywhere else I've worked in many years in the business, and I think I'd be working there now if I had approached the questions with that in mind, instead of my instinct, which is to leverage the work of others as much as possible to my advantage, eg I look at what's out there on the internet, and then do whatever I need to. If there's something already there, I use that, if not, I'll write my own, or somewhere inbetween -- like everyone not working at facebook does. Don't blow it like I did, remember it's not a normal job, it's facebook, where there are always hackers hacking, and they have more money than Canada to hire more hackers to hack on whatever they've hacked together.The recruiters are nice, the management seemed friendly and capable, lunch wasn't very good but I was probably just stressed out. If you've ever been to the office when it was Sun Microsystems, be ready for a shock, also the cafeteria was like the mall at xmas.I'd love to work there, and on a different day I may have gotten the gig, but at the end of the day, you've still got to make it through a long gauntlet of bored looking engineers, looking to exclude you.They have unique problems there and it would be a super cool job, so I hope this helps someone else.

I felt confused and upset that Facebook didn't give me a chance for on site.

After few days a recruiter reached out to me telling me that he would like me to interview for another position in data engineering.

It was a very traditional interview, however, the only difference\u2026\u00a0 I would think of is that the interviewer asked technical questions during the screening.The second interview was a coding interview. It was a two phase process of programming and databases. The programming part was easy, the question is actually easier than all I prepared for and I was ready for a lot of data structure questions, my code ran successfully but the interviewer seemed bitter about it even though it ran and I did not understand that.The database part also was easy, however, the interviewer was very unclear while describing the question so it took me about ten minutes to understand what does he want. He kept changing his requirements and giving me distracting information. I told him I need to know what does he want in order to write the code. I got the code running but to be honest I did not get it running immediately, it took me another ten minutes.After that I felt like he personally did not like me even though my code ran with no mistakes. The most horrible part is that I stayed waiting two weeks and then I emailed him back. He told me he does not know the decision and told me to reach out to the recruiter. The recruiter told me he forgot to send me an email that I was rejected.Honestly, that was very unprofessional. For these three reasons:1) When doing a coding interview, you have to expect that the person might make a mistake while writing the code. We are human beings. But if he gets it to work then he knows what he is doing2) When you set a goal for someone and he makes it, please do not tell him he was not good enough. That puts you in a very embarrassing position3) When you do an interview with someone, even if he is not up to your mighty standards. Please tell him that he is not up to your class",

        "details": "I am an experienced engineer. My phone interview was pretty standard. I got through 2 coding questions, and had a great chat with the interviewer. I was called onsite shortly.Onsite I had 5 modules. 3 \"ninja modules\", which are coding based, 1 \"jedi module\" which is behavioral/resume/experience and a small coding problem, and 1 \"pirate module\", which is system design. I've done interviews with Google and LinkedIn as well (and\u2026\u00a0 got offers from both), and the coding problems at Facebook were actually the simplest. I smashed all the coding interviews. The Jedi interview was pretty good too.The place where I failed was the pirate module. If you are interviewing with FB, I cannot stress enough that you really really need to prep system design. I actually failed my design interview spectacularly (they asked me to design a popular feature on FB). But based on my other performances, they decided to call me back the next week for another system design interview. Well, I failed that one too, LOL. Yes, apparently I was that bad at system design.It is strange, because at Google I was specifically told that the system design interview was used to \"slot\" a software engineer only (senior, staff, etc.). i.e. it was not a dealbreaker. For FB, apparently it is a dealbreaker. Personally I think every one has certain strengths and weaknesses. I readily admit that my weakness is system design. My strength is algorithms and coding, and I've actually done pretty well in competitive programming as well. But FB really would prefer to see someone who knows a decent amount about everything, rather than be really good at one thing (algorithms and coding) and not great at another (system design).As far as the interviewers go, they were an amazing bunch. Even when I was bombing the system design module, the interviewer was very respectful, encouraging, and friendly. I walked away with a very positive experience. Everyone was excited to be working there, and I can see that it is a terrific place!If you are interviewing there, my advice is to really read up on many many open source architectures, and thoroughly understand system design. If you clear that module, you will almost certainly get in, the other stuff isn't hard at all.",

Still, interview questions tend to be general enough that, as long as you aren't completely unfamiliar with the language syntax, you can generally do a decent job in any language. So off we went in C++.The interviewer was very pleasant, and even gave me some tips for how to improve my resume at the beginning. Then we dived into the coding. He had actually chosen a great question to determine my programming ability. Unfortunately, I botched it by making too many assumptions about the question and not considering carefully enough what lay behind the interface that the interviewer had provided me.This all happened maybe two or three weeks ago and I am sure that I won't be progressing to the next step. The one negative in all this is that the recruiter has not followed up at all with me. Yes, rejection is not uncommon when applying at a company like Facebook, but that doesn't mean that the company shouldn't have the courtesy to at least inform you of it.So overall, great experience in the beginning but I was turned off by the lack of respect for the process that I sensed from the recruiter.",

Unlike Google (interviewed with them also), Facebook seems to have a smaller question pool as one of the system design questions I got I've also\u2026\u00a0 seen on Glassdoor before.I recommend going through the information recruiters provide for interview preparation. Since Google and Facebook use very similar processes, \"Stevey's Blog Rants: Get that job at Google\" post is also quite relevant and useful. Know your data-structures, algorithms, practice solving problems for a few weeks and you should be in good shape.For system design questions, you will be asked to design Facebook-scale systems. Think data way beyond the scope of one machine, billions of items, thousands of requests per second. Hands on experience with such systems is of course \"the king\". In the absence of that - study distributed NoSQL systems, MapReduce and similar things and you should be in good shape.Overall I was very happy with the on-site interviews and the level of support Facebook recruiters and engineers provided me. This was probably the best interview experience that I've had.Having a competing offer handy will surely help you negotiate better compensation. Facebook seems to have an awesome culture. Deciding to reject their very generous offer for another one wasn't an easy call. One really can't go wrong by joining Facebook.Facebook is the only company that I know that provides interview feedback. Regardless whether you pass or not I recommend asking for it as it will help you get better.",

Invited for\u2026\u00a0 an on campus interview to meet 4 people for 45 minute rounds.. I followed up with the recruiter after this, who said that I was a \u201cfrontrunner\u201d but they didn\u2019t want to move forward with me until they had other candidates they liked (I didn\u2019t even know how to respond to that).Fast forward 3 weeks later, when they said they were ready to move forward with final rounds as well as a web meeting with someone in another office. Final rounds were a little tougher with interviewers trying testing my technical skills. After it was over, the hiring manager stayed behind to tell me more about the role and seemingly wanting me to know that it wasn\u2019t as lateral as I had thought and that there were plenty of opportunities for growth. She totally sold me on this position and I walked out convinced that this could be a good career move. I followed up with the recruiter after three weeks - given the other reviews here, it seems like during the final hour they have a tendency of dropping off the face of the earth. I reached out again to close the loop again after 3 weeks, thinking that if I hadn't heard back it was unlikely I got the offer. Finally heard back that the hiring manager didn't want to move forward with anyone in final rounds - overall, an incredibly frustrating process. If you aren't enthusiastic about me, why string someone along to keep pushing that this is a good position for them? Incredibly frustrating and unprofessional.

The recruiter took quite a bit of time to prep me for the process and was always available to answer any questions. They understood that I had\u2026\u00a0 to work the interviews around my current work schedule, and were accommodating to that end. Everyone really seemed to understand that nerves come into play during interviews, and they all did their best to alleviate any discomfort and stress.The people asked some great questions and gave me ample time to ask my own questions. Every single person seemed to know how to do their job well and exuded a sense of confidence. With each interview, I felt like they wanted to know me as a professional and wanted to see how I would fit in with their team. At no point did I feel like any question was a pass/fail situation.Facebook is, of course, a technology company. There were some technical questions, and some of them were rather intense. You knew the answers or how to reason them out, or you didn't. I missed a couple of questions, and I do not feel that those missed questions negatively impacted me. Most of the interviewers said that they would prefer for the interview to be in conversation format. In every case, that's exactly what happened.I realized in the last couple of interviews that the position I interviewed for may not be the right fit for me. It seems Facebook agreed as they did not move forward after the on-site interview. They gave me a call after about a week and let me know what they liked and gave me the opportunity to ask any final questions.I still want to work for Facebook. The energy and passion is obvious as you walk around the campus, and I want to be a part of that. I wanted to be a part of their team before the interviews, but the interview process really solidified my interest. I'll be watching for a position that may be a better fit and apply again.

I chose the in-person option, and got an\u2026\u00a0 invite for a round of full day (5 total) within few hours after the initial screen.Facebook recruiters send interview prep materials to the candidates on what to expect, what to brush up on, as well as some suggestions tailored to a particular candidate's weak-ish spots (in my case it was the speed of coding). I knew what to expect going in and felt well prepared on this front.Initial screen was algorithm + coding. Nothing overly challenging.Onsite consisted of 5 interviews (+ informal lunch) covering:1) One \"Jedi\" interview with a hiring manager testing behavior / culture fit + warm-up coding. Prepare to talk about past experience, career goals, as well as several \"tell me about the time when...\" questions.2) One \"Pirate\" interview: System design portion of the interview. There are great resources on Quora on suggestions on how to prepare and what to pay attention too.3) Three \"Ninja\" interviews focusing on algorithm + coding. I actually have seen all of the questions I got asked at Facebook before, but that did not help me as ultimately the reason for rejection was cited as not being able to come up with optimal solutions and code fast enough.Got an phone call from the recruiter in about a week+few days after the interview telling me the unfortunate news. I think I had to wait few extra days because of the July holidays and typically the process is faster.Culture: I did find some of the junior Facebook engineers conducting my interview a bit arrogant and cocky, but nothing too alarming.All in all, I had a positive interview experience. I wish the interview loop was better tailored towards someone more senior, e.g. less emphasis on coding, more on design. Current interview process makes it seem they hire code monkeys.",

Three days later, I found out I'd moved on to the next stage.Two weeks later, I had a 50-minute Skype interview that was based on behavioral questions, more about my research, and a few curveball questions that make you think much more deeply about research and methodology. I found out that day that I'd moved on to the last stage.Two weeks after that, Facebook flew me out for an on-site interview. Keeping this as vague as possible, I will say that they were so incredibly gracious and did so much to make sure I had a good experience (it would be hard not to!). Everyone I met was awesome, the campus is fantastic, and everything was incredibly efficient.

It really comes down to how much you prepare yourself mentally to code within the context of an interview, and how much you study Career Cups as well as the other resources given to you\u2026\u00a0 by the recruiter. Sadly, you don't have to be a great developer at all.What's interesting is that none of these skills have been necessary during my 17 years of real world experience. I never had to write code on a whiteboard (except for other interviews) and I don't see how \"writing code fast\" should be considered a measurement of someone's productivity and code quality. That sort of thinking seems naive and haphazard to me.What frightens me is that I think Facebook truly believes they're \"raising the bar\" with this system. But they're not always hiring good people, and they're probably turning down a lot of great folks.The coding tests were super easy. Two were questions I've actually asked myself while conducting interviews for another company which was aimed towards entry level developers. I really wish they would have asked more challenging questions. I was able to finish them before the end of each panel, and with optimal solution.The design question they gave me actually aligned with something I developed and designed for a product used by millions. I felt good with how everything went at the end of the day, but somehow I failed at *both* coding and design. Interesting... whatever.Two of my friends--whom of which I mentored at my last company--were able to get offers at Facebook (same office, same interview process) but they were *not* the best coders nor the top performers, so if you get turned down at Facebook, don't take it seriously. They say there is some \"randomness\" in the interview, but it just seems strange that common sense didn't kick anywhere to question the obvious, or just the fact I was interviewed by a few people with only 5 years experience. Smart, but inexperienced (and somewhat arrogant) wanting to judge you with entry level coding questions.Half of the people that interviewed me didn't go through the interview process themselves. They were brought in by acquisitions. Specifically for a product that isn't doing very well right now.I was excited about the idea of working there initially, but after the interview, I wasn't so sure anyway. They do try to put a lot of emphasis on finding great developers, but many of the folks who interviewed me mentioned the codebase was a mess (probably from writing code so quickly and not thinking through it) And their open office (no cubes, no walls, just wires and computers everywhere) is a bit distracting. Not something genuinely appreciated by the people working there who used to have their own office. When you need to focus and get quality work done, there are only so many dedicated rooms to use and they're usually taken.Coupled with the fact that they're Seattle office is located in one of the worst traffic areas, I wasn't so sure I would have accepted anyway.",

I cleared this easily.Facebook's on-site interview process is far more rigorous, though. Each 45-min interview has a clearly defined role, intended to test you from multiple different angles. Specifically, I went through:- 2 \"Ninja\" interviews (coding & algorithms)- 2 \"Pirate\" interviews (system design)- 1\u2026\u00a0 \"Jedi\" interview (behavioral & simple coding)plus lunch with a Facebook engineer.The \"Ninja\" and \"Jedi\" interviews were straightforward. I hadn't seen the coding questions before, but they were not particularly hard. I would rate them as being of just average difficulty, pretty similar to the whiteboard coding questions asked at most other major Silicon Valley tech companies. And the behavioral section of the \"Jedi\" interview was just a friendly chat about my resume and my past experiences.However, the \"Pirate\" interviews were what killed me. Both \"Pirate\" interviews involved being asked to propose and discuss a design for existing features on Facebook. The interviewers were extremely meticulous and questioned me on virtually every last detail of my design decisions. In particular, they focused a lot on how huge datasets should be stored and accessed to support extremely large-scale distributed systems. Even though I am already working on web-scale systems in my current job, I was nonetheless still way under-prepared for this level of technical challenge and scrutiny.My advice to all prospective candidates is to spend most of your time preparing for the \"Pirate\" interviews. The coding questions aren't hard, but the system design questions will likely stretch you to your limit! (Unless you're a fresh grad--they don't ask \"Pirate\" questions to fresh grads. Lucky folks!)Additional side note: interestingly, my Facebook recruiter actually gave me detailed post-mortem feedback on each and every one of my interviews. They are the only major Silicon Valley company I know that does this, so major kudos to them for being so considerate.",

They want bug free code and will only go forward with the best candidate. I think even if you do a minor mistake you are out as there is someone else who will solve it perfectly so try to solve it perfectly :)Another important lesson is if you get option of phone v/s in person interview, I will say go for in person interview as it gives the interviewer the chance to see what you are doing on paper verses imagining that over phone.",

        "details": "A recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn. I had a quick call with her to confirm my interest and then she set me up with a technical phone screen that same week. Because I did okay, not great, I had a second phone screen the following week. Then within another week or two I went in for an onsite interview with 5 different team members ranging from analyst to\u2026\u00a0 manager. The interview was on a Friday and by Tuesday, I believe, they had gotten back to me with a no - but they softened the blow by letting me know that I was a good fit, but that my technical skills weren't quite there, so I should give them a call back in 6 months or when they are there, whichever comes last.Overall the people I interviewed with were very cool and supportive (one exception, but there always is, isn't there?) In the end, I don't actually think I was qualified for the position, but had I been, I most likely would have taken the role. The only negative for me really was the workspace - the entire office is one room.Both phone screens were the same format. They start by telling you about the role, ask you to describe your experience and then they jump right into a case, which also serves as a SQL exercise. They provide you with a sample schema then ask you to write queries against it and answer some strategic questions about how you might think about the output or what conclusions you could draw from the metrics available to you (or those you might create.) Overall for someone who uses SQL regularly (which I do) this was very easy - though I will say if you are not familiar with the format, where you code live (which I wasn't) it can throw you off. All of the queries I saw in the phone screen and the onsite interview relied a lot on COUNT and self joins and other nested queries, so if you feel you might be nervous you could review those concepts.I was really happy with the onsite interview, it was even a little bit fun, but I really didn't know what I was doing half the time, so that was a bit awkward. What I liked the most was that it was almost 100% skill based, none of the \"tell me about a time when\" or \"what's your greatest strength\" nonsense that I'm used to.The first interview was a business case. I was asked what kind of metrics I would look at, how I would track them, what conclusions I might draw from different scenarios. It was basic, but they were looking for some specific insights so I would say even though it was open ended, there were right and wrong answers.The next interview was a SQL interview. It was a lot like the phone screen, just more involved.The following interview was Python/R based and asked me to write a couple of algorithms. I don't actually know Python/R so I did pretty badly! But it's a testament to the culture (or at least the kindness of this one guy) that he was not rude about it, just tried to give me some coaching and be friendly while I wrote a lot of non-sensical things on the whiteboard. Since then I have taken Coursera's R Programming course and I would say that if you pass that class you should be able to pass this interview - though perhaps if you fly through the first couple of algorithms they get progressively harder in which case the class may not be sufficient.The next interview was a probability question. I had done a ton of probability prep based on the reviews I saw on Glassdoor but he really knocked me over with a question that I had no idea how to answer. Bayes rule what? That was not at all relevant in this case, sadly.The final interview was another case, or so it seemed, but actually I think it was more of a test of my stats 101 knowledge, which I didn't quite pick up on right away. The interviewer asked me a kind of confusing question which I thought was a bit of an analysis question, but really he was asking me: \"what is standard deviation?\" but in the most round about, muddled way possible. He also had a thick accent and was very stern which didn't help. So I actually think I did the worst on this (even worse than the Python/R which I didn't even know!), which is funny because I know stats very well, but that's how it goes.Overall I would say I was very unfamiliar with this style of interview. I have an MBA so I had done a lot of less technical interview prep. However it seemed very fair and very manageable... if you actually know the material.",

Execution - Was asked a bunch of hypothetical questions \"How would you double group joins in 3mo if we gave you a team of 5 engineers.\" Stress here that you are data driven, use cohort analysis and break users up to prioritize different strategies.On Campus Interviews:(These interview orders vary by candidate so the exact order may be different)1. Execution - You will be asked how you get things done when you don't have ample resources. You'll be asked to solve a problem you don't understand. Hint: Ask clarifying questions! Show that you are a doer and understand how to prioritize multiple approaches.2. Leadership - What they really want to see here is how you interact with people. You should talk about a time when you inspired a group to do something. You should think through how you would handle all types of conflicts.3. Product Sense - This interview has the most variation across candidates. You will definitely be asked about a product you like similar to your phone interview. Beyond that the interviewer might ask you anything from a hypothetical feature question to a very specific design scenario they ended up in through their position. Try to stress here that you are empathetic toward users, and aren't afraid to admit when you don't know something.",

An engineer came in and for a minute\u2026\u00a0 or two asked me about my background and work experience. Then went and asked me two technical questions. The first one was pretty straight forward, but I spent a long time explaining my thought process and debugging and everything. (As a ton of sites say you do). Second one was a bit more of a puzzle question and stumbled a little on it, basically it was a binary search algorithm. Unfortunately a miscommunication at the beginning of the question caused me to try to think of it in a different direction, but eventually got it and realized time was up so I quickly coded the solution and debugged it, but didn't explain myself probably because I knew the time was up.Ultimately got both questions right with a minor stumble and then was not asked for a further interview, so I really have no idea why, and unfortunately I understand for legal ramifications why they can't tell me.

I don't remember signing any NDA at this point so, the questions were k-Nearest Points to Origin, finding a substring, and 3-sum.On-site interview: 3 interviews, 45 mins each. 1st interview: 2 coding questions. 2nd interview: behavioral questions (about team conflict, etc.) and a coding question. 3rd interview: 2 coding questions. Coding questions were easy and required *no knowledge* of special algorithms or data structures (such as graphs, DP, trees, etc). Recursion and strings were common.I did not get an offer from Facebook; however, I received offers from other companies. The interview questions themselves were considerably easier at Facebook than those asked at Google, LinkedIn, MS, Amazon, etc.Since the questions are not very hard, my guess is the decision is based upon fit and most importantly how *quickly* you were able to arrive at your solution and how *perfect* your code was. Make sure you focus and are confident.Advice: practice the easier questions and practice coding them. Also, looking at some of the other experiences on Glassdoor, it looks like a majority of the questions are re-used.",

Afterward, I was told that I had passed and\u2026\u00a0 would have one coding interview and one system interview before making the final decision.The coding interview started about 1 weeks later. I was asked to code using stypi and there are two questions in 45 minutes. One is translate English to \"Goat Latin\" language with a set of predefined rules. It was not hard but I still spent 20-30 minutes on that, partly because I cared too much about the detail. The second question is more a shell-script coding, although I did not realize it immediately. I was asked to obfuscate local parts of email addresses found in all HTML files under a folder (also subfolders). Due to the time limit, I did not write a clean and complete code for it. But I discussed with the interviewers for the possible solutions (shell script + python regex operation).Then the recruiter told me I passes the first round and we moved on to system interview, which began 5 days later. Since it is totally new to me, I read lots of posts in glassdoor and other interviewing forums and there are very useful. The interview questions requires solid knowledge about Linux, operating system, performance monitoring. They both starts with a relatively simple questions but ends with lots of followup questions. Try your best to be open-minded and always talk with the interviewer. They want not only an correct answer, but also how you get this solution.Later that day I heard from the recruiter that the feedback seemed also great. After one week, they give me the offer.

The process started in Seattle and I opted for a in-person onsite interview for the screening round (they have this option for locals in Seattle/California).The interview went well i.e. I figured out how to solve the question in optimal time and space complexity. I made some mistakes here and there while writing the solution down but the interviewer didn't seem to mind. Contrary to what I had heard, he wasn't too anal about syntax (also helped that I write in C# he wasn't very familiar with it)Onsite Round:I received an email from the recruiter that they wanted to move forward and call me onsite. I was like, cool!I took around 2 weeks to prepare and also tried to do design questions. I felt a bit under prepared around design and tried to make up for it in the last few weeks by watching videos around cloud architecture (and open source stuff like Hadoop, Kafka and Storm).Onsite was pretty straightforward. First round was a career fit/discussion and I did pretty well (I think). It was mainly some behavioral questions and a lot diagrams around the architecture in my current and previous projects.Second round was the one that I messed up.The question was around designing an existing Facebook feature (as a hint, think about the various add-dons you see on FB and instagram like Chat, Search, latest friend related news or popular links). When you really dig into designing this feature, its quite complicated and requires a reasonable amount of knowledge around distributed data storage etc. etc.You need to nail this round to get into Facebook (in my personal opinion). I'm guessing they will adjust their expectations based on your years of experience.There was a lunch which was informal and two more coding rounds where they asked questions that were very similar to the ones I had practiced. I made some silly mistakes here and there but again (due to practice) came up with optimal time/space complexity answers.Got my result exactly one week from the my onsite date. No offer.

She described the position she was considering me for and asked me whether I am interested. I said yes and emailed her my availability for next week. Soon I was scheduled for a phone interview.The phone interview was rather simple. However, the questions are not well thought. For example, he asked to write\u2026\u00a0 a query that a certain text field has text. It turned out he is testing for \u2018 column like \u2018%%\u2019. I am sure there is a lot ways of testing whether I know the SQL keyword \u201clike\u201d. Maybe it is a English issue. Since I had some experience with Facebook\u2019s direct competitor, I felt like the interviewer is more interested in details of how things are running at the competitor rather than in my abilities.I got email from the recruiter the next morning about on-site interview with 5 different people \u2013 1 data scientist, 1 from another group, 1 hiring manager, 2 direct reports of current hiring manager. I can tell that the group is extremely un-diversified in every sense, and all from eBay/PayPal. I spent 10+ years in Silicon Valley already and I know this is not a good sign. My later interviews approved every bit of my suspicions.The data scientist only asked me SQL questions for table join and case statements. The interviewer from a different group asked me \u201cWe are going to release a new product. What\u2019s your test plan?\u201d I asked back about the goal and metrics of the testing, she repeated her question again \u201chow are you going to test?\u201d Obviously the questions are either not well prepared or misleading. The hiring manager thought I was a different person, and never read my resume at all. He asked me to walk through my resume. One of his subordinates does not know what rank() function does and kept asking me about it. The other subordinate kept asking me every single bit of details of Facebook competitor operations.In general, the interviewers are not well trained.I followed up with recruiter 2 days later (she said she will have answers in 2 days before) and she said that it is extremely difficult decision. I answered all technical and specific questions very well, but not for open questions. It is very bizarre because I analyzed every \u201copen\u201d question from every angle. Open questions are their weapons to weed out candidates that are not of their types. Obviously open questions are used to cover other excuses or otherwise illegal reasons for rejections.Overall, there is no common understanding between recruiter and hiring teams. There is no proper communication channel between phone interviewer and hiring manager. Totally waste of time and energy.",

I was expected to know the solution and code it in 10 minutes which pretty much negated the problem solving aspect of it.The 2 coding round questions were pretty standard. However, one of the questions was a text book question and I stated that I knew the solution to that question following which the question asked was way too tough to be solved in 25 minutes on the white board.Similarly the design interview involved a lot of math and was more difficult than coming up with an architecture . This had been informed prior to the interview though.Overall : The interview experience was mixed probably because most of the questions seemed to be the type of questions that one would/ wouldn't know.

But for a software\u2026\u00a0 engineer (not senior), the question was pretty hard to solve in 40 minutes. Backtracking was required and the best solution to the problem is n! (n factorial). So if you haven't heard of the problem before, it is quite likely you will spend time just on finding an optimal solution before jumping to code. That's what I did. However, I was able to code most of the solution and interviewer seemed happy. He himself told me that.Interviewer was pretty nice. He answered my questions pretty well and seemed down to earth, only thing I am not sure is the choice of question.

There was a little bit of time for other questions, but the focus was entirely on coding ability.A few days later, the\u2026\u00a0 recruiter contacted me again and arranged for an on site interview in Seattle. I had four approximately hour long interviews with a shorter lunch interview part of the way through. Although the interviews were themed (e.g., \"pirate\", \"ninja\", etc.), all were very focused on coding except for one which focused on architecting a system.Several of the coding questions required figuring out the trick underlying the problem in order to get a good solution quickly. Many other companies have stopped asking these kinds of questions since they've found they are not very good at identifying the best people to hire. I felt like I reached satisfactory solutions for each of the questions, but based on feedback I received from the recruiter afterward it was clear they would have preferred me to have been faster.Everybody I interviewed with was friendly and fairly organized, but the sole emphasis on coding and problem solving questions turned me off to the interview process. While it's important to suss out a candidate's technical abilities, these questions don't do a very good job of that. Moreover, they completely ignore other qualities a senior engineer needs to succeed such as cultural fit, leadership abilities, ability to motivate/influence others, having vision, etc. Overall it felt like the process was overly tailored towards entry level college hires instead of mid-career professionals with existing experience.I did not get an offer, but would not have accepted anyways.",

There were 5 interviews, one initial chat to warm up, talking about past experience, working relationships, etc, and a brief coding question on the whiteboard.There were 3 more technical interviews of same format as the initial phone interviews. Plus one interview on designing scalable iOS app architecture for a simple app.I really enjoyed the process and found the recruiters very helpful and friendly. Going and visiting Facebook HQ was great and as the reviews say all the people were great. Recommend doing for the experience. Getting an offer is tough. For me it came down to not being quick enough in answering the questions in the onsite technical interviews. They weren't overly difficult but they want you to move fast, and I tended to take my time and discuss with the interviewers which I believe worked against me. The other aspect was a general lack of experience (I have 18 months experience), and this reflected especially in the iOS design interview.Hope this helps others considering going through the process!

The first question came and went very quickly, though I did have some difficulty understanding the interviewer as English was not\u2026\u00a0 their first language. The second question also went by very quickly, though the interviewer kept hitting on what happens when a float is cast to/from a boolean in Python and ultimately, I suspect this is what put the interviewer against me.Overall, the questions asked were fair and weren\u2019t unnecessarily complicated.The time from the phone screen to rejection was six days and the rejection message was the standard condescending boilerplate of, \"We've found stronger candidates for this particular position,\" leaving me with no idea what I had done wrong and only my suspicions. Followup e-mails to figure out where I fell short were met with silence.The job posting had the following verbiage on it; \"Our team is comprised of varying levels of experience and backgrounds, from new grads to industry veterans. Relevant industry experience is important, but ultimately less so than your demonstrated abilities and attitude. We sail into uncharted waters every day at Facebook in Production Engineering, and we are always learning.\"For a position that demands such a broad range of skills, I find it silly that what (I suspect, anyway) did me in was something that in a real-world situation, I could've just opened an interactive Python interpreter and entered a few of lines to prove / disprove the expected behavior. So much for \"we are always learning.\"Pros:- Recruiter was friendly and was on top of things.- Decision was made quickly.- Interview questions were fair.Cons:- Interviewer dinged me for trivial things.- Coding interview did not reflect the broad knowledge required for the role.- Interview did not jive with the ethos of, \"we are always learning.\"- I had some trouble understanding the interviewer and I suspect they also had trouble understanding me.- Standard condescending rejection boilerplate with followup e-mails routed to /dev/null.",

Two programming questions one on link list and other on BST. For each involved finding the solution (easy to optimal) and then write code optimal solution. I did this pretty well as I had prepared for data structures and algos.They immediately called me for full day onsite interview. Again I prepared lot on data structures, algorithms and related problem solving. And boom..that was my mistake. I forgot to focus on system side (locking, synchronization, deadlock) in detail. 5 interviewers, 45 min each. No on asked on data structures/algo.

The one part I knew I was weak in, and which the interview process corroborated, was the system design part. There are not too many resources to help prepare you for this, and this cannot be built up through preparation alone, you need to have been working in a lot of software projects, or better still, worked as an engineer to answer these questions well. I was sent in for a follow-up design interview on the phone after the on-site, and ultimately rejected.I don't have much to say. The coding questions are very standard. They're probably easier than they were earlier, and this again reflects the size of the company. The engineers I talked to seemed happy at Facebook, although the hacker culture, the quick and dirty way of doing things and the general focus around pushing stuff to production turned me off a little.

        "details": "I was contacted by a recruiter, I came onsite for an initial screen.I thought the interviewer was very nice, and the question was reasonable. However, the frustrating part for me was that for the given question, there were a few different ways to solve it.From my perspective, it seemed that the approach I used to solve the question was not what the interviewer had in mind. I understand that you\u2026\u00a0 should listen to an interviewer when they interrupt you or give you hints, but to me it seemed like the \"hints\" were basically from the perspective of \"you're not solving this the way I would solve it, even though both of our solutions are O(n)\".The result was that I was basically having to write out a problem on a white board and constantly have my train of thought interrupted. The interruptions were unnecessary, and I had to clarify to the interviewer that my intent would indeed work. Example interruption:Interviewer: \"That array index is giving you the same result as the other value\"Me: \"No, that's a different variable name\"Interviewer: \"Oh, oops. Continue\"orInterviewer: \"Wait, why are you replacing the for loop with a while loop?\"Me: \"Because I want to be able to manipulate the cursor directly\"Interviewer: \"Oh, ok. Continue\"In the above statement, it's clear that the usual method of solving the problem did not involve a while loop (but it could be done to solve the problem). After my solution, the interviewer explained the most straightforward solution to the problem which basically leveraged the constraints of the problem itself, and after seeing that then of course the problem was trivial to implement.So to me, it seemed like the question was more of a riddle than a coding exercise, which I believe to be a bad interview question, and at my current company it's accepted as the WORST type of interview question.It was rather embarrassing for me to be turned down, especially on just the initial screen, but another qualm I had was that screens are generally meant to filter out candidates that can't code at all, not candidates who are questionable in their skills (from my perspective my skills aren't questionable, but clearly I did not give my best performance in this screen).To me it felt as though the interviewer in this case did not have much experience. While I was answering the questions that were given to me, I was having to explain a few quirks to the python language that the interviewer clearly did not know i.e. \"Oh, I didn't know you could compare dictionaries like that\". For that to be said, I can only infer that the ONLY thing this interviewer was looking for is if I answer the question that was given to me in the exact way they wanted it solved.",

I thought I had very engaging conversation with all of them but something went wrong as during the follow-up call Recruiter mentioned that they are going to move forward with an offer with another candidate and my skills doesn't seem to be inline with the requirements of the role.Overall it was a great experience. Recruiters are really professional and kept me posted about progress on each and every single stage. They even provided some inputs in terms of what to expect during interviews. The only thing which could have been better was being very specific about what they actually want in an ideal candidate but given this was a unique role, it is very difficult for them to outline exact requirements.I admire the company and individuals I met.

The coding question was not difficult, but clearly not an easy one, requires some thoughts. Be prepared to provide test cases. I had it working but not covering many edge cases. At the end, you can ask the interviewer any question, which I did. It sounded like the interviewer didn't seem to be excited about the current work, but kind enough to give me details about the challenging parts and current interesting problems the interviewer has been working on. I heard back the interview result from the recruiter exactly one week after.",

However, after discussing the space and time complexity for my potential solution, my interviewer asked me if I saw any draw-backs to my algorithm. I told him that it used a lot of extra space, and he asked if I could think of a more efficient (space-wise) solution. I thought about it for awhile, but unfortunately blanked out.

Coded it up with some minor corrections (since I was white boarding and you miss some stuff when you're face is glued to a wall). He then extended the question but cut me off because we ran out of time (this was completely his fault since he showed up a good 15 minutes late).They proceeded to give me a tour of the campus and talk with current engineers. It would have been fun if it hadn't been for the bad interview. Overall, I got the feeling that they're a large company and are definitely not as agile as they were a couple of years ago.

Later in the call the recruiter mentioned she will need my resume and they want me to do Hardware Practical Test. I agreedI took me a few days to get my resume ready during which I was pinged by the recruiter to make sure I am still in business. I thought it is a good sign and that they want to move fast. After few days I sent the resume and we scheduled the Hardware Practical. The format of the Hardware Piratical is that they send it to you over email and you should reply with a solution within an hour. See the exact monostable circuit question below.I fully and timely solved the Hardware Practical. I tested my solution in circuit simulator. I documented my solution. I printed it out and verified that it meets the requirements. After sending the solution I have not heard from them for a week. It was surprising as it is probably a question they have sent out many times so they should be able to check it quickly. It is not like the final go hiring decision. In between the recruiter called me and asked me some more questions , how you troubleshoot a signal integrity issue and what interfaces are you familiar with DDR, PCIe, SATA ect....I always feel awkward when the recruiter is asking me technical questions. Especially open ended ones. Can we really develop technical discussion there or do I need to match some pattern that Facebook Engineer gave to this recruiter?After a week I got an email that I am not a fit. It was surprising as I am very confident about the Hardware Practical solution. She also did not provide any clue as to why I am not a fit, over qualified? Not relevant experience? Hardware Practical? Something else?Overall experience is negative. I would expect Facebook to be more open, professional and prompt in their communication with candidates.

As with pretty well everywhere, expect to also give a big-O estimate of the run time, and find some failure cases (or at least explain where you're already handling it.)The design interview question was tailored to some specialized work I've done and the particular is probably not representative of most groups; as I understand it, everyone gets some level of design interview and it's usually roughly some form of \"how would you build this part of an app like ours for our scale.\"Got my offer a few days after interviewing.

        "role": "Software Engineering Intern",
        "details": "I originally had applied to Facebook through their online portal. After a few weeks of no response I reached out to a recruiter at a Facebook event and she saw my resume. After I convinced her I was ready for the interviews, she set up my first phone interview of three total.After the interviewer gave a fairly long intro of his bg I was asked several behavioral questions. I was\u2026\u00a0 asked why I picked Facebook, what is my field of interest, and had to discuss a project of mine.At this point we reached the technical portion. He asked me the following question.Q: Given a number n, return a number formed from the same digits of n that is the number right before n. Example: Given 1342, you must return the number 1324.After this we spent a fairly lengthy period of time talking about coding habits, facebook, push cycles, and other production related questions I asked.At the end of this interview I felt terrible, I thought I'd completely failed it because I only answered one question. I couldn't sleep all night, but then the next day itself I received an e-mail saying I'd passed to the second round. They asked if I wanted some time to brush up before going in for my final interview. I asked for a week and prepared.My second interviewer called from a conference room due to which the sound quality was a bit off. We talked and she asked me a few similar questions to the first interviewer delving into my background, projects, and my schoolwork. Eventually we began the coding questions.The first question was the LCA problem with no parent pointers. I immediately started analyzing the problem's base cases for recursion, determined an optimum algorithm that covered all cases, and wrote the solution before coding. After explaining it and running through test examples I began coding the solution. After coding it, I spent a fair amount of time proving my code works with the interviewer before she accepted it worked. We had approximately 15 minutes left at this point so he said we can begin another problem before ending five minutes early, a statement I was confused by.The second question was to design a method to store really large numbers that exceed 64 bits, and then to write a method that can add two of these numbers. I began coding and had just finished the code when he said we ran out of time. He asked me about any questions I had and seemed to be in a hurry so I asked a few questions then the interview ended.At this point I waited for approximately 2 weeks after I sent two emails to my recruiter asking about the feedback from the interview. I was asked to do a third phone interview with a product team member as the engineers had noted I was interested in product development. I was a bit confused but happy overall to still be in the running. We scheduled it for a few days later and I went in relaxed.In the interview, I was asked why Facebook, a project of mine, which field I'm interested in and why, followed by a technical question. I coded in Java although she mentioned she hadn't used Java in a while so she didn't care as much about the syntax.The first question was the classic anagram question. I described two solutions, one using a HashTable and one relying on bucketsort. I coded both methods and did a complexity analysis before she expanded the problem. Now rather than checking if two strings were anagrams, I had to group a list of strings by anagram grouping. I described how we could use a Hashtable to store the sorted string as a key, and have the original string be contained in the value as a linked lists. After writing the algorithm out in pseudocode she said I didn't have to implement it in Java and that she believed it would work. After a complexity analysis she then asked me this mix of behavioral technical questions.What would you do if Mark Zuckerberg came to your desk and told you Facebook was slow and he wanted you to fix it.She then asked me to describe a product I'd design if I worked at Facebook. I mentioned several related to data analytical tools for Facebook users on their own data. I mentioned the benefit to users before naming another idea involving querying newsfeed for posts related to the topics described in the query.After this she asked me if I had any questions for her before she told me that my recruiter would get back to me within a week. I waited three days before I received an e-mail from my recruiter that she wanted to talk for a few minutes if I had time. I immediately responded I was free and she called me shortly after.She then gave me my offer for an internship in Menlo Park, described the components of the compensation, and explained briefly the process involved with the internship. Afterwards she asked me if I had any questions. I was too blown away so I just said I'd email her once I think of questions before we ended the call. I accepted that night.",

        "details": "A recruiter contacted me. After confirming that I would like to interview for the position, I was asked basic questions around networking, Linux system administration, and programming. A graduating Computer Science student should expect to pass this with little difficulty.Next was a phone interview for programming. I was asked to take input text and identify the unique words in the text and how many times each word occurred. Edge cases\u2026\u00a0 were important as was the performance. Interviewer asked for an analysis of the run-time and memory usage. Any second-year CS student should have no problem completing this in far less than the allocated time.Next was a phone interview for systems administration. I was given the bare minimum information possible about a system and told to describe how I discover running services and potential issues. As I progressed, the interviewer gave me information reasonable based on my descriptions and identified when I had correctly discovered a problem or possible problem. In investigating problems, it was important to be specific about why the problem was occurring and how to address the issue. When addressing problems, the performance, scalability, and maintainability of the solution was very important. Be prepared to identify how a file system is mounted or if it's local, and be prepared to encounter a single central share mounted by many servers with active read/write activity from them all. This will be difficult for anyone without good real-world Linux systems administration experience.Next I was flown out to HQ for a series of on-site interviews. A manager spoke to me to gauge my understanding of Facebook and the Production Engineering position (rely on the job description and don't be afraid to ask your recruiter lots of questions!) and to get to know me.There's another interview about coding and another one for systems administration. Both are along the same lines as the phone interview, but more in-depth and more difficult.There's a systems design interview, where you'll be given a target and asked to design a scalable and performant system to accomplish the goal. You may be asked to analyze the storage requirements (core and/or persistent) and network requirements of your system.The last interview type is a networking interview, which is very in-depth and requires extensive knowledge of TCP/IP, UDP/IP, DNS, etc. Essentially, start at a command prompt and think of what happens when you type \"telnet www.facebook.com 80\" - be prepared to talk about almost every single network-related thing that happens at all seven OSI layers. Know your packet layouts!Throughout the entire process, my recruiter was always on top of keeping me informed and always answered questions very quickly (I rarely waited even most of a day for a reply). I rarely needed to ask anything about what to expect because she kept me so well informed. Don't worry too much about thinking at Facebook's scale, they understand that very few people have worked on anything even approaching their size and scale. Everyone you deal with will work hard to make things go as smoothly as it can.",

        "details": "Facebook gave me a verbal offer and then took it back.1. I was initially contacted by an FB recruiter to have a phone interview where we discussed typical experience questions.2. I was then brought in-house to interview with the GSM finance team (the hiring manager and direct reports). I enjoyed meeting the team as everyone was friendly and seemed like people I wanted to work with. The questions covered FP&A,\u2026\u00a0 experience, and situations.3. I then made it to the next and final round which was with two finance directors. The questions were mainly high level (e.g. where do you want to be in five years, what project are you most proud of, etc.).4. Several days later, the recruiter called me and told me I got the job! During the call she asked me if I would take the job as we had just gone through weeks of interviews and FB needed someone to take the job. Obviously, I said yes, basically committing myself to FB (I had told the recruiter I had interviews scheduled with other companies, but said I was going to cancel them because I wanted FB). She then proceeded to talk to me about my compensation requirements and asked for two references. Over the next several days she spoke to my references, which the recruiter later told me went well.5. I wait several days thinking they are putting the offer together. After not hearing anything I contact the recruiter. She tells me that the hiring manager quit out of the blue and that they won't be able to make me a formal offer because the hiring manager's boss doesn't want me to start without a manager in place. This didn't make sense to me. Why not just have me start and learn from the team until a new manager is in place? Or why not tell me I can start once they hire a new manager? Also, when hiring someone you aren't hiring the person solely for the role but because he/she is good for the company and will add value in the long-term, so why take back a verbal offer and why not just let me start? This was an extremely frustrating experience because I had essentially committed to FB once they made me the verbal offer, but apparently FB didn't commit to me. After getting the verbal offer, I also canceled interviews with other companies, told numerous people (family, friends, coworkers) that I got a new job, and even had a celebratory dinner with my friends.6. FB then wasted my time again by letting me interview for another finance role several weeks later, which I knew wasn't a fit with my experience and knew I wasn't going to get. I ultimately never made it past the first round.This is feedback on Facebook's recruiting and hiring process. If you make a verbal offer, stick to it. FB may think that a verbal offer is not the same as a formal offer obviously, but in my years of experience as long as the candidate has a good reference check, which I did, the high high majority of the time, a verbal offer turns into a formal offer. And at least personally apologize for putting a candidate through this process instead of sending a generic rejection email.7. To top it off, I recently learned that the FB recruiter that I had been working with used my name to connect with my friend that works at another company to try to get a strong candidate (that had interviewed at FB but ultimately didn't get the role) who was interested in a finance role at my friend's company, a referral for the role. I guess the FB recruiter wanted to help this person out because FB felt bad that they couldn't give this person an offer at FB.To all reading I just want to let you know that this is what went down for me while recruiting with Facebook.",

I answered enough of the screening questions correctly and we scheduled a 1:1 interview. The recruiter sent me an email full of links to prepare for the interview. She also told me to look on Glassdoor for interview questions. Some of the email links were broken, and only a few of the resources/reviews proved to be very helpful.I attended the conference, which was just a few hours long, and had a 1:1 interview the next day. The interview was scheduled to be only 45 minutes, and we basically went straight into technical questions. There was only time for 2 questions and they involved writing code in a text editor that had code completion, it wasn't Xcode and was a little awkward to use. The questions were somewhat difficult, and would either require memorization of the Foundation framework or you would have had to have implemented that code recently in a real application to answer correctly. After that, there was a whole 3 minutes for any questions that I had before I was hurried off and the next candidate was processed.After the interview, I spoke with the recruiter briefly about how it went, and immediately knew there would be some somber news coming. The recruiter scheduled a follow-up and called me back later the next week (15 minutes late) to give me the feedback from the interviewer. The feedback was not constructive, or helpful in any way. In fact, it didn't seem like any thought was put into it at all.

I have to stress that I really though I aced this interview. The recruiter told me she'd pass my resume on to a local hiring manager, who would be in touch to schedule a second round. About a week later, I got a note from the recruiter informing me that Facebook had decided not to move forward with my candidacy, and inviting me to apply again later.

Apparently something had come up and one interviewer was replaced with someone that wasn't originally indicated in my email. The first two interviews went really well and was very comfortable. It was\u2026\u00a0 a nice easy conversation interview where they asked me situational questions and I replied with my job experience or what I would do in such a situation. Both interviewers seemed quite satisfied with my answers and kept praising me at how well I answered the questions. It wasn't until the last interviewer came in that completely changed the mood of the interview. First off, she was late. Second, she didn't introduce her self and just slammed all her personal belongings on the conference room table. Third, she barked instructions at me like rapid gun fire and when I asked her to repeat her question, she looked at me like I was inferior to her. While I worked on the task she gave me, she paid no attention to my work and stared at her phone. When she believed too much time had passed, she said, \"Okay, do you have any questions for me?\" It was then that I decided to ask her how she came to Facebook, how she balanced her personal/work life, and if there was anything she could tell me about the position. She looked as if she didn't have the time of day to spend some time to get to know me or how I worked.The whole experience was lovely over all, seeing the nice people, even through the hustle bustle of FACEBOOK. That last interviewer really caught me off guard and quite possibly could have been the reason I didn't get offered to come back for a final interview. My recruiter said that he'd keep me in the system and contact me if anything came up that I would qualify for. He stated that because I didn't have as much experience working with engineers that it could have hurt my chances.

I was as accommodating as possible, finding a quick break between meetings to speak with her about the position.

We scheduled a phone interview to follow two days later.During that time, I talked a\u2026\u00a0 bit with my mother about how relocation would affect my ability to help with a recent loss in my immediate family. I emailed the recruiter and scheduler, alerting them I didn't think I'd be able to relocate for some time, and I understood if they wanted to cancel the interview, but I'd hold the time on my calendar until hearing from them.I received a reply after the interview time, only after mentioning \"Glassdoor\". So I instead spent the interview time writing this review.Challenging work is great, being part of innovation is amazing, but as a successful professional with experience in both, I can't emphasize enough how important it is you find somewhere to work that treats people the way you'd hope to be treated in opposite shoes. This is the same way they'll treat you as innovation changes things... who knows...in a more connected/augmented reality based world what relevance a profile would even have?If I could look back I would apply this same principle to how I made friends, love interests, and how I have chosen jobs. There will always be more money to be made. There will always be smart people to work with. There will always be exciting/innovating things to be part of. But this isn't like surfing waves where you just catch another one...being part of something will change who you are/how you act/who you become.In short, don't sell your soul to hang out with this year (or decades) cool kids.",

The recruiter quickly dismissed my concerns, and proceeded to continue a technical \"quiz show\" (\"describe for me the TCP three-way handshake and what impact latency has on user experience\" for example). We finished the hour with essentially no time for me to ask any questions to qualify the position or if it was something _I_ was interested in.They immediately scheduled an interview with someone in the group I'd be working in. We started the call talking about what I'm doing now, and the interviewer asked me why I was interested in this role. I explained I didn't have the opportunity to qualify the position with the recruiter, and was looking to get that out of this call. After a couple more minutes, we acknowledged it was not a position I was interested in, and that I'd be better off in the engineering organization, which the interviewer would recommend back to the recruiter.I emailed the recruiter back with the same, and never heard from him again. Based on his title and his LinkedIn profile, I suspect he recruits specifically for this role, and wasn't going to spend any time trying to help fill another role.",

It took a while to decide if she could continue as my recruiter or if\u2026\u00a0 I needed to go through a university specific recruiter, but once my first phone interview was setup the process moved quite quickly.The first phone interview was a 45 minute coding interview. Pretty standard for the big companies. I completed 2 questions. What was the most unique about this process, is the feedback from that initial interview was shared with me by the recruiter - giving me that so I can improve on it for the in person interview, which I really think is a great reflection of Facebook's open culture.Facebook, like Google, generally doesn't hire for specific teams, however, they took the time to find a project at Facebook I would find especially interesting and fill my in person interview with people on that team so I could ask questions about it.Facebook has three types of interviews which they call Ninja, Pirate and Jedi (because they are the best kind of dorks). I had two Ninja Interviews and one Jedi. Ninja is typical coding interview where they ask 1-2 coding questions. The Jedi interview is culture fit where they ask you how you work on team, but you will also spend half the time coding. I think Pirate are focused on distributed systems type questions, but I was informed that they often skip these questions for New Grads without any explicit experience, because it's something most people learn from working in the industry and they don't get strong data from those interviews.It's also worth noting that during my job search I had coding interviews with 18 people and 17 of them were men, Facebook is the one company where I had a technical interview with a woman, although it was still the Jedi interview.I applied to Google at the same time as Facebook and their process moved a little faster, so I got an offer from Google the day before I went in for an in person interview, thankfully I had enough time to decide for Facebook to get their counter offer in, and the recruiter's care in setting me up with that team was a big part in what made me decide to go with Facebook.",

For example, if FB wanted to build a new recruiting tool, how would I go about testing my\u2026\u00a0 hypothesis and verifying my problem identification and solution.2nd Phone Interview: This one was termed \"Execution\", which I interpreted as assigning values to features and the process I would go through to vet a feature's or product's value. Turned out it was all about analytics and metrics: \"How would you decide whether to show a friend suggestion in the FB news feed every ten feed items versus an advertisement?\" \"What are the trade-offs etc?\" A lot of the interview focused on relative trade-offs and comparisons. I felt I did really badly but then got the onsite and final round invite.Onsite/Final Round: First interview focused again on Product Sense - \"how would I change the news feed?\", \"what new feature would I build?\". The second interview focused on leadership, \"tell me about a time_____\", and was designed to assess my ability to influence people and inspire. The third interview was back to Execution. I was asked to point out UI changes in the current app and use the whiteboard to graph examples of how metrics I would roll out of bed and want to look at would look.Overall, the experience was positive though the process was extremely lengthy considering there was no offer. After my final interview I was told I'd know within three days. Two weeks went by so I called and left the recruiter a voice-mail.

        "details": "This was for a position in their Infrastructure team in Cambridge MA.Recruiter contacted me in September and was very interested in my background and experience with highly scalable systems - both in Finance and Mobile phone payments.I attended some small intimate presentations they did as they were initially opening a new Boston office and wanted to grow it out. The meetings were great and I learned a lot about how\u2026\u00a0 they solve some of their biggest problems.I then did a screening interview on-site (because I don't do technical screens well on the phone). The question was \"Given a binary tree, write code to print the tree out line by line\". I did OK and got the Breadth First Search down fine, but couldn't figure out the - line-by-line part. (Turns out this is Facebook's #1 question to ask in interviews).Although my performance wasn't great they gave me a break on that and asked me back for another screening interview. This time I prepared well for another coding interview but it turned out to be a Design interview. The problem was\"Imagine you have 10,000 servers and need to monitor the performance of each one, how would you do it\" - naturally you need to be able to NOT take too much of the bandwidth and so you'll have to do sampling, have some history to watch for trends etc.I passed that and was very excited to be flown out to Menlo Park for the final round.I studied like CRAZY based on questions on this site and CareerCup. I took 4 weeks and studied about 15 hours per week.Turns out I focused on the wrong questions - I studied Tree, String, Array and List algorithms based on the distribution of Q&A but I was asked Binary math and heap algorithms. Here are the questions I was asked.1) How would you implement division without +, - or multiplication (a \"classic\" question, but not one of the ones I would focus on). I bombed on this as I was not expecting and could not recall my binary math. I figured out the high level outline but that was all. That I was asked this in the \"culture fit\" interview made this doubly unexpected.2) Given 10,000 servers containing a Billion integers each how would you find how to find the median? I knew the answer to this question (use two heaps) - not because I had focused on it, but I had found it an interesting question while studying. However he then asked \"How much memory do you need?\" and I didn't know how big the heaps would need to be. The real answer I was trying to get is - what is the minimum heap you need. I had a guess but I think I got this wrong.3) Given a List structure where each node contains a Next node and optionally a pointer to another list, flatten that liste.g.L1 --> L2 --> L3 --> L7 --> L8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0L4 --> L5-->L6WIll be flattened toL1 --> L2 --> L3 -->L4 -->L5-->L6-->L7-->L8I did OK on this - getting the answer - but it appeared I took too long. The interviewer also interrupted me a lot while I was writing an initial solution and that threw me off - I like to be more iterative in my problem solving but I think he expected 100% immediate correctness.He had an observer there too and that guy looked bored out of his mind and that bugged me a little too as it wasn't clear who would be doing the judging.4) I was also handed some hard to read Python code (I don't know Python) and asked to figure out what it does. I did OK on this - but again surprised to be handed hard-to-read code in a language I didn't know.5) One final question \"How would you implement the \"ls\" Unix function in your language of choice. It should take the input:>ls a/b/c/*/e/*/f/*/*/gand the output should be similar the the output given by unix.\"I used a tree structure to represent the file directory structure and wrote a solution from there. I did OK on this.Overall: Everyone seemed very nice - I had a nice lunch and the campus is interesting but it was clear that what I studied was not what I needed to (so lesson learned: don't just trust the distribution of questions on Glassdoor or CareerCup). I even got to walk past Zuckerberg's office (more of a conference room) and saw Sheryl Sandberg in there.One interesting thing I learned is a lot of Google people are leaving for Facebook. Also I'd say if you are over 30 (I am 41) you are a rare bird at Facebook :-)I knew based on the reactions of the interviewers that it was very probably a bust, but overall a good experience and something I will learn from. Very disappointing as I really wanted to be one of the first few Facebook engineers in the Boston area - and to work on their super high scalability issues but such is Life.",

        "details": "I was initially contacted by Facebook via a LinkedIn message. They found my resume online and thought I would be a good fit for their Site Reliability Engineer position. They asked if the position interested me, and I said that it did. They scheduled a phone interview for a week later.The phone interview consisted of some technical questions, and I had mixed results on those. I did not feel that\u2026\u00a0 I did my best, especially since I don't particularly enjoy coding in front of someone without any reference material. However, I was informed a few days later that they would like a second phone interview with me.I was surprised, and I accepted the next step in the process. Later the same day, they contacted me again to say they would rather bring me in for an onsite interview immediately instead of going through the second phone interview. I was surprised, but I accepted the offer and set up the travel dates shortly thereafter.On the morning of the interview, I underestimated the amount of time required to drive from Palo Alto to Menlo Park at 9:30am, and I arrived 5 minutes late to the interview. That was a terrible way to start the day, and I wondered if that would knock me out of the running immediately. Coming from rural NH, I was not used to heavy commuting traffic, but it was still inexcusable, and I felt defensive and angry at myself the rest of the day - not a great way to enter an interview with any company, let alone Facebook!Most of the interviews went reasonably well - programming aptitude, manager interview, etc. Two of the interviews went less well - networking knowledge and most pointedly, system architecture. The system architecture interviewer was somewhat unfriendly, but perhaps not on purpose if it was his true personality, and the interview included a \"shadow\" interviewer who didn't ask questions and only participated minimally.I had my most difficulty with this interview and did not do well with the \"what if?\" questions in general. I was disappointed with myself because I have thought of myself as someone who can design systems, but perhaps not at the scale that Facebook is looking for. At any rate, I was struggling with one question during the interview and said something like \"Well, you could do....\". I know that was a bad answer and wishy-washy, but the interviewer turned to his \"shadow\" with a wry smile and said in a sidebar \"Well, of course you could do ....\". I thought that was unprofessional and disrespectful, but tried to soldier on as best as I could. At the end of that interview, I could tell that I was not prepared well enough for it and felt that I had performed poorly on that one.I sent thank you emails to as many of the folks as I could, but when I could not find email addresses for some of them, I asked the recruiter for the rest of the addresses. Surprisingly, she replied that she \"couldn't reveal personal email addresses at the company.\" I found that to be very strange, since some Facebook employee email addresses are found easily by Googling their names. She requested that I forward my thank you emails to her for each person and she would resend them internally. Again, I found that to be a strange request, but I complied. I did not receive any confirmation of receipt from her nor from the folks that I attempted to thank, but at that point, I was convinced that it didn't matter anyway.I was told that I would hear back from them by the following Friday, but that day came and went with no contact. Finally, I received a call from the recruiter the next week, and I was told that they were no longer interested due to my difficulties with the networking and system architecture interviews.I take responsibility for arriving late to the interview and do not plan on letting that happen for any future interviews. I'll never know if that had something to do with the negative response from them, but it certainly didn't help my chances! I was disappointed with some of the employee interactions, but I guess I'll just chalk that up to having a thin skin that day and being on the defensive because I had already messed up by arriving late.",

Several days later, I spoke with the hiring manager over the phone, after which I received positive feedback and an invitation to fly to Austin for final interviews with the team.I had five on-site interviews, all lasting 30 minutes each: a two-person panel discussion, a team lead, the\u2026\u00a0 hiring manager, a team member, and the outgoing Team Lead I was replacing. The discussions ranged from scenario-based questions to how I would handle team dynamics.OUTCOME: After the discussions, I was notified several days later that I would not be receiving an offer; I requested feedback but wasn't provided any. Fortunately, a good friend of mine at FB knew the hiring manager and provided further details.SUMMARY: The process was smooth and fairly efficient, and while I got a good sense of the culture of the team, office, and company...I didn't sense a real emphasis on getting to know me better as a person. Every other discussion I've had with tech companies for these sorts of team leadership roles places a heavy amount of emphasis on my \"fit\". Example: I'm interviewing with a particular cloud-storage company (rhymes with Hot Shots :) ) for the exact same role, and during my onsite in ATX they took me out to coffee, asked me what my goals were and what I looked most forward to if I moved there.

I was impressed with the recruiter's technical knowledge, always a good sign, and agreed to go through the screening and start the interview process.The process is 5 steps:* Call with recruiter about position* Phone screening with a few trivia questions regarding systems administration.* Co-operative coding phone interview* Systems phone interview* On-Site interviewThe call with\u2026\u00a0 the recruiter was mostly about the position description and duties, and assessing whether both sides think it's a good fit. The phone screening, also done with the recruiter, is just a few questions that anyone who has administered Linux for an organization would be able to answer off the top of their head.The coding interview was done using a collaborative editing tool, so both parties could see what was being typed. The coding questions were not your typical abstract data manipulation questions, but rather questions that required systems knowledge, and in my case were most easily answered with shell scripts.I didn't actually do the systems phone interview, as they considered my programming interview strong enough to simply skip this step. I'm informed this is not uncommon.The on-site interview loop included five 45-minute segments: Programming, Systems, Networking, Solution Architecture, and meeting with the Manager (not in that order). Additionally, lunch with the initial recruiter and a brief chat afterwards with a different recruiter that dealt with the financial and logistics portions of the interview and negotiations.One thing that struck me during the entire process is that *everyone* I spoke to, and I mean *everyone* because I asked them all, absolutely loved working there. Every time I asked someone how they liked working at Facebook, their face lit up and they started listing off reasons they loved working there, and everyone had the same reason: They liked everyone around them, felt trusted and respected, and trusted and respected the people around them. This was unanimously the first reason, usually followed by \"and the work is really interesting\".",

        "details": "I initially applied in early November, 2013. I got a reply from one of the recruiters about a week later. After talking to the recruiter on the phone and emailing back and forth for a while, she realized that I was still in school (graduating mid 2014) and transferred me to another recruiter.. or rather a bunch of different recruiters who couldn't seem to figure out who I should be\u2026\u00a0 talking to. Eventually we got everything sorted out (now in January 2014) and I did two phone interviews. They both went well and shortly after, they arranged for me to fly to Seattle for a \"university day\". They put me up in a nice hotel across the street from the office and, of course, paid for meals and everything. They even set up direct deposit for the reimbursement, which was nice.The day of the interviews, I arrived in the morning and signed in and then I was met by a couple recruiters. There were also a few intern candidates but no other full time candidates. I had 3 interviews that were all fairly interesting. The first one was mostly a fit interview, the second was the in depth coding interview and the third was a combination of talking about experience and doing some coding.After the interviews, we did a tour of the office and then we met with a bunch of engineers for a Q&A session. This was a really great way to learn about the company and see how everything works there. It seemed like a really great place to work with lots of really smart engineers though I was mildly concerned about the apparent lack of organization.In the afternoon, one of the recruiters took us downtown for Seattle's \"Underground Tour\" which was really neat and later they took us out to a super fancy Italian restaurant which was excellent. Overall, it was a really great day.About a week later, I got an email from one of the recruiters asking for references and my transcript. I have an almost perfect transcript (straight A's) and I was certain that my references would say nice things about me so I felt that I had the job in the bag at this point. One of my references forwarded me the questionnaire they sent him. It was just generic questions like \"How did you know him?\", \"Would you hire him again?\", \"What were his strongest/weakest attributes?\" This reference included his answers which were all extremely positive, re-enforcing the idea in my mind that I was going to get an offer.A week or so after this, I heard from the recruiter again asking me to do more phone interviews. Supposedly, it was \"great news that [they] still [wanted] to move forward with [me]\" but I didn't really take it that way. Frankly, I find it rude and unprofessional that they would waste the time of my references if they weren't already prepared to make an offer. However, I, of course, went through with the phone interviews, uncertain what they could possibly learn about me that they hadn't already figured out in the first five interviews.The first of the second round of phone interviews (6th interview overall) went very poorly as the interviewer has a very strong accent and a horrible phone line (lots of static). I could barely understand what he was asking which made it very difficult. I contacted the recruiter about this and she seemed at least somewhat understanding. She then booked another phone interview which went quite well, as far as I could tell.Finally, the week after this (now into March), I got a rejection letter which I was rather dumbfounded by. I can't for the life of me figure out where I went wrong or why they would bother contacting references if they weren't prepared to make an offer.",

For those of you who (like me) have no idea what that means,\u2026\u00a0 it means a tiny bit of coding/scripting in a language of your choice while you work a reasonable, made-up data science scenario. They'll give you pretend access to a pretend database of information, have you write a few queries, give you fake data for your output, and have you debug plausible scenarios for that fake data.I received word rather quickly (two days later) that I passed the phone screen and would be invited to Mountain View for a day of interviews. I scheduled those interviews for 3 weeks down the line.Interviews at Mountain View are grueling, not because of their technical difficulty, but rather because of the interview setup. I was interviewed in a tiny closed cubicle no more than 8 feet x 8 feet; room for two one-seater couches and a tiny table. The wall was a whiteboard. There were 5 back to back 30 minute interviews, and while the interviewers were apparently supposed to ask if I needed water or a bathroom break, they often forgot to do so. The next interviewer was waiting right outside when the last interview ended. After we covered all of the technical content (about which I signed an NDA, so I unfortunately will not share the details of that), I had about 120 seconds to quiz my interviewer about what data science is like at Facebook.I may have earned brownie points with one on-site interviewer for stopping him when he started asking me the same question that I had had during my phone screen. He thanked me and changed to a new problem.I studied for the Data Scientist interviews by:a) coding in python (which I do for my job; they were happy to let me code in python for the on-site interviews)b) reviewing Stanford's online statistics 101 classc) doing a few 'hat trick' type probability puzzlesI was well prepared for their interview questions.I heard back from my recruiter 1 week after on-site interviews and received a generous offer with a fungible 2-week acceptance deadline.",

(LOL) Anyway, I love that he was straight forward and to the point. Marc explained there were typically 2 rounds of interviews after the phone interview. Sometimes just 1 but it all depends on the team. After the phone interview a hiring manger will contact me for a 2nd interview within a week or two and then see if I go on to the next round where I have an interview with at least two team members. I had a great experience. Even if I don't get another interview, Marc was awesome and glad I was able to connect with him.",

Also big difference from other companies: they expect you to be really fast (read - you need to know answer upfront). If you don't know answer upfront, but come up with solution after thinking, trying, making misatkes and optimizing - it doesn't count, at least it didn't in my case. Try to solve my problem below (if you don't know answer already), implement, test it on board in 15-20 minutes.Advice for FB: train your interviewers to focus on skills, NOT memorized skills.I have offer from big companies/competitors, so I will just go with them.",

I thought \"what the heck, it's a great company\" and got back to her the next day, but she was leaving for the XMas break. No more communication until early Jan. Connecting on the phone was a pain, as first she didn't call until 15\u2026\u00a0 minutes after she said she would. I had stopped standing by the phone and went to email her when she did call, so missed it. We emailed and set something up for an hour later. This time she called 30 minutes late. No apologies or anything. Sigh. She advised that I put all of my other interviews before the Facebook one so that I could get practice, and then signed me up for a free interview review course they run. I went and things were all great, so I told them I was ready. Queue another 2 week pause while they tried to answer a question I had asked before scheduling me. When I finally made it onsite for an interview (mid-late feb), I had expected it to be a full day of interviewing, but instead it was a 30 minute screen before I could do the *actual* interview. In all fairness, I should have seen that coming. But anyways, did the screen and got a response before I had even left the parking that they wanted to schedule my full interview. I also got a call from my recruiter that afternoon to give me interview feedback. I thought that was awesome, as most people don't do that. I can't say how useful it was as I had no negative feedback from my interviewers and her advice was just \"wow, keep doing whatever you just did!\" but it sounds like it could be useful if things don't go perfectly the first time around. Anywho, by this time I had multiple other offers with deadlines on them. I went ahead and scheduled the final round interview for the following week, but ended up canceling the day before as I had decided to go with another company. This seemed to irk my recruiter, despite the fact that she was the one who told me to interview with other companies first and I had been upfront about that and the associated timelines during the whole process. When initial contact and end offer are 2.5 months apart, you can't expect someone to be sitting idle that whole time...The only reason I still rank this as a positive experience is because I had a secondary recruiter I worked with coordinating onsite logistics (the girl who first contacted me was out of state) and he was awesome. If any of you get the chance, work with Charlie. He's direct and super straight forward and knows that candidates are people with multiple options and treats you as such. I do a lot of mentoring and will certainly be sending any of my mentees who expresses interest in Fbook Charlie's way; he's a real gem.",

I think my training is much more stats/machine learning oriented, so I struggled with a few questions. I signed a NDA, so I can't disclose the exact questions.

        "details": "Overall, Facebook's interview process was slow and uncoordinated.I was referred, but dealt with their internal recruiters throughout the process. After chatting with one of their recruiters, I was told they'd schedule an initial screening interview. Since I was local, this was done at their headquarters instead of over the phone. This screening was actually 3 one-on-one interviews and took over two hours. These were pretty basic questions, and none were\u2026\u00a0 too difficult.I passed the screen and went back for another round of one-on-one interviews. These questions were tougher. One was about scaling an app I'd written up to Facebook scale. Since I don't have a ton of experience working at scale, I don't know if I flubbed it or not. One was about processing log files of events to determine a user's current status. And one was about splitting strings up using a dictionary (search for \"Retiring a Great Interview Problem\" if you want the details) that I eventually worked though.After that, I was asked back to a third round of one-on-one interviews. I was told this one would be quick, but it was just as long as the others. Most of the questions were actually about work I'd done previously and data visualization.After this, I received a call from a recruiter who sounded excited, saying they were going to do a background check on me, and that I should expect to hear back when the hiring manager returned from vacation. But that time came and went, and I was eventually told (via email) that the position had been filled, so I didn't get an offer.I'd like to draw special attention to how slow this process was. After my initial contact with a recruiter, it took 2 weeks to schedule and do the screening interview. It took another 2 weeks for them to get feedback and schedule a second round. After the second round, it look another 3 weeks to get the third round scheduled. And then it was another 2 weeks before I heard back. I had nearly wide-open availability, so the only thing holding things up was Facebook.I'd also like to draw attention to how uncoordinated the recruiters were. My initial contact was with one recruiter. After chatting with him, he handed me off to a second recruiter. She scheduled the second interview, after which i was handed off to a third recruiter. And after that, the email saying the position had been filled came from a fourth recruiter. Meanwhile, the recruiters that scheduled the interviews helped escort me around on site were different than any of these. It was very, very difficult to keep track of who to contact with questions, updates, and thank yous. I also think the job title of I was applying for changed at least once during this process, which led to a little confusion in the actual interviews, though all recruiters involved assured me it was the same position.More uncoordination: they asked me to fill out an application form, and I did so and turned it in at my screening interview. They then asked from this same form at every subsequent interview, and even once over email, and I had to keep reminding them I'd already done it.Also, just a gripe. All three of my on-site interviews were scheduled to begin in the morning, and they all lasted well past noon. I was only offered lunch once.",

On the one hand, the interviewers prepared well, almost all of them coming in with a pre-prepared list\u2026\u00a0 of questions. On the other hand, some of the questions came off as if they had not looked at my resume at all. I think I handled the questions pretty well as I had done a lot of homework before I went. They had given me a list of the people I was going to talk with in advance, and I researched each one of those people and had their backgrounds, former employers, where they went to college, etc. etc. memorized going in. That research also allowed me to think ahead of time about how I wanted to \"message\" each person I was meeting with. My biggest complaint about the interview process was that I was allowed almost no time to ask detailed questions about what they were really looking for in a candidate or what the job is really like.

        "details": "While I was planning to look actively for a job in the next weeks, I have been first contacted by a Facebook recruiter (an employee, not a 3rd party company) on LinkedIn \u2013 I never really thought about Facebook at first, maybe because I imagined it was an unreachable goal. We scheduled a first phone screen: it was short, about 10 minutes, I said a bit of my background, he\u2026\u00a0 explained what Facebook is looking for an a bit of the recruiting process. After asking me 3 very easy Objective-C and iOS programming questions, he said he would like to schedule a phone interview with an Facebook engineer for me. 2 weeks later (he apologized for the long delay, I guess it's usually quicker) I had a phone interview. An engineer interviewed me, spending the first 10 minutes chatting of my background, interests and goals, then a 30 minutes peer-coding questions. As usual it was an algorithmic question, to solve in Objective-C / CoreFoundation (NSString, NSArray, NS* APIs...). She said I'll be contacted again by a recruiter in the next few days. I got a call, the recruited said I'm welcome to come on-site for a day of interviews. I gladly accepted. I then started to think I have some decent chances to get a job at this awesome company. The big day coming, I was very excited and relaxed too. I took a BART from the city and then a cab to the Menlo Park HQ. The recruited warmly welcomed me, we took some coffee, and chatted waiting for the first engineer / interviewer. The 4 interviews are as described on Facebook Careers website. First interviewer chatted a bit of my previous projects and then we had a technical question, involving iOS general knowledge, Objective-C skills, etc. Second interviewer spent most of time chatting of my previous projects, my goals, what I would like to change at Facebook if I was working here; and then we moved to a quick technical question. Then it was lunch time. I was really excited about going to visit the campus, get some good lunch and see how Facebookers are during lunch time. Many bring their MacBooks at lunch, have some fun with colleagues, and enjoy their meals. The lunch time was spent with the recruiter. After he brought me back to the interview room, the 2 next interviews were mostly algorithmic questions. Overall, I found the questions of an average level. Some iOS knowledge is required, some good sense of algorithmic, and remembering Objective-C syntax. Many says, and it's true, that unlike other companies, Facebook likes people who can code on a whiteboard with the correct syntax. It happened that I forgot a ; or wrote @implement instead of @interface. The interviewer asked me if I was sure about my syntax, I read again my code, and found my mistake. They are never (at least very rarely) misleading you. If they say \"read again\" it probably means \"there is a syntax error, find it it's a bonus\". A few days later, I got an email and then call from the recruiter who said he got very positive feedback from the interviews so he would like me to gather and send him some reference letters. So I did. A few days later, I got a call and was told I got an offer. It was a very good one.Overall, the whole process was of course stressful, but very exciting and all interviews were in a very very relaxed atmosphere. It was like chatting with new colleagues, and trying to solve together a problem.",

Most questions were problem solving (regarding HW validation) and some behavioral.I didn't really like some of the people who interviewed me. One was very rude, on his phone the entire time.\u2026\u00a0 He may have been taking notes but it is polite to state that and make the person interviewing comfortable. This person was also very arrogant and I didn't feel like he was even listening to my responses. Another guy who interviewed me kept asking me about CPU pipeline after I told him I don't know anything about the topic. I'm not sure why he was stuck on it. I told him I have a better understanding of the platform than I do CPU pipeline and drew him a block diagram of an entire system/platform.Only a couple of the folks interviewing me actually seemed like high caliber people. One was from manufacturing (works with ODM/OEM on QA) and the other was the PM (program manager). The rest seemed very junior, including the tech recruiter.I felt like I was at a college campus and I could see how egos could be running wild here, as if it were a popularity contest.",

In most cases, they\u2026\u00a0 had a little more than 1 year of experience. The problem with someone like that interviewing you is that they might not know of a good way to do it. For example, I was constantly interrupted. I let them know that I was thinking out loud and that everything I say might not be the best way to do something. When I have something concrete I'll set it forward and we can discuss that. That didn't stop the interruptions. I'd lose my train of thought and would have to start again. Again, while writing code, the same thing. I said that the code isn't optimized, i'll optimize it later. I'm trying to get it right, then tweak it later. Every few lines, I was asked if something was necessary.I was pretty frustrated by the end. I wish I could tell them that you're interviewing me- meaning you want to see how I think, check my problem solving ability and NOT show how much you know. You're probably good at what you do, else you wouldn't have been there. Can we please focus on me solving the problem?In other interviews, at other companies, I've noticed the more experience a person has the more patient and observant they are during an interview.

Would you consider a position in UK after the internship?\"One week later I\u2026\u00a0 had the first technical interview. The interview started with 5 minutes of questions about my work, then we jumped into one coding interview question. The question was simple: Write a function which given two binary numbers as strings returns the sum of them in binary. 5 minutes for my questions at the end.Few hours after the interview, I got an email from the recruiter saying that the feedback is very good and they would like to schedule the final interview.The last interview was easier than the first one: \"Given a list of strings, return a list of lists, where each list consists of words that are anagrams.\" Example: Given [\"cab\", \"cz\", \"abc\", \"bca\", \"zc\"] the output should be: [ [ \"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\"] , [ \"zc\", cz\"]]. I managed to finish this question quite fast (after only 15 min). The interviewer wanted to finish the interview after 15 minutes, but I insisted to get another question. The next question I've got was even easier: \"Write a function which returns the nth number of Fibonacci\". When I've seen the question I jumped straight away implementing it (took me like 2 minutes), then we compared the iterative method with the recursive one.After the interview, I got an email from the recruiter saying that my coding skills are very good, but the interviewer complained about the fact that I was a bit careless when answering the questions, and that I didn't explained him the Fibo solution before writing code. They wanted to schedule another interview.One week later I had the last interview, which was some kind of giving me another chance, because they usually have only 2 interviews.The last interview was much more difficult than the other two. The first question was: \"Write a recursive function which given a string, prints all the subsets of it.\" After solving this question, he added one constraint. Now what if you want only unique solutions? This was quite hard, and I only managed to solve it after he gave me one important hint.The second day I received a standard rejection email.",

Straightforward. The HR person gave me some information about the position, and plenty of information about how to prepare for the later interviews (below).2) Preliminary interview (can choose to either do on-site 1:1 or phone with online shared-document for coding).\u2026\u00a0 I went on-site. My interviewer asked a series of basic stats questions (if X1 and X2 are normally distributed (and IID) with mu, sigma, and Y=X1+X2, what is the mean and s-dev of Y?). Then basic binomial stats question - I got a little tripped up due to the nervousness, but it wasn't bad. Then he asked me to conceptually explain how I'd check if two numbers in an array sum to X. Then asked for the algorithm's time-complexity, and then asked if I could do better. Eventually he asked me to code up the faster version on the white-board. He said that he was recommending that I come for the on-site interview despite my having a bit of difficulty here and there. Nice of him to give me the benefit of the doubt. And he gave me more details about the final interview process...At this point I got passed from the screening HR person to another one, and at the same time I got another job offer so I asked to accelerate the process. They were very accommodating, which was really nice. Final interview was scheduled for 3 business days later and I was told I'd know if I was going to receive an offer the same day as my final interview! About as quick a turn-around as I can imagine them doing. Very helpful.3) Final on-site interview consists of 5 quick meetings (30min each) with different analytics team members and one Product Manager. Was coding on the white-board in 3/5 of the interviews. First one was dynamic/recursive programming focused (Python). Second one was database insight focused (SQL) that began with a description of a SQL table and a new feature and then asking what metrics you'd look at to diagnose the health of the feature/product. Then write those queries. He told me what numbers I would have seen from those queries, and then asked me what that would imply to me, and then he had me do another few queries to diagnose what might be giving the skewed numbers he'd given me. Third one started with a straight-forward Bayesian stats question (I realized it was most amenable to the Bayesian approach after flailing with frequentist stuff for a minute), then we moved to a few questions about Recommendation systems and any intuition I had around those. Fourth one started with an explanation of a \"new feature\" and a graph of adoption rates, then asked me to explain to a non-technical person what the graph meant/implied. Asked for any ideas I had around why the graph might be shaped the way it was. Last one was with a Product Manager who asked what products I was interested in - a few probing questions to make sure I'd done some homework on those products. Then some A/B testing questions where he explained another change they'd made to one of their products and asked me how I'd decide if that was a good change or not. Then some questions about how I'd diagnose why something wasn't working as expected.I felt like I did well - but I didn't nail the questions right away. I got the answers, but I'd bet that I flailed a bit too much on-route for the interviewers' tastes. Sort of a shame since I see a little bit of flailing around as an important part of the creative problem-solving process, but I could understand how it wouldn't inspire confidence in someone who already knows the answer and is just waiting for you to get there. And maybe they just want people who know all the answers already or never get challenged by anything.In any case, the whole experience was very professionally handled. I was very impressed by the transparency of their process. I had seen the Glassdoor interview feedback from a few unhappy previous interviewees and it was clear that (at least in my case) the HR team had seen the same complaints and had corrected things as much as they could.

She asked about a few specific projects in my portfolio, and asked follow up questions on how I would adjust the design based on different hypothetical criteria.Was contacted around a week later from my requiter notifying me that I would not be moving forward with the process. I asked for a follow up conversation to get feedback, which was granted. During that conversation, I was told my main reason for being passed on was that I did not have enough experience.

        "details": "This was for the data scientist/business analytics role.a little background on me: I just received my bachelors. I do not know if what I say will necessarily be applicable to people in a different situation.Starting from the beginning: I applied cold with my resume through their website. Then there was an optional coding question. Pro tip: Do it.The question was a bit more difficult than your average weed out question.\u2026\u00a0 The question was a game theory - esque question, e.g. \"given these rules of a game and a starting point, tell me whether player 1 or player 2 will win\". They gave me 2 hours for the question. I spent about 45 minutes thinking/writing code (final solution was about 25 lines of python code, the idea was the tricky part), then 15 minutes commenting code and trying to make it look pretty. Another pro tip: The question is timed. try to finish as fast as possible while still giving a solid solution/explanatory comments.Within a few days (maybe one or two) I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter to set up a a phone or 1:1 onsite interview, I opted for the phone interview. The recruiters are awesome/responsive. If they're not responding they're likely in meetings, don't fret. You will be talking with the recruiters quite a bit. They set up phone calls with you (not interviews) just to get a sense of who you are throughout the process. Be friendly and convey your excitement.The phone interview: It was not crazy difficult for me. There's obviously no hard tips I can give you aside from 1) try not to let the phone go silent, always be telling them what you're thinking about, even while writing code. Justify it line by line, this way if you mess up along the way they can point it out before you dig the hole too deep. Then again, don't expect them to point out every error you make. 2) Expect a mathematical question. It won't be some stupid straight coding question like \"reverse the words in this string\".This interview was a while ago, but i'll try to recall the general structure of it. They ask you some sql like query questions. I didn't know sql, so I answered in python. They asked me to code the question in a shared doc, then after I got the right solution they asked me to answer (verbally) a mathematical elaboration of that question. This elaboration lead into a discussion, and then questions from my end.Soon after I was asked to come in for an onsite interview. It was a greet with my recruiter, then 5 interviews with no break for lunch (which I would recommend). The interviews were a lot of fun. It was 2-3 data science type of people, a product manager, and a staff data scientist.I signed an NDA so I can't tell you what they asked me but the recruiter will tell you the general type of questions they ask. Some questions involved writing code, some didn't. All of them felt like a discussion. (e.g. I offer an important component about answering the question, and they say \"but what about this case where your component doesn't help?\" and you iterate.)They work heavily with sql, but they don't count it against you if you don't know it. Use whatever language you feel most comfortable in.Tips:Don't be nervous. Smile, I can't say this enough. If you act like you're being shot at it will make the process painful. I even made a few jokes and so did my interviewers. Don't be afraid to laugh, this isn't an interrogation. If you're excited about the job, they'll be able to tell. Don't beat around the bush/avoid questions. I had 10 minutes left in an interview and my interviewer asked if I wanted to stop and ask him questions, I said \"no, I like your questions, let's keep going\". That kind of excitement will shine through and make the interview feel natural. Just keep calm and keep it conversational. Ask for clarification on a question if you're even slightly unclear about the problem. Try to keep talking/express what you're thinking during the entire process. Also, be creative, they're looking for that.Most importantly, try to honestly convey your passion/excitement for the job. These guys love their job and want to see that you will too. That being said, don't fake it. Your interviewers are ridiculously smart so you won't be able to fool them.Good luck!",

This might have happened because my technical knowledge and experience seemed to be over his head, and he was probably just reading from a script. e.g. \"Tell me about yourself and why you applied\" .... then right into the next question, \"Have you ever led a team\" .... next question \"Tell me a time when you solved a problem\". It was rather frustrating because my resume clearly stated that I had managed multiple teams (up to 100 people) over the years.Afterwards, he said he was excited to pass my resume on to the actual team I'd be working with and then get back to me about the next step. When I didn't hear in a week, I followed up, and then followed up after three weeks - no response, ever. It's safe to say they weren't interested, but given that it took them almost two months to call me up after I submitted my referred resume, and never got back to me afterwards, I'd say it's best to just pass these guys up. They are moving too fast for their own good.",

I did apply to a few different roles on their site so I wasn't sure what was up.Turns out first phone call was with hiring manager and I was getting interviewed for a software engineer position. Hiring manager asked if I was told what positions were available and I said no and he was glad to explain for me. I told the manager I was hoping for a security engineering job, not software engineering. He told me I might be a better fit for a different team and he will tell the other manager I was interested and I will hear from him. I asked if there was a opening on that team and he said they are always hiring new talent. I took that as a good sign. I didn't actually get asked to code during the phone interview. I followed up with the recruiters asking where to proceed and whether I could interview with the manager on the other team and they said they will get back to me.I waited and got no emails setting up another interview. I asked what's going on and have not heard back. It's been 10 days. I guess I have been dropped?I am disappointed at the lack of communication and lack of detail from the recruiters.

I loved the campus and the interaction with the engineer. He almost answered all my questions and further gave me reasons about why working at Facebook was awesome. Post lunch, had 3 back to back technical interviews. All the interviewers were smart, provided enough information about the problem and also left grey areas for me to ask and figure out. For all the questions, implementation was expected. Most of the time during my interviews, I was standing and writing/discussing code on the white board.

I could have been a bumbling idiot at other companies and they would never know.The Product Manager to\u2026\u00a0 Developer ratio is insane. For the group that I talked to there were 5-6 product managers for 200 developers. This 1:40 ratio basically means that product managers are rare unicorns and you won't get a job offer. In fact, look through the product manager interview feedback here and you won't see a single \"offer declined\" posting.You will be asked a bunch of quant questions instead. In one interview that I had, the interviewer didn't introduce himself at all and we did 4 case questions in a row over 45 minutes including \"How would you determine how to rank posts in the news feed\", \"How would you determine the negative value of an abusive posting\", \"How would you calculate the number of daily registrations that Facebook has\". They're good questions but wow it's a ton of work.By far the worst interview questions that I've ever gotten came up with 2 different interviewers here. I'm actually sorry that I didn't do more research online before the interview because these questions are the most easily prepared for. I could have memorized the answers ahead of time. Question was \"Pick an industry that will be different in 10 years and how can Facebook be a part of that\". It's pretty difficult to be that creative on the spot. I wish I gave the question an hour of thought before coming to the interview.I was disappointed with the quality of people that I interviewed with considering that Facebook is one of the more recognized names in the business.

It ended like \"I gotta go\" \"Ok\" \"Click.\"That ended with a rescheduled phone interview because I wasn't assessed any of my skills. The second phone interview went well, but because I didn't use SQL and insisted on using python they decided i \"am a better fit for BI.\"Well this is the part of the process that angered me enough to write this review.

I was asked to turn it in within the week.I submitted my answer and within 2 hrs the recruiter wanted to setup a screening call. I setup the call 2-3 days later.\u2026\u00a0 The call went fine, no curve balls, mostly about my background and how I'd used metrics/analytics in the past to make product decisions.He then wanted to setup a call with a team member. I spoke to a manager in the product specialist group about a week later. Again no surprises. Mostly questions about background and how I'd previously done customer development - user-interviews, metrics etc. She had a few questions on how I would decide (using data, feedback etc) to implement a new feature on Facebook.A couple of days later I was contacted by a HR member to schedule an onsite visit with the team. I was told I would meet up to 6 team-members and talk to them for 30 min each. I scheduled the meeting a week later.On the day of the interview I met 4 people not 6. They were all managers in different functions within the product specialist team. Most questions were on my background and some analytical questions. Also standard product management questions - e.g. how I would decide between two features, which one to implement. Most of these questions were Facebook centric, i.e. they picked specific Facebook features as examples.I also spent some time brushing up on my SQL as I figured they would quiz me on that but they didn't. I thought the interviews went pretty well. Nothing I couldn't really answer.I received an email 4 days later saying I didn't receive the offer. Overall the process was very smooth and the HR team was responsive and helpful. The rejection email was a standard one which said I didn't have the right \"background\". I don't believe that, as my background was more relevant to the job than some of the guys who interviewed me. I suspect some of it had to do with a lack of \"cultural fit\" as everyone who interviewed me was about younger than me.",

This engineer's confessed style was improvisational, probing areas of\u2026\u00a0 knowledge my previous answers had laid claim to. It helped to know enough systems stuff, and to be interested enough in it, to make the conversation span the whole interview time.I passed the third phone interview, so Facebook flew me to their campus for a day of on-site interviews. I had to sign an NDA covering my experiences on that day. What I can say is that I thought it went at least as well as my phone interviews, yet I got a rejection email a week later.",

He put me in their system and around 4 days later, a recruiter called for first contact.The recruiter was quick to assess what I have done and decide to bring me straight in for a 1h30 min interview the next week. In this session I got a quick \"hi\" from the\u2026\u00a0 recruiter and then two 30 min slots, one on architecture and design (so called pirate interview) and the other on coding (ninja). Of the 2, I stormed the coding question but met with an interviewer in the pirate side that had tailored a question from his previous experience in the area I had recently worked in and it didn't work out (mostly as I knew more about the topic and the interviewer wanted to talk about a specific trick he knew). Still, I got called back the next week for a full day.Lunch, more coding, culture interviews etc... Coding and design were knockouts again, the softer skills were less successful. I think the key here is that you need to present a confident, well rehearsed personality with answers for the usual questions (biggest mistake etc...). DO NOT talk about mistakes and then admit you don't know the root cause for them, even if they were true mysteries. Pick another example!!!The process took ~4 weeks, the end dragging out by 2 weeks as it seems they could not decide if it was a hire or not. I had multiple offers by this time and had to take one that was expiring and too good to miss. Later I found that there was no hire decision and felt ok about it - I would probably think about going back at some point, but with a stronger prep in the softer skill Q+A side.",

Once we had a phone conversation she said they can move really fast: ~1 week to make an offer.I went on site for a first round interview (since I'm local to the area). The interviewer was nice. She asked me to describe\u2026\u00a0 what I work on now. Then we jumped into two coding problems. I interpreted the problem as a Hamming Distance problem and asked if it was, she kind of shrugged it off -- I don't think she knew what Hamming Distance meant. I coded a solution on a laptop (new trial process they were doing), but it turned out we were not talking about the same problem. In retrospect, the problem she was describing was Levenshtein Distance. I had the feeling she only knew the solution to the problem because she had the answer sheet.The second problem was another classic DP problem. Finding the sum of 1's in a submatrix. I went on to describe the recurring relation for the subproblem in the linear case. She didn't want me to do that and she quickly said the solution to the 2D case was a generalization of the 1D case.Because of the novelty of the laptop in the interview and the misunderstanding of the initial problem, the recruiter fought for me to do another phone screen even though the first one didn't go that well.The second interview I opted for a phone interview. This time the interviewer seemed more knowledgable and came into FB through an acquisition. I was asked what I work on now and some hard problem I solved in the past. Again two interview questions were asked (using collabedit). The first was to list out all the paths in a binary tree which was simple. I did make some mistakes and corrected it in the code as we talked through use cases. The second problem was checking if a string was a palindrome for strings with symbols and spaces in them which again is easy. I did solve both problems, but in the beginning the interviewer stated he's looking for accuracy and performance. My tree traversal was a simple preorder traversal using recursion and the palindrome involved one loop.Apparently the second interview did not go well even though I provided correct solutions in both. I guess the interviewer was serious when he said he's looking for correctness -- I guess you need to be able to code compilable/error-free code in a text editor.The recruiter and onsite coordinator were very helpful and the interviewers were very friendly. However, the style of FB interviews seems to be that you should study and know by heart common interview puzzles/algorithms/DP problems and be able to reproduce that error free.",

The recruiter called me a couple of hours before to tell me the first interview was to focus on \"vision\" and the second to focus on \"analytics\".The product managers I spoke to were both polite and quite efficient. After some pleasantries we got into the first real question which was \"Choose a technology you are particularly excited about and why\". Then the interviewer asked me to talk about the disadvantages of the new technology and it's potential negative effects. The third question was about how this new technology could be integrated into a Facebook product. This part was tricky because I had chose a technology that would be difficult to integrate into Facebook products given their challenges with privacy issues. I felt the interview when well and I was confident in my answers but I would like to have chosen a technology that was a more natural fit with Facebook's current products.The second phone interview took place right after the first and focused on analytics. \"You are the PM of the Facebook timeline - how would you measure retention?\". My background is with small startups and I could tell right away that the interviewer didn't like my answers as he kept asking the same question in a different way.

The questions got progressively more difficult.The first was: Given two string representations of binary numbers (e.g. \"1001\", \"10\") write a function that adds them and returns the result as a string as well (e.g. \"1011\").The next had several parts:(a) first, write a function to calculate the hamming distance between two binary numbers(b) write a function that takes a list of binary numbers and returns the sum of the hamming distances for each pair(c) the answer I gave for b was O(n^2), I was then tasked with finding a more efficient solution. I struggled mightily, and was eventually helped to the solution by many hints from the interviewer.After that, I had a chance to ask questions of the interviewer, and then we were done.

It was not a difficult interview process, but I got the sense they were looking for a particular fit -- someone who was passionate about data, marketing, and could communicate big ideas to grow Facebook.

        "details": "I applied online sometime in December. Basically you can just submit your Facebook profile and a resume.A recruiter contacted me through LinkedIn in mid-December and seemed unaware that I had applied for the job but wanted to talk to me. I told her my availability and did not hear back from her.I missed a call from the recruiter the first week of January. Apparently she had sent me a message\u2026\u00a0 that I never received scheduling our interview for that time and date. I then had a lot of difficulty getting a message back to her and thought it must have had to do with some problem with the LinkedIn messaging system. Eventually I had an interview with the recruiter that was a pretty basic HR screening interview.After that I had a phone interview with a UX Researcher. Actually, we had the same mysterious difficulty in which she had supposedly sent me a message scheduling the interview that I did not receive, and I missed the first call from the UX Researcher. (I really looked into every possibility and don't see how it could have been any problem on my end, which was really frustrating). We cleared it up and had it the next week. The interviewer was driving a car during the interview...After that I had another phone interview with a different UX Researcher who was a little tougher.I was then scheduled for an on-site visit at the beginning of March. A recruiter called me the day before my trip and mentioned that I would be doing a mock user test before the three interviews I had already been informed of.At the beginning of the visit, I had 15 minutes to prepare for the mock user test, and then was led to a room to conduct the test while a room full of UX Researchers observed through a mirrored window. I was kind of anxious to get through it and get to the interviews I had spent most of my time preparing for, but I thought it went fine enough. Afterwards we had a short discussion about the test, then I had lunch with the recruiter.After lunch the recruiter left me alone for a few minutes, then came back to inform me that we weren't going to continue the interview because I had missed a lot of opportunities in the user test.Hmm... OK.Overall it wasn't a terrible experience, but I really feel that *they* may be missing a lot of opportunities in the way they are recruiting.The emphasis on moderating tests wasn't clear at any point of the process and was not even emphasized when the on-site visit was scheduled. If it had been, I certainly would have been more prepared for that particular aspect of the visit. Regardless, I don't see how those 15 minutes could have indicated to them that I would not be able to moderate tests in whatever the ideal Facebook approach to moderating tests is. I kind of suspect that there is something else they are looking at - or maybe they just didn't like the look of me.",

        "details": "Facebook recruiters come to my university each year to recruit talent. In November, a recruiter reached out to me to see if I would be interested in an opportunity at Facebook during the summer. I hadn't been looking for internships at the time, nor did I apply to Facebook, so I was pretty surprised by the message. After I told them I would be interested, I had a phone screening\u2026\u00a0 with a recruiter, during which they asked me pretty basic technical questions (a question about Java key words, can't remember the rest). I did well enough to pass this stage and then I was given the option to go for a phone interview, or an on campus interview. My recruiter told me that candidates usually do better during on campus interviews, so I was scheduled for one a month later. My on campus interview went really well, and the interviewer was really nice and easy to talk to. I got a message from my recruiter that night that I would have the opportunity to fly out to their main office for a final round interview. I attended their \"Intern Day\", which was a day filled with one 45-minute interview, an informational session about the internship program, a tour of the office, talks given by current Facebook engineers, and also lunch in their cafeteria. My interview could have been better- I got the answer, but I stumbled a bit along the way. I recognized my errors pretty quickly and was able to correct myself throughout the process, so I think this was a plus. I was contacted the week after my interview about different internship positions available at Facebook. After considering the options, I was given an offer for the SDE intern position about a week after that. The entire process spanned 5 months, but it was totally worth it!",

        "details": "I submitted my resume online and was able to indicate a Facebook employee (a former colleague of mine) to act as a reference.A week later, I was contacted by a recruiter letting me know that based on my profile I looked like I would be a good fit, and included a writing test for me to complete in one week, which was a sufficient amount of time. The writing test\u2026\u00a0 included two parts: first, write one page guide for users on how to use FB Events, specifically for the teacher demographic.About one week later, the same recruiter wrote me saying I had passed the writing test and that she would like to chat on the phone. The phone interview with the recruiter was pretty straight-forward. She just asked me about my background, what type of work I did at each job, why I left each, and why I'd like to work for Facebook. She also asked me if I had used data to make decisions, inform my writing, and also whether I had done a/b testing. Towards the end she asked me housekeeping questions, was I considering other jobs, when could I start, what my salary expectations were, and after that she said everything checked out and she felt comfortable inviting me to meet with the content team for an on-site interview, plus another writing test. Her advice to me: study Facebook Help Center, Facebook in the press, think analytically about how to improve Help Center, user education considering mobile and international audiences.A few days later, the details of my on-site interview were e-mailed to me by an HR assistant, laid out nicely and clearly. I had about 1.5 weeks to prepare for the on-site and took the recruiter's advice.On-site interview was on a Wednesday from 9 to 11:30 AM.First 30 minutes were dedicated to the writing test given. They provided me with a Macbook in a small conference room. The writing prompt asked me to re-write two FAQs from the Help Center. I was interrupted twice during my writing test, once by the HR assistant who came in to connect the ethernet cable, and a second time by the original recruiter who introduced herself and mentioned that the first writing test would have more weight than this one, this one was more to test how I write under pressure. I still don't know if those interruptions were intentional, either way, I lost about 5 minutes and this led to me not being able to complete the writing test (had about 25% left).Next two hours, I met with 5 people on the content team; three were 1:1 including with the hiring manager, and I met with the two more junior team members as a pair. They all came into the conference room with their MacBook Pros ready to type notes as they interviewed me. All their questions were about the same: describe myself, what was my work like at X, Y, Z. How would I improve the Help Center, How have I used data to inform writing, What do I think is the point of the Help Center, etc. etc. The hiring manager asked questions with a little more purpose. She asked me what other writing jobs I was looking at, when I described them to her she said they sounded a lot more \"creative\" than the work I'd be doing at Facebook and was that OK with me? I was caught off guard by that, but kept my ground and kept it positive. She also asked me if I had experience doing pivot tables. I said yes but my voice wavered as I do not have a lot of experience with it. She emphasized a couple more times in the conversation that there was no room for creativity or color in Help Center content, and that that was more for the Marketing team. I think after talking to me she sensed that the type of work I am better fit for is more editorial and creative, and the actual work at Facebook would not be fulfilling to me as someone 5 years into my writing/marketing career with a strong sense of what I want to do and feel most passionately about.One week later, I got an e-mail from Facebook recruiting thanking me, saying I was not a fit based on my background, etc. Pretty standard. I think the interviews went well for me, but in the end, I was not a fit.",

The recruiter was very helpful but towards the end she sounded like a robot repeating her thank you phrase... Also reminded me of flight attendents that rush through their sentences with the most monotone voice ever. She told me right off the bat that she wanted\u2026\u00a0 me to speak with the hiring managers after our interview. She didn't want to give any names out of the hiring managers. They're very secretive about that but she let me in on his first name, which I actually found on LinkedIn. She emailed me the details for my next phone interview which was the next day. She gave me a bunch of links to be familiar with and to help me study. I spent all my time studying and focusing on the FB ad products, none of which made it to the next round interview chat.2. Phone interview with hiring manager- went awfully (in my opinion) as I blanked on the first question he asked me. (Math question.. see below) I know I could do it but put on the spot on the phone was just too uncomfortable for me and my nerves got the best of me. He sounded so pretentious but started to warm up a bit. He even held my hand through out the math problem that i epic-ly failed. After the first question I bombed, I really wanted to hang up or tell him he didn't have to waste his time anymore on me haha. Anyway I tried my best to revive myself from his unexpected questions. It was definitely nothing the recruiter prepped me for, but then again she was just trying to help. Anyway after 20 minutes he said \"Oh wow it's already been 20 minutes? I have a meeting in 10 minutes. Do you have any questions for me?\" He didn't even allow me to talk about myself or give me the stand to give my background.. i guess that's what the 1st interview was for.. but i just felt i had a lot more to offer based on my experience and i was really bummed that he didn't give me a chance to do that. What's worse, our convo was cut short so I couldn't ask him all the challenging questions I wanted to. I even asked if I could give a suggestion for FB improvements but he said, \"that's a great idea and thanks for suggesting that but to be completely transparent so many people have suggested that to me but i do appreciate you taking the time to think of that.\" What a great way to end the interview! :D There you have it-- FB people will be totally transparent with you on whether or not they want to follow up.

Then I met with the interviewers, two PMM's who made me feel comfortable from the beginning. I had two half hour interviews focused on:- Their hiring needs: organizational needs, positions they were hiring for and what those positions entailed.- My professional experience: they asked a couple of questions about what I do and about some of the steps I took in my career.- Case study / brainstorming product improvements. We focused specifically Facebook Login and App Install Ads. This was the most challenging part and the most interesting as well.

I didn't finish the problem (it was a hard one to get my head around), but I think I was on the right track. I didn't hear back for a couple weeks or so after first applying, so I assumed my answer was deemed insufficient.Much to my surprise,\u2026\u00a0 I received an email from one of the recruiters, wanting to set up an initial screening interview. After the phone screen with the recruiter, I also had an interview with one of the members of the team I was applying to, which primarily consisted of doing two programming problems. Both problems were pretty simple and I must have done well, as they asked me to come out for an on-site interview. Thus I crammed myself into a seat on the airplane and flew out for the interview.All in all I had three \"formal\" interviews during the day, plus a more informal lunch and tour. The first interview pretty much was to gauge my ability as a programmer, to see if I knew what I was talking about. I believe I did pretty good here, although I completely blanked when trying to answer a question regarding RESTful services. It's something I could have figured out pretty quickly looking at code, but not something I was going to answer very well there, as I am somewhat ignorant when it comes to some of the terminology.The second interview was more of a test of my problem solving skills. I think I did pretty well here as well, although it a bit difficult, as I was expecting a bit more guidance and feedback from the interviewer as I was going through the problem.The third interview was with the team's supervisor, and I believe this was to get a feel for what kind of employee I would be, and if I would be a good fit for the team. I think I rambled on for far too long about my job history, and the interviewer was unable to get to everything they wanted to in the short amount of time we had.The lunch was delicious and the tour was interesting. I enjoyed the chat during the lunch and tour with the employee who accompanied me, and I think I came off pretty well.After lunch, I had to give a presentation to what the rest of the team that I would hopefully be joining. I believe I did a decent job with the presentation, considering limitations I had encountered due to some technical issues I had. The group in the presentation had a couple questions, then left. I was then quickly shuttled out of the building by one of the recruiters. I got the feeling that the interviews hadn't gone as well as I had thought they were going, and that I would not be joining the team.

They want\u2026\u00a0 to see that you can think quantitatively and have a clear thought process.- Vision. Imagine an industry 10 years out (transportation, local commerce, fashion, etc.) and describe it. This was the interview I most enjoyed, as it's really about brainstorming and thinking BIG. The key is to identify trends and have a framework for evaluating what could be.- Design. Typical PM stuff -- design a new feature or product. What's the framework for identifying needs and segments. Identify solutions and priorities. Draw rough wireframes.- Cultural Fit. Are you a good person? Will you fit with other FBers? They ask you typical interview questions here like: why do you want to work at FB, what would you most want to work on, etc.Overall the PMs are exceptionally nice and really tried to make our meetings more like conversations rather than interviews. Honestly I wasn't sure about joining FB before I interviewed but was convinced during the course of the interviews by the really smart and nice guys I met during the process.The process was relatively quick -- from the time of first contact to the offer was about a month.

During initial phone screen, the possibility of applying instead for the Technology Partner role was presented (based on my diverse background as a founder/PM and application developer).

I was asked a\u2026\u00a0 broad range of questions, from the expected (\"Why Facebook?\") to the very specific (questions about using data to inform product decisions at my prior companies). There were a handful of process questions--fairly standard product management type stuff.After the initial phone interview, I was contacted by the recruiter to setup a phone interview with the hiring manager's boss. This interview was similar in format to the prior phone interview, and the same types of questions were asked. I could sense that they were looking for specific data points on prior product decisions, so having a handful of \"for instance\" answers proved very helpful. At the end of this call, I was told that the recruiter would be arranging my travel details for an on-site interview.The onsite interview process was fairly straightforward. Facebook is awesome about scheduling travel for out of town applicants, and the arrangements were made without a hitch. The on-site interview consisted of six 45min. interviews as well as lunch with the recruiter.While I can't provide specific questions, make sure you brush up on your SQL! For this position, there was one basic engineering interview (which I found to be very enjoyable, having to do with the style of the particular engineering manager, and the types of questions asked). In addition to the engineer, I interviewed with two Technology Partners, the hiring manager, the hiring manager's boss, and an analyst.I was very comfortable with the questions asked, other than a brief stumble on a SQL question. I enjoyed the personalities of everyone I interviewed with, and everyone was punctual and very reassuring.I emailed the recruiter a week after the onsite interview, and was promptly phoned.

        "details": "I was contacted by a Facebook Recruiter to discuss this position. I have over 12 years of experience while the position expected someone with just 4+ years of experience. This made me wonder if it was too junior a position for me. But the recruiter explained that at Facebook most employees with 4+ years of experience are expected to be able to do this job. It's not that the position\u2026\u00a0 is of a junior level; it's just the caliber of people expected at Facebook. This, both, impressed and intimidated me.After the initial chat with the recruiter, I had a 45-minute interview with the Hiring Manager. Although he was poker-faced throughout the interview, he was warm and never made me feel uncomfortable. He went to great lengths to explain the role, it's position within the company and the culture of FB. I came away wanting to work there even more!When I didn't hear back from the recruiter for about 2 days after the interview (I'm impatient!), I emailed her requesting a feedback. She immediately called me back and said that they were working on trying to bring me back for more detailed interviews with the team. And within a couple of days they scheduled another on-site for me. This time I was to be interviewed by the Hiring Manager again, his boss and 3 of his direct reports who would be peers of the position that I was interviewing for. The interview would last for almost 4 hrs of 45minutes with each interviewer.I was surprised to be interviewed by the Hiring Manager again but I soon realized that my initial chat with him had been just that - an informal chat. This time around he grilled me in detail about the various projects I had managed in the past. He made me draw a process flow of the Business area that I would be supporting and asked detailed questions of every aspect; he didn't miss a thing. The same pattern followed with the other interviewers too. They came prepared with specific questions about my work experience and as I answered them I realized that they were able to extract from me all the information they needed to learn about my working history and experience in a very precise manner.Looking back at the interview, those 4hrs at Facebook were quite grueling and taxing for my mind because I hadn't had such an intense interview in years. I had never had to draw process flows or explain SQL statements or present a graphic outline of the various systems within my business area before. However, I now realize that they probably have a very good idea of what I know and especially, what I don't know. Throughout the interviews all of them said the same thing to me - do not worry; there is no right answer; it's okay if you don't know.As for me, I learnt a lot about the culture at Facebook and what this position would require of me if they offered me the position. I learnt that they expect things to move along at a fairly quick pace without any bureaucratic culture. They don't expect you to succeed in every venture you take up and would never punish you for occasional failures that are bound to happen. They just want enthusiastic, intelligent and passionate people to work with.Each and every interviewer at Facebook came across as super-smart and passionate about their jobs. 3 out of the 5 told me that they cannot imagine working anywhere else now. I came away knowing that not only will this be a challenging place to work but it will also be an opportunity to work with some really smart people who completely enjoy what they are doing.I haven't received any feedback from FB yet but no matter which way this goes, I feel super happy about having had the opportunity to interview there and get a glimpse of its working.",

They always replied promptly and helpfully, and were awesome to work around my schedule every step along the way.In the final analysis I just wasn't a good fit for the position - and I even agree with them. After seeing and hearing so much of the cool stuff they do behind the scenes and are working on doing, I am not (yet) qualified for that job. In the end, the thing I felt most qualified in was my big stumble. What I learned was to be on their level, it wasn't enough to have just done what I've done for a long time - that they justifiably want an expert in multiple disciplines.Their benefits are just absurdly great. Everything they offer is top-notch including their facility in Menlo Park, where the old Sun research campus used to be.In the end, it was a great experience.

        "details": "My Facebook interview process might be described in a single word... lengthy :) The process could drag on at times, but to be fair, this all happened around the time of the IPO and the campus move to Menlo Park, so in a very real sense it's a wonder it moved along at all. My (generally very positive) experience went like this:1. Recruiter phone screen with questions about my background\u2026\u00a0 and a few simple technical questions.2. 8-hour programming test to be completed within one week.3. 2 or 3 (I forget exactly) 1-hour online coding tests, where the interviewer watches you code remotely in real time.4. 4 more technical interviews at the Menlo Park Facebook HQ.Everyone was very polite and helpful throughout the process. By the end I felt like I had forged a new friendship with my recruiting team, who were all great about keeping me informed, especially towards the end of the process. Travel to Facebook HQ for the onsite was well-managed - I stayed at a nearby hotel and all local travel was reimbursed. The onsite lunch was very good :)The four onsite interviews all had the same format: maybe 10-15 minutes on interviewer/interviewee backgrounds, 20-25 minutes for a technical interview (all involved coding with a marker on a whiteboard), and some time reserved at the end for general questions the interviewee might have about FB. All interviewers were technically very sharp, as one might expect, though I experienced absolutely none of the of supposed Facebook arrogance that some reviewers have reported. They're very good and expect you to be very good, which is fair, but nobody was rude.I won't reveal any particular questions, but I'll say that none were terribly \"computer sciency\" in nature. You'll obviously want to be able to write hand-coded Javascript/HTML/CSS with some facility, to understand how different browsers load & interpret your code and render pages, to explain how the web works in general, etc. You should be prepared to discuss various tradeoffs between different approaches to solving UI Engineering problems. You should be able to defend the code you write, predict how it will behave, and make amendments if the requirements change a bit.The 8 hour programming test was by far the most difficult coding question. I don't know if my submission was perfect but I sure wrote a hell of a lot of tests and tried to break it every way I could think of before sending it in.There were no \"gotcha\" questions, which I've seen on almost every other interview I've been on in my career (e.g., add the numbers 1-100 in your head; name as many table-related HTML elements as you can, what are all the HTTP verbs, etc). Questions were mostly of the \"implement this\" format, with a somewhat broad description of some interaction model.It's worth noting that I was explicitly invited to provide feedback on Glassdoor, which I feel reflects positively on the FB culture.",

Went through an initial phone screening with both some general and canned technical questions.After that heard nothing so I assumed I didn't meet initial criteria.Beginning of September or so I received an email from a recruiter with renewed interest. Again went through an initial \"pre-screen\" phone interview. Followed up by 2 more technical phone interviews.Finally\u2026\u00a0 received an invitation to an on-site round of interviews. Was flown to San Francisco for a 5 hour interview. FB covered all costs. It was definitely challenging!! Which is good when you've been in a senior level position for a number of years.Was first introduced to a \"recruiting coordinator\", followed by \"technical program manager\" (project mgr). After that came a VERY challenging individual who (being an ex Cisco product engineer) asked some very in-depth technical/theory/text book questions, and did his best to mix you up by questioning answers and presenting potentially wrong answers to make sure you knew your stuff. Have to admit it worked and know I had a couple of epic fails!Lunch with the technical recruiter and a tour around the campus. Bit of a \"get a feel for you\" session. Following lunch was another 2 technical interviews. Both again very challenging. A lot of \"how would you design a new campus network\" and \"how would you troubleshoot this\" questions. Etc...Finally was the interview with the hiring manager. Great guy. Questions about thoughts on change control, itil, working in an environment where there is a limited subset of the former, etc... Some other general \"how would you deal with\" personality questions.All in all very thorough. Having spent many hours on the other side of that table looking for the right candidate, a job well done. They'll no doubt find exactly what they're looking for... unfortunately I wasn't it (still not sure why, but the other guy was \"a bit better of a fit\" in their words)...

I then met with the group manager, who was very nice, not technical at all, but asked me situation type questions about conflict management.

The recruiter was extremely knowledgeable and conducted a rather in-depth screening interview himself that lasted 20-30 minutes. At the end of the interview he was very forward that I passed his smoke test and needed to\u2026\u00a0 get in for some on-site interviews. He was very communicative over the course of the next few days (first call was on Tuesday) and set up 2 interviews by the end of that week. He called the day before the interviews to prep me.The first two on-site interviews with PMs were much more congenial and collaborative than other BigCo PM interviews I've had. I was impressed. The personality they're looking for shines through and it's obvious that they give a good amount of autonomy and power to their PMs. The internal recruiter took 10-15 minutes to give me a tour, chat about anything, and was very informative and warm.The PM recruiting team communicated often to let me know where they were in the process, and I had a go-ahead for 2nd round interviews within a week. Again I was prepped a day before interviews. I had 4 interviews scheduled for my 2nd round, each about 45 minutes long. Questions ranged from product/feature design to mapping the flow of interactions between people and discussing needs/motivation to general industry knowledge and strategy. None of the interviewers were hostile or cold.Although I was not given an offer, I was again surprised and quite happy that the recruiter reached out to offer feedback. He shared details of what I did well and what I could improve on by phone.",

Basic questions testing if you can write code and know data structures. Was informed in a couple of hours that I am selected for on-site\u2026\u00a0 interview.The process to select the dates and flights, hotels was smooth. There were about 30-40 other new grad candidates and intern on the day of interview. Every new grad had just 3 coding interviews one of which was behavioral interview for checking if the candidate would be a good fit. The other two were ninja coding interviews. I had two coding questions in the behavioral round which I answered well. Two question in the first ninja round which were pretty wasy and I coded pretty quickly but messed up a basic thing in the first question. Had time for only one question in the second ninja round. This was the only tougher question in the interviews and I got the ideal answer in the end but didn't have time to finish the coding part.I think the basic mistake in the second interview and the third interview messed up my chances. I feel the company puts importance on how fast you come up with perfect answer. That's the questions are simple. So you are expected to be quick thinking and are expected to not mess up something so simple.There was lunch, awesome tour of campus and two tech talk after the interviews. This was one of the best interview days I had this season (I have had 4 on-site interview till now). No all day long torture of interviews and pretty awesome talks and tour giving an inside view of the company. Would interview again if given a chance!",

I was then flown out to their HQ in Palo\u2026\u00a0 Alto...it was the most disorganized and hectic onsite I've ever been on. First, my second interviewer was a no show since he was out of the country. Seriously? You didn't know the interviewer would be in Europe for my onsite? Then, they kept me through lunch but didn't feed me anything - which is rude. Either don't interview through lunch or take the candidate out for an informal. Otherwise, they get queasy and hungry, like I did.So, after all the onsite interviewing, they told me it looked really good and that I should hear back from them within 2 days. An offer was imminent.However, in 2 days, they told me they wanted to look at other candidates and then proceeded to jerk me around for 2 weeks. The hiring mgr even called me to do a follow up interview (even through he'd already grilled me in person). It's like they didn't know what they wanted or how to go about a professional recruiting regime.Finally, they made me an offer and acted like they were focused only on me from the beginning. Their tune changed and I found it to be disingenuous. Also, the offer compensation was insulting. Esp for an expensive place like Palo Alto. I was also interviewing with another large tech company that made me an offer and beat Facebook's offer by 30%. Now, looking back on it, this was a fantastic decision and no regrets.

(And a short coding questions in the end)2 X white board coding interviews.After the first two interviews I had lunch with this extremely nice recruiter and she also gave me a tour in the campus which was really cool.Couple of days after the on-site day I was contacted and they told me that they need to interview me some more because there was a miss match within the feedbacks I got.We set up another session of two consecutive Skype coding interviews which were really good and after couple of days I was informed that they want to send me an offer ;-)Total 7 interviews.5 of them were coding.TIPS:* Get extremely comfortable with CS undergrad material:classic algorithms, data structures, sorting, string manipulations(!!), lists, trees, basic linear algebra, working with large data sets.Don't only read about these topics - make sure you can code it, fast and accurate!!In the Skype/Phone interviews they asked me to write the code in http://collabedit.com.[I am not allowed to disclose the specific questions... sorry]* If you are reading this review then you are on the right track - I practiced only by answering questions which were posted on this site. I first tried to solve them alone, when stuck I checked the answers section and on StackOverflow.* Make sure you are well familiar with this company and its product. It will come up in every interview and especially in the manager interview.Be ready to give great answers on \"Why facebook?\" - I think all 7 interviewers asked me this question and it's really important to them.* For non US residents - Make sure you arrive to the bay area couple of days before so you'll be able to rest and beat the jet-leg. I've arrived 24 hours before, couldn't sleep because of the excitement and jet-leg, I think that being really tired (especially after lunch) affected my performances.BOTTOM LINE -Challenging for a position at FB is huge and you have to invest a lot of time and effort into it.

On-site interviews4.1 Recruiter intro/level-set4.2 Divisional Head interview4.3 Lunch interview with hiring manager4.4 Sub-divisional Head interview 14.5 Sub-divisional Head interview 24.6 C-level interview (no, not Zuckerberg, but\u2026\u00a0 close enough :-) )4.7 Hiring Manager interview #2 (because lunch was truncated for other reasons)Almost 4 weeks to the dot for response. Feedback was very positive, but not a clear fit for position (I agree too).I have over 15 years of experience working for about 10 different companies, but this interview experience will stand out in memory for a long, long time. Not a single dud interview. Each interviewer was unmistakably intelligent. Interview topics were completely free-flowing - one interview was mostly a debate on the Civil War :-) Interviewing styles were markedly different, but each interviewer knew exactly what they were looking for and most were able to get the information they wanted by making you talk about what you've done in the past, rather than just ask academic questions.Technical questions were easy, but this was for a position in Ops, so clearly not as technical as engineering interviews. Jargon in resume was deeply challenged by some interviewers. Everyone was very respectful, friendly, open, and most importantly, seemed interested in what I had to say (some were open to broad discussions, others wanted more concise answers).Only suggestion to candidates would be, shed all facades and appearances and go as yourself. I had so much fun that I wanted to interview some more! I can see how some might find the interviews daunting and the interviewers intimidating, but if you're comfortable with who you are, you'll meet some very interesting people who are deeply, deeply passionate and have an integrated outlook toward work, life and fun.Negatives: They're going through some logistical challenges in the new offices, though hardly anything out of the ordinary. Depending on who you interview with, the recruiting team may find it hard to assimilate feedback in a timely manner. Somewhat cultish adherence to principles/ideology/Zuck - practically each interviewer apologized for sounding like they'd drunk the kool-aid :) They don't yet realize that they're getting too busy for their actions to always match their words. I'm sure so far they've meant everything they said, but as they get bigger and busier, they should be a little cautious about setting expectations, particularly w.r.t time and responsiveness.Bottom-line: Truly passionate, honest, intelligent, focused workforce, but individual personalities seemed subservient to the spirit of the company. They'll get the cream of the crop, but easy to understand why some exceptionally individualistic people may turn them down without second thought.",

Even\u2026\u00a0 though there were some hard questions but they weren't something out of the blue.3rd interview was mostly about networking again there was nothing unanticipated.By that time they asked me to flew to fly to Menlo Park for onsite interviews. they paid for all my expenses and SF is a beautiful city!My interview starts at 12PM, I had 5 interviews onsite.1st interview was mostly about System and Networking, they asked me to explain as much detail as it possible that what does happend when you run \"telnet facebook.com 80\" in bash. I broke down all the steps and talked about 45 mins about it.We went for lunch2nd interview was about System administration, the guy asked me lots of question that I don't recall, the only unexpected question was what would you do if you had 1000 new servers and want to make them functional, I gave him some ideas though.3rd interview was about programming, again they just want to make sure you know how to program.4th interview, there was a guy from another IT group. His main questions were about the way I communicate to with other groups and how I would solve the problems when there are people from other groups involve.5th interviewer, I suppose he was manager of FB's SRO. He asked me some stuffs that I don't remember exactly but he wanted to know my attitudes and this kind of stuff.FYI if you are worried about the interviews you can freely ask HR about it and they usually tell you what's the interview about and you could preparer for that.",

At the end of the interview she told me what I should expect and learn about before my next interview with someone on the team.

Which wasn't really the interviewer's fault, I just got really nervous and didn't really know what to expect as this was my first real interview, ever. I'd spent so much time learning everything I could about the company, the industry and the work I hadn't thought about questions she might ask about myself, which was what most of the interview was. She asked me why I hadn't pursued something closer to my major. She asked about a time I'd had a disagreement on a team and how I'd handled it. She asked only one question specific to the work at the very end, asking me to get in the mind of a fraudster. Don't get too chatty, because it seemed a little awkward when I tried. And have prepared, general questions for the end if you are totally new/knowledgeable about the work. The questions I asked about her work she seemed confused by.",

The problem I was asked to solve looked fairly easy at face value, but I soon realized a few hours in that there were numerous edge cases that needed to be accounted for and would drastically reduce my algorithms efficiency due to nested loops. I solved the problem with a sub-optimal solution in around the time required but was denied continuation of the interview process. I wasn't given any real feedback, but I didn't ask for it either.

I had a quick screening phone interview with the recruiter, before having two technical phone interviews, where we shared a collaborative text document so that they could see what I typed. Each of the two interviews lasted about 45-60 minutes. Finally, I had a somewhat shorter (30 minute) management interview.At this point, they decided to fly me\u2026\u00a0 to Facebook for on-site interviews. I was passed from my recruiter to a coordinator who organized the on-site schedule. I flew down the night before and left the evening afterwards. All meals, transportation and lodging were paid for or expensed to Facebook.The actual on-site interviews were fun. I was given a brief tour by my coordinator, then led into a (very) small conference room with whiteboards. I had four interviews total, with lunch in-between with my coordinator. Each interview was about an hour or so. One was with a manager. One was a coding interview. Two were systems-oriented, since this was an Applications Operations Engineering (aka Site Reliability Engineering, etc.) position.Over the next several days, my coordinator was able to share a bunch of feedback from the interviewers. All four interviewers recommended a hire. I was told that there would be two meetings to make a decision. Once with the AppOps team, and once with some higher-ups for final approval.I was informed that they would keep my resume on file, but that they wouldn't be making me an offer shortly after the designated time for the second meeting. Though the message also stated that my coordinator would like to chat with me to discuss why they came to their decision, to date we've had trouble scheduling a time. Understandably, I suspect I'm less of a priority for the coordinator now that I'm not a candidate.Overall the experience was quite positive and everyone I spoke to was great. Facebook genuinely seems like a great place to work. My only complaints thus far (in chronological order) are:1. My recruiter often took a week or more to respond to my messages. Partially (though by no means entirely) as a result of this, the interview process took several months.2. I found the CS interview questions, especially those on-site, to be disappointingly easy. This may have been due to time constraints, though.3. Because of the lengths of the interviews, I had relatively little time to ask questions of the interviewers. The one exception was my last interview of the day. Because there was nothing but a debrief with my coordinator afterwards, I was able to chat more with the interviewer. This gave me a lot more insight into Facebook, and also resulted in him more strongly recommending a hire.4. To date I haven't been able to pin my coordinator down for why I wasn't offered the position.Overall, if you're given the opportunity to interview with Facebook, go for it. At the very least, the process is a lot of fun. And maybe you'll get a job at a great company!",

I had a relatively easy 30 minute call with the recruiter, which she was 10 minutes late for, where I described my background, and learned a little more about the position. I was told I would have to speak with an employee in the position\u2026\u00a0 I was interviewing for, and then the next step would be to fly me down to Austin for an in-person interview (I'm currently in NY).A couple days later, I spoke with an Account Manager who asked relatively straightforward questions about my experience, and why I was interested in Facebook. Overall, I think it was a good conversation and I was able to develop a rapport. Things started to get a little weird after this point. After the call I asked the recruiter for the Account Manager's email so I could send a Thank You, to which I received a cold response that they couldn't disclose this information. I was then told I would have to have another phone interview with another Account Manager, and that this was \"standard procedure\" despite her saying different previously.My call with the second Account Manager went find. She was a little more cold and standoffish than the first one, but it may have just been the phone interview. The call seemed to go fine, more softball questions about my experience, what I thought of the Facebook advertising product, etc, etc. I didn't get as good a vibe this time, and followed up with the recruiter at the end of the week for next steps. I got an email Monday that they would not be going forward with me as a candidate with little insight as to why.My overall impression is that the HR department at Facebook is very young and inexperienced. Being late to my call gave me a bad first impression, and their rejection email referenced the incorrect names of the people I had interviewed with from their Account team. She also referenced a different position than the one I had applied to, and to which they were recruiting when I spoke with her - I applied for a job on their Agency team, and she said the position was on their Vertical team when we spoke, though when I spoke with the Account Managers they reverted back to treating it as a position with their Agency team.

Although he seemed to really like my\u2026\u00a0 background, it went downhill with the questions that he asked, which all focus on one aspect of the position (as described, at least). The questions were all phrased as \"What is the difference between x and y?\"He told me he would submit my info to a hiring manager and get back to me within a couple days. A week later I emailed asking what was up and mentioned that I would probably be a better fit for a different position. He replied that he hadn't heard anything, and that he would ping the hiring manager again (with no reference to my asking about a different position). Two weeks after that, I still hadn't heard back, presumably because they aren't interested in me. Upon contacting the recruiter again, his email address no longer existed, so he probably left.",

After the talking, he asked me two coding question and I had to code on Collabedit. The problem difficulties were easy, but after coding he asked me to improve on certain section of the code. There was also a requirement that the code must compile. Now, I was typing on an Web Based editor without any compile option and I am not sure if its considered a big skill to have the code compile on first type.

        "details": "After applying I was contacted by a FB recruiter, who scheduled and conducted a phone interview. The recruiter was pleasant, intelligent and asked strong questions with appropriate follow-ups. This moved me to an onsite interview. They did a great job planning and managing my visit to their office. I was asked to put together a mock sales presentation with or with out a deck of slides for a product or\u2026\u00a0 service I was already familiar with. I was told I would be given 45 minutes for the mock sales call.Onsite - I showed up 10 minutes early for my appointment was taken in and informed that we would be starting the process with the mock presentation for two managers. The first manager entered and introduced himself with only his first name (more on this later). We made some small talk while we waited for the second manager, but after about 10 minutes he decided that we should carry on with out him as he had 'gotten busy with something' . Throughout the process the interviewer kept looking at his watch and finally cut me short after only 25 minutes. I later realized that they were interviewing a herd of people that day and despite being flown in at substantial expense on their part and time commitment on my part, this was a bit of a cattle call. The second interviewer (who also introduced himself by first name only) was a nice young man who essentially had the same position I was interviewing for. He asked me some questions about my sales call planning process and I asked some question about the position and the company. It is here that I found out that the position was essentially inside sales and very little time would spent with customers face to face. This made me wonder why there was such an emphasis on a mock sales call, when the position is not customer facing and primarily consists of handling clients over the phone and internet.Summary - I was scheduled to meet with 3 people but only met with 2 due to a last minute 'situation' for the third person. The onsite interview process was rushed, impersonal and oddly mysterious. I found it ironic that a company that bases its business on open disclosure and communication of it's members acts like the CIA when you ask for the names and titles of the interviewers. Neither of the people I interviewed with had business cards, both introduced themselves with only their first names and deferred me to the recruiter for their contact information. I was then told that they do not release the interviewers contact info to candidates. Really? The office environment was spartan, young and had the ambiance of a dorm room or study hall. The culture was very dedicated to the cause with a clear sense that this was more than just a job to many of the employees but also their social and personal life.

They scheduled me for an\u2026\u00a0 on-site interview a few days later but it was moved to the first week of Jan 2011 because some of the staff members were on vacation.On the day of the interview, the recruiter said that I was going to be interviewed by 5 people instead of 4! It wasn't any big deal for me because I had already prepared myself. The first interview was with 2 members who were young and started as analysts. The other 3 interviewers were mid and senior-level members. I didn't do well in one of them because the person asked really difficult questions and I had to pause and think for a minute. That person grilled me and I left the place feeling confused. The members were nice and each one told me in great detail about their job responsibilities. It was interesting hearing from each one of them on how much they enjoyed working there.I got a general rejection email from the FB team a few days later. I felt a bit upset because for 2 weeks, I was researching about the company, website and came up with ideas on how to improve the user interaction. I even prepared my Q&As in two languages (in case they were going to test my language skills). However, I'm glad to have practiced my job interview skills with 5 people.The position is still open.

She was nice enough to provide some interview tips, so I had chance to review some topics. I think fb recruiters are totally on your side.The phone interviewer was a very nice guy, he was definitely not a\u2026\u00a0 recent graduate like some other poster complained, he talked about the pre-internet boom days, so I think he has least 15 years experience.The phone screen took 45 mins.First 10-15 mins, he asked about my background and why it's a good match for the position, why I want to work in FB.Then I was asked to coding question to \"find minimum depth of a binary search tree\". It was not a hard question, any average coder could do it within 15 mins.I wrote the code with no hint or help from him. During the coding, he was mostly quite, at one point, he pointed out a possible bug which I fixed instantly. At the end, I was trying to optimize the code, he said the code would work, no need to optimize it further. Then he let me ask questions about FB about 15 mins.After the interview, I compiled the code and it really worked, didn't even have a single compile error.Next day, I received a rejection letter from the recruiter with no details.So trick is, writing the code is not enough, but your code must be very close the most optimized version known and you should be able to write 'close to perfect' code in minimum time.I googled for similar algorithms and found out my solution was well above the average, but not the best one. I guess they expect you to write something very close to best available code possible can be written, so they single out best coders.So 'move fast, break things'..",

The questions consisted of my current job, a few questions about why Facebook, and why am I looking for employment elsewhere. Another phone interview with an Investigator at Facebook. A few scenario questions about how I would approach a specific task, and a lot of \"Tell me about a time....\" questions. Definitely need\u2026\u00a0 to do your homework about Facebook, and be able to come up with ideas on how to combat it. On the day of the interview at the Palo Alto headquarters, there were two additional in person interviews with another Investigator and and Senior Investigator.The Investigators seemed very young, either in their early 20's but no older than 30. The questions pertained to fraudulent activity with Facebook credits, and how a perpetrator would benefit with Facebook credits. Highly recommended to research Facebook credits. I believe that this is the part when the interview almost seemed like ideas that would help Facebook do their jobs by obtaining ideas for free. You would think that an interview would be to evaluate if the person has the ability to adapt to the company's philosophy or be able to articulate ideas. I may not have been right on point with Facebook credits, but I felt I displayed a great deal of professionalism and knowledge of the field of Fraud. There were a lot of questions of how you would approach fraud on Facebook credits, and the ideas that I presented and how I would approach the issue were reasonable and developed well.I did not get the job, which seemed odd to me because I have more experience in the industry than the interviewers put together. During their introduction, they both shared where they came from before Facebook, and both said that it was their first job out of college, 6 months ago, and 2 years ago. However, they were professional and courteous, and seemed very knowledgeable in their fields.",

Anyway, after discussing my more recent projects, we moved on to the whiteboard coding part of the interview. This part was a pleasant surprise. It was done in a collaborative way, where I would discuss my solution, psudo-code, then code, and receive suggestions or other form of input from the engineer. The last 15 minutes were spent discussing the culture at Facebook and specifics about the team I was interviewing for. It took them more than a week to get back to me, which I would like to think was because they wanted to complete interviews for the other candidates.",

        "details": "First I had a phone interview. The question was fairly straight-forward (multiply two very large numbers given as Strings) and the interviewer wasn't looking for any tricks or anything like that to solve. Like others have mentioned, quick clean code seems to be the key. Unfortunately, the interviewer had a very thick East Asian accent and talking over the phone just made things worse. I had to ask him to\u2026\u00a0 repeat quite a few times. It was probably me but at times I couldn't even tell when he'd asked a question because of the inflection! It must've gone well enough though because I got an on-site call.The on-site was two interviews of 45 min each. In the first one, I took a bit of a hit because a) I couldn't see the solution right away b) it took me a while to get up to speed and code the thing - I did manage to finish it though and it seemed (relatively) bug-free. Again, as lots of people have mentioned, the interviewer seemed quite young, just a year or so out of school and he didn't offer much in terms of feedback - positive or negative - as the interview progressed. Once he'd given me the question and given me the hint that got me started, he was busy with his iPhone, rarely looking up. That kinda sucked.The second interviewer was much nicer - probably one of the best ones I've interviewed with - lots of feedback, lots of encouragement, was accepting of different trains of thought and non-standard answers. Seemed like a really nice guy too.Overall, it seems to be the case with Facebook thata) Your interview really depends on who you getb) They seem to value quick-clean-bug free-optimized code at the first try more than anything elsec) Questions are of average to above-average difficulty (if you've prepared!)",

We were required to answer a few short essay questions like explaining how to use certain features on Facebook and what we would change, along with our resume. (It was to test our writing skills.)Less than a week later, I got a call from my school's career center saying\u2026\u00a0 I needed to schedule for an interview in a couple of days.At the interview, I was incredibly nervous. It was my first interview, and I had no idea what the job entailed. The job description was vague.The interviewer was changed at the last minute. HR was supposed interview me, but the manager of platform operations (if memory serves me right) decided to interview everyone that day, so that made me even more nervous. She asked me probably 25-30 questions, and I felt like we were having a staring contest. After every answer I gave, she would stare at me stone-faced for several seconds until I said,\"That's it,\" before typing my answer down in her notes. Very awkward experience.By the end of the interview, I realized I was (unfortunately) overqualified for the job. It also turned out to be a non-technical position with no room to move up. We ended things on a good note once I started asking her questions about her experience at Facebook. She warmed up quite a bit.One thing I can tell people to make sure they do is: always compliment or have positive things to say about Facebook. Obvious advice, but they really like it. Oh, and don't mention Google or any other company at all, unless they ask who their rivals are. Even mentioning \"'googling' something\" seemed to make my interviewer cringe. (I made some rookie errors, since it was my first interview.)I'd say the difficulty of the questions was about average, but the non-stop staring made the interview even harder as I had to maintain constant eye contact.",

        "details": "I had applied online to Facebook through their site mid-July. However, only after I had applied and was interested in another position one week later, I was not able - exclusively because I had applied to another position previously. That was strike one.I was contacted in early August for a position at Facebook. I was asked to submit a lengthy evaluation, composing a mock response letter about fraud. Another two\u2026\u00a0 or three weeks later, a phone interview was scheduled. Still, the recruiter sent an e-mail at the time of the phone interview to reschedule for later in the afternoon. Later in the afternoon, the recruiter called late without apologizing for wasting prospective employees' time. The interview ran long, too. No hints during or after the initial phone interview concerning the next interview processes either.Over one week later, moving now into early September, a different recruiter was supposed to schedule an on-site visit to the Austin office. Never was told when or where to show up. Instead, I was contacted two days after I was supposed to have the on-site for yet another phone interview. In the confirmation e-mail, I was informed the recruiter would be from the Austin office. Nevertheless, when I asked on the phone specific questions about the office, I was told this recruiter was in California and had hardly an idea about the office. Still, the recruiter was very interested in me and wanted to continue the process. I followed up about one week later about the status of the next process and received no response. Again, another week later I called and received no return call. I was extended an offer by another company and pretty much forgot about Facebook....Until now...two months later....Now into November, I received a random e-mail from the first recruiter, whom I have not spoken to in over two and a half months. The note was the following:\"Thanks for your interest in working at Facebook and apologies for the delay on getting back to you. We\u2019re always on the lookout for the best talent and although we\u2019re interested in your skills and background, it's not quite a fit for the positions that we have open right now.\"It is absolutely unacceptable for a company to wait over two months to send any correspondence about a recruiting decision. All in all, Facebook's recruiting process extremely unprofessional and inappropriate. It is unfortunate to see a prospering company not properly investing in the future of their company for the long-term.Strikes against Facebook:1. Ability to only apply to one position at time of application2. Unnecessary evaluation processes3. Miscommunication within the company4. Miscommunication with prospective employees5. Absurdly lengthy recruiting timelines6. Disrespectful, unprofessional, and inappropriate approach to interviews",

Not even the question itself but the whole experience, you feel bad if you make a typo (and i did many silly typos that I usually do not make when writing code), because she can see your typing in real time. Also, you cannot debug or anything.. In the end, to understand my idea of a solution, she gave me an example input and asked to traverse it using my code. After getting an idea she said, ok, almost correct, you could find a bug in 10 mins, ya, but we gotta end now.Next day the original recruiter emailed me saying that they wouldn't take me.

She asked if I was available Weds or Thurs. I said yes, she said she would email me before then. --- Thurs came around and never got an email. So, I emailed her asking about it and she set it up the next day.- Got the call the next day - the girl was very nice and knowledgeable. The interview went really good in both directions. I really was sure I had an in person interview next. She said to contact the same HR girl from Austin.- A week went by and I got an email from her and she wrote that I fit the part, but they have alot of candidates and I would not be moving forward with me.In all honesty I was shocked. I'm not sure if its the HR in Austin or Facebook, but it was an odd experience and felt like something is going on with the interviews or the process. Very strange. I thought this from really talking with the HR girl that thought she knew it all.Yea I would of loved to work at Facebook, but after going with the interview process, not so much.

I'll admit to having somewhat of an off-day at the on-site. I completely fumbled the \"are there any bugs in your code\" question with at least one of the interviewers; I said there wasn't, but there was a pretty obvious bug once he described the failure mode to me.There was a scheduling mix-up with at least one of my interviewers, which caused my time with him to be cut short. I'm sure that didn't help with him getting a good feel for me for the sake of his interview feedback.The culture seems a bit more corporatey than the recruiting buzz might put forward; it seems geared toward people who want to have one foot in the startup pond while having the other firmly planted on the dry land of large, relatively safe organization. There are a lot of small teams, and the reflection I got is that there is a non-negligible amount of bureaucracy weighing on the organization. I guess when you get to 1000 people, that will happen.The office space is a mostly open floor plan, and the gear the developers are provided to work on is really good stuff.But that's an initial impression, and things are not always as they appear.So yeah, weirdness in the interview scheduling and such dragged down my impression, but I'd probably give the dice another roll if the chance comes up again.

Standard algorithm questions which I answered correctly. Afterward,\u2026\u00a0 the recruiter said it went well and that she would be in contact with me about what the next steps are. A week goes by and she calls me back telling me I have to write an Adobe Air or Java application using the Facebook API's.I thought it was a little bit much for them to ask me to spend my time writing something I would not be getting paid for. I really wanted to get the job and impress the hiring manager though so I spent my free time, over a two week period making something that looked great and worked really well. It then took them two months to review the application. To me this was totally unprofessional and kind of a slap in the face. The recruiter was in contact with me the whole time and told me they were all busy with their big change to the privacy features.Finally the hiring manager looked at the application but the recruiter told me they wanted someone else internal to look at the code as well. She told me they were impressed with the application and had rejected a lot of other candidates applications right away. I sat in limbo another few weeks while another person looked at the application. The recruiter then calls me back to tell me that the position I was applying for was dropped. Not that they hired someone else, but that they changed the role I was applying for completely. I think the software engineering interview process has hit an all time low.First they make the engineer jump through hoops of logic games. Then spout out algorithms and uses of design patterns like robots. Finally you have to spend your free time writing something that they are only going to throw in the garbage.

They were very heady, but really fun stuff-->)1. Pick a product on Facebook. Please describe the logical data model for related fact and dimension tables, the aggregation tables\u2026\u00a0 you'd want to build for analytics, and the dashboard you'd build to monitor the product.2. Facebook has over 300 million users from around the world and from all demographics. How would you build a model to determine 1yr and lifetime value per user?3. What KPIs would you define to measure the engagement of a cohort of Facebook users? What levers would you build to help improve the KPIs?4. How would you build a state transition model to track the state of a Facebook advertiser?I answered 2 of them and posted my answers on the web.Then I received a call from the Hiring Manager who asked me:1. If I were the CEO of Facebook, who would I say were the competitors...2. What are the odds of rolling a 4 if you have two dice.3. How would you create a model to build a database of all user's possible nicknames4. One more, I forgot...Question 2 I had troubles with, even though I knew that there would be some sort of brain teaser question as part of the interview. I believe that I now know the answer (look at each dice as if it were the same die, not two distinct odds sets e.g. first roll odds 1 out of 6, second dice odds 1 out of 5 (because one side has been subtracted for the first roll). Question 3 the interviewer did not let up on my approach, although I offered several solutions, which he volleyed back at, even though some of his assumptions were specious. I wanted to offer that there were many, many other ways to improve \"user experience\" that held priority over user's being able to find friends via nicknames, but I did not want to appear to be contrarian. It was apparent by the end of the interview and the competitive nature of the interviewer that I would not be receiving an offer.In conclusion, although the subject matter was highly technical and involved some great problem solving, I did not find the interview process to be all that difficult. However, I found the unforgiving framework to be unrealistic. The reality is that most intelligent people aren't always necessarily quick to the reply (otherwise businesses would increasingly have employees working from home via Twitter 140 character exchanges) and more emphasis should be place on the overall impression from the pre-screen take home questions; work days are no less than 8-hours, not 8-seconds. Although the job description called for my balance between technical, analytical, business and marketing savvy, I ended up feeling that the interviewer wanted another programmer, just like himself.",

I say this to give you an understanding of my state of mind. I agreed to be presented and submit my resume because it's Facebook, right?I was passed to an in house recruiter to schedule a phone interview with another in house recruiter. I spoke to the\u2026\u00a0 in house recruiter for 30 minutes. I was surprised. The recruiter was pretty thorough with the preliminary tech stuff. I was told I would be contacted if they wanted to move me forward.Two weeks passed and the original independent recruiter said they weren't interested. What's even more fascinating is this independent recruiter basically said the staff there were very arrogant!Fast forward two months and I get contacted directly from an in house recruiter that verified i never spoke with any facebook IT staff. She set up another phone interview with in house staff.( Anyone else starting to get uncomfortable?)I then received an email confirming the phone interview from yet another in house recruiter(good lord, how many recruiters do you really need?) and asking me to email back my confirmation.Phone interview with in house staff went smoothly. They asked me about my experience and I was very comfortable since I have extensive experience. I did admit to being out of touch with the email technology because I have other peers that do the day to day stuff. They really need an email admin. In my opinion, if that's the case, drop the rest of the job description. People who do email at companies with 2000+ employees have very little time to be really good at much else. We covered standard windows admin stuff and afterwards, he said the recruiter would be in touch.That's when the entire process fell off the tracks. I never heard back from anyone from Facebook. I figured oh well.That is until my coworker and I started comparing notes. Turns out he had also been contacted! We sit across from each other for goodness sakes! We determined between the two of us that Facebook's internal staff has been trying to fill this same position for 6+ months. It appears they may have hired and fired two people for the position already. After my phone interview, the position seemed to have gotten changed to a contract to hire position! That was early 2010. The position is back on their site again right now.The valley is kinda small when it comes to experienced admins so my friends and I have been passing the info around. For those of us with families, this could potentially be a risky position.At the end of the day, it doesn't matter. It's Facebook and they will eventually go IPO. If you get the job, suck it up and count yourself lucky(and soon to be millionaire!)",

I then went in for a day with two 45-minute interviews, followed by a day with 3 interviews. Due to scheduling constraints, they scheduled next-day interviews (!), but as a result, one of the interviewers didn't show and I had to go find the recruiter, who found me someone else after a\u2026\u00a0 bit of apology and hassle.The interviews tended to be very similar. First, I'd be asked to talk about some sort of interesting research I did. After that, I'd have one or more algorithm/coding questions, where the first part would be to explain the solution to some algorithmic problem, and the second part would be to code it up. Sometimes one of the parts would be omitted, but every interviewer wanted to see code on the whiteboard.I liked the open feel of the office and culture, but found that people seemed more driven by the company's success and profit than by the fun problems they got to work on, which left me a little less attracted. However, for someone with more interest in business success than I have, that might be ideal. I'm sure there are interesting problems there, and there are plenty of smart people and it's a flexible environment. The vacation time is among the best, though other benefits are still lacking (e.g. investment matching). Compensation included a large proportion of stock grants, the value of which is still uncertain.Due to my timidity, I did not engage in any compensation negotiation, and my recruiter did not bring up the possibility of increasing it, which surprised me given that they knew I had a competing offer.

This was a 4 to 5 hour time slot, so pretty much your whole day is done. 1st interview was mostly business analysts questions/personality dynamic questions, i.e., how you would handle a conflict situation with senior technical staff, etc. Next interview was with the hiring manager, which I thought I handled pretty well. Next interview was with the senior person, which on a scale of 1-10, I would say was a 7. Final interview was with the design architect. To be honest, I have been to several interviews, and this one was no different and thought I did quite well. Got a response 1 week later, saying they decided to pass. At this point, hoping to not to sound like sour grapes, but its a very young company, and they obviously do not have a streamlined and efficient process on how to select people.

Content of the questions varied from riddles to database design. My impression of the first three engineers was good, they seemed like nice guys, and knowledgeable. The last interviewer came off as pretentious, I felt as though he wanted me to fail -- just my opinion!Overall, the office culture seemed relaxed and the problems they are solving there are interesting ones.

He was not clear for some of the questions. He was doing some other stuff when I was coding. From the starting he was in rush, he didn't give proper time to code or even didn't discuss the proper test cases of a program with me. He just put some questions on the text area and just asked me what is your approach? Even he didn't run my code or didn't check it syntactically or logically.After an hour I got the rejection. Still, I don't know what he was expecting from coding round or why I got the rejection. My entire process took around 2 and half months and during that, they just took my two interviews. Totally unhappy with the Facebook's recruitment process.",

All but one interviewers had an attitude \"let's get it over with\" My impression was that there was already a candidate chosen for the role either internally or externally but for some reason the recruiter decided to waste my time and carry on the 2hr 1:1 interview. Questions ranged from \"describe a project you worked on\" and \"what do you like working on\" to \"what do you think we do day to day in our department\" - as generic as it gets. No business cases or hypothetical scenarios, all past performance and role-specific questions.I've received a rejection email after 12hrs so that only makes me more confident that my application was rejected before I even said hello.

All 3 rounds covered different problems and the last round was a fitment round which was kind of managerial round, and I was asked more scenario based questions to check my work style and attitude.

The call took place at around 7pm in the evening (UK time) with a staff member in one of the US\u2026\u00a0 offices.The recruiter messed me about a little arranging a call for a particular date (which I spent time preparing for) and then nobody called or got in touch to tell me it was not happening. The next day I got an official email from somebody at Facebook with details about a video conference call (the recruiter told me it would be by phone) and it was properly arranged for five days later.The video call interview itself was good and quite relaxed. The recruiter was meant to have asked me a series of questions about my skill set previously (qualitative vs quantitative research strengths) which had not been completed so the interviewer had to rush through that part. The answers you give influence the questions they ask you in the interview. Subsequently, because this bit was rushed, I was categorised as more of a qualitative researcher, which isn't really accurate. They might have established that with a bit more time to talk about my skill set.The interviewer asked me about an app I liked, then gave me a scenario about how I would plan a research project in three weeks to answer an engagement question.One piece of advice: listen to the pre-interview instructions about not preparing beforehand. Because I spent time preparing, I ended up trying to tell the interviewer everything I knew about user research instead of focusing in on the task the interviewer gave me. I knew I had not done my best at interview so was not surprised not to get an offer.The post-interview feedback I got was odd though as it said although I had UX knowledge required they were looking for somebody with more experience in the \"product world\". As I hadn't been asked anything about my work experience during the interview it did make me wonder why they had not established from my CV that I did not have the particular work experience they required prior to interview, during the initial screening. Overall an odd experience. Decent interview but bad comms from recruiter.Facebook seems like a great place to be UX researcher so good luck to others trying!",

I had the chance to discover more about the team and I was very pleased by the kindness of the recruiter.I then moved to a second stage, a video interview with a team member in language (French) over BlueJeans (similar to Skype). What can I\u2026\u00a0 say? I did several interviews for tech companies and this was the worst experience I ever had. The interviewer seemed to be upset, she was very cold, unfriendly, overall she seemed very pissed off to be there.I did not like few things in her behavior:1) after I talked about my current job she commented out of the blue that my job was very \"variegated\" - I still need to understand if it was a negative or positive comment, but the first thing an interviewer shouldn't do is to add useless comments during an interview.2) I did not know if she was taking notes or just writing to other people, she did not bother telling me what she was doing on her computer3) When I asked her a question about the team (I asked her to tell me how a day in the role of Escalation Specialist looks like) she just answered \"I don't understand what you mean\". This put extra pressure on me, I had to rephrase the question and she just answered that \"every day it's different in this role\". She did not show any excitement for her role, no passion at all, she was just very cold, and above all she didn't answer my question.I was 100% sure that she would reject me and this happened after 2 weeks. I was relieved not to proceed further, I would not enjoy working in an environment where this is the atmosphere. Also, funny thing, the recruiter sent me an automatic e-mail to inform me that I was rejected, and few minutes later she sent me another e-mail with the same content but with that was meant for someone else. Negatively impressed overall, I would not recommend to interview for this team (or company, if this is generalized).",

A few days later I had a really great 90 minute interview / chat with a design manager in the Menlo Park office. After that, he put me straight through to the final round of interviews and asked me to fly out to\u2026\u00a0 California for onsite interviews. However I decided I'd be more interested in their London office instead of Menlo Park, so I got transferred to their London recruitment.A couple of months later I had a video call with a recruiter from London who was much more knowledgable in design. She put me through to two 45 minute interviews with designers in London, which I was a bit surprised about, as it seemed like the recruitment process I went through in Menlo Park counted for nothing in London.The first interview was an app critique which I enjoyed. The interviewer was very bubbly and worked hard to sell me on London and Facebook. However my second interview was incredibly disappointing and put me off the role entirely.The interviewer was very negative about pretty much everything. It felt like he would rather be somewhere else. Both these interviewers were also from a team I had expressed no interest in, so during this phase I learned nothing about the team I had genuine interest for.The recruiter got back to me promptly and said I wasn't a good fit for the roles they were looking for at that time. She asked for feedback on the interview process so I emailed her a longer version of what I said above.I never heard back from her. Clearly they don't like getting critical feedback of their interview process, so now I know all I need to know about Facebook!",

The next test is phone interview with the recruiter asking some basic stuffs, what do you\u2026\u00a0 know about the role, etc. After that, I got a user interview, asking about what I'm gonna do on certain circumstances. After passing this phase, the final interview was quite tough I must say (they gave me several days to prepare though). I was asked to make a presentation on a given topic. There were some interviewers that perhaps gonna asked you questions related to your presentation. It was totally draining my energy and emotion (2 hours in total).

        "details": "Here's my opinion from my experience interviewing at Facebook.They tell you the process in advance. One phone interview, 5 in house interviews (3 coding, 1 design and 1 behavioural). All interviews are 45 minutes each and one-on-one, and you have to write code in all of the coding interviews, and possibly in the design one too. In the first round, one person decides whether you get through or not. In\u2026\u00a0 the 5 rounds, each interviewer provides their feedback after you have finished the interviews which means that if you do badly in one then the other interviewers won't actually know.Be fully aware, and make no mistake about this - there is an incredibly high possibility that you will get rejected. That sounds harsh but consider it from their position - huge numbers of people apply, huge numbers get interviewed, and they have to pick people out somehow. They also say that they prefer to avoid hiring the wrong person so ultimately they end up inadvertantly rejecting good candidates incase they turn out to be a bad hire, so the risk of getting rejecting is even higher. Basically, this means you are most likely going to be wasting a ridiculous amount of your time and effort. Perhaps because of this, they are incredibly nice and friendly. This really was the nicest and most pleasant interview I have had.Also, once you understand the scenario, it really helps to kill your nerves if you suffer from that. After all, why stress about something you have practically no chance of succeeding in? Negative, true, but the odds are really stacked against you and you would do well to understand that and just be yourself.The questions are not that hard, I found. In fact, I solved the first one so quickly I even surprised myself. You do have to write on the whiteboard, but that of course means that there can not be much code to write since a whiteboard is not that big. Indeed the questions are not that hard really. I felt that they do expect you to talk about what you are doing but also to get it right very quickly and without any mistakes. They want to see how you approach the problem etc., but get real - they don't want to see you fumbling around, they want to see that you know the answer and can bang it out.Ultimately, even if you know the answer to the technical questions and you get them right you will still likely fail over something you can't really control or even know about. In my case, they said I didn't have management experience, but you know what, I didn't apply for a manager role and they never even asked about management or leadership at all. I was pretty annoyed to be honest, it felt like a complete waste of my time and I felt like an idiot for worrying so much about the interviews.They do provide you with some preparation links which are useful. There is also a book called Cracking The Coding Interview. It doesn't have their questions in it of course, but it gives you plenty of examples on how to solve these kinds of questions so if you read up on it you should be able to bang them out quite easily.Overall, it is worth going just to see if you can handle it because you probably can! Just make sure that you feel good about what you achieved even if they say no.",

I felt it was just because one person on the team did not like me. I think Facebook is only open when it fits its needs or narrative. So just don't believed the \"Open and Connected\" thing as I did, even more when you sign an NDA.So basically even if you have the skills set and you did great interviews, if someone in the team does want to work with you for whatever reason, you will not be selected. Maybe it is just part of \"Team building\" but I just think it is unfair and discriminatory somehow.I'm very discouraged from ever retrying to interview for Facebook.Maybe this was the intent, so that only the most determined would remain. But the impression that Facebook recruiting has made is really messy and frustrating from the managers' part. (HR was always nice and helpful).I clearly advice against applying there if you don't have inside contacts there, unless you just want to waste 3 months of your time doing tests and presentation.

        "details": "I applied online and was approached by the HR to initiate the interview process. My next interview was a technical one and I had hoped to clear it, but failed. The interviewer was helpful, but failed to see my perspective. I initially approached to solve the problem in O(N) time using an algorithm that I thought I knew. But I got confused and 15 mins in the interview, I asked\u2026\u00a0 whether I could use another approach. This is when I got shaky. I proposed a solution in O(N^2) time. He asked to make it faster and using Hash Tables, I improved the time to O(N) and space to O(N). And with a hint from the interviewer, I ended up solving in O(N) time with constant space (and then started writing the code). During the whole interview session, I accidentally kept confusing things (for instance calling a node,a root node because I was thinking in terms of sub-trees and recursively). This generally doesn't happen even when working under stress. I felt the interviewer grossly underestimated me, but I blame myself for that. If there is anything I would different then it would be to use the easiest approach to solution the question first. A positive start boosts up the confidence. Make sure to explain CLEARLY (using the correct terminology) how to tackle the problem. One more thing: embrace the fact that there is always a possibility of getting rejected. So, blurt out whatever you solution you think should work. There is not enough time to derive your approach. And be confident. Sometimes you can trick the interviewer into believing that you know exactly what to do, even when you don't (if you are close enough).",

At this point, I emailed to rescind my interest, which was responded to that the other role is not happening..Not a great experience as a result of a very bad HR rep..",

I believe it was around 1.5hr, but the test can be\u2026\u00a0 done in less time, so you don't have to rush as on oth2nd step is the phone interview by the HR recruiter, mostly to check if you are not a complete wacko, also they try to check if you have some basic skills for the job. It took around 15-20min3rd step is another phone interview with one of the team members. It took an hour, and it was checking the logical reasoning4th step is a 3 back-to-back interviews. First two were very easy going, but the third one was with two colleagues in which one was doing all the talking. I guess they were using the tactic of good cop/bad cop, but it was just the bad cop, because the good cop was too afraid of the bad cop :) anyway, after that interview I had a bad feeling I did something wrong, and eventually I got the email stating they chose another candidate. Lucky me, in a few days I got a much better offer from a another company so my job changing story had a happy end.All in all, the interview process was very nice. After each step I would get a feedback from the HR recruiter and she would tell me what did I do wrong and what did I do good. Also they would send me some general guidelines on how to prepare for each step, which I think is very cool. However, one negative remark. They would call me after each step to give me feedback, which is a very cool thing, but then after the last interview I got the usual \"thank you for applying\" email, which is not according to the expectation they create by giving you feedback after each step. At least they could've called after I reached the last round. I guess they haven't interviewed too many people for the last round.",

About a week after that the recruiter told me I was going to be interviewed. He also included a bunch of URLs to read so I would be familiar with the Facebook interview style.The interview was setup by a coordinator. Two\u2026\u00a0 days later the interview took place over the phone.The interviewer introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself by discussing my favorite project. He said my resume was too extensive to discuss. I worked in Silicon Valley for 5 years and have a significant background in software engineering. There was no discussion of the Kaggle competition.He then presented a puzzle. It involved a grid with the letters X, O, and G. X were walls, O were rooms, and G were guards. I had to create an algorithm that computed the the shortest path to each room from a guard. So if it took a guard 3 steps to reach a room, and another guard 2 steps, then you would only keep the 2. The grid was variable size (N x N).The task was to design the algorithm and then code it up in a shared web page. I had about 35 minutes to complete the puzzle.I wasn't able to get it completed. The next day I thought about it while eating lunch and the best way to solve it became clear. I was definitely on the right track during the interview, but it was simply incomplete.The puzzle itself wasn't amazingly hard. It's just the time constraints. I needed another 20 minutes or so to get it done right.A few days later I was told my background was not what they were looking for. This was a really strange thing to say because my background was never discussed. There is no doubt in my mind that my background is strong enough to work at facebook. As a matter of fact, after seeing the skills of the interviewing engineer (I looked him up on LinkedIn), I feel I'm over qualified.A few observations...This was the first time I've been interviewed by someone with significantly less experience than myself.Your past experience is irrelevant. I could have helped Steve Jobs invent the iphone but if you can't solve the puzzle then you'll be passed over.While I was working on the puzzle the interviewer gave me a \"tip\". It turns out that the tip was incorrect. I'm 100% positive that using an efficient solution is completely incompatible with the tip he gave me. Maybe it was part of the test.If you're good at puzzles and have a solid understand of software development, but not a lot of experience, then you should go apply.My personal impression is that they're looking for younger less experienced people. My interviewer started out as an intern so that seems to be a good alternative if you're still in college.",

Then a few days later I received an email scheduling the next phone interview.The interviewer was a designer at Facebook - pretty friendly, and explained what he was currently working on, and then asked me what phone I was using. Then I was asked to put on headphones and keep the phone in front of me and answer very specific questions for about half an hour, about iOS settings, and methods of measuring user engagement, etc. There was also a hypothetical design problem given to me, and I had to then defend my design decisions and justify why I chose each interaction that I did.The next interview was scheduled a couple of weeks later, and that was supposed to be a critique of my work - but it was pretty conversational, and basically an opportunity for me to explain recent projects that I had enjoyed most. And on a specific project, I was asked to explain at length my design process and UX decisions, and whether there was anything I would have done differently. This was also followed by a friendly discussion of the work culture, and I was asked if I had any questions.

I was asked to solve an easy coding problem, I finished it very quickly but made a small mistake in analyzing the complexity. I only found that mistake after the interview. The interviewer is very experienced, I have a great time talking to him after the coding phrase.Then I got a chance to onsite. I had 3 interviews. 2 interviewers asked coding problems and 1 asked coding problems and also talked about my projects in resume. The problems are harder than the problem in phone interview. I really struggled at 1 of them. But I think I did a good job at another ones. The interviewer who talking with me about my projects is from a strong background and seems a little tough, I must say I was very nervous when talking to him, but luckily it turned out well.In overall, the recruiters and the interviewers are all very nice.

After a few weeks, I was invited to a phone interview, which went quite smoothly (typical questions about my background).

When the process resumed, it had been handed over to a\u2026\u00a0 different interviewer, to whom my CV was passed on. This next interviewer contacted me in order to arrange another phone interview. This time around, the process was a lot quicker \u2013 just one phone call and I was invited to Facebook's HQ in Dublin for an interview day. All expenses were paid for by the company except for meals and transportation.I arrived at Dublin on a Sunday and the interview day was on Monday. It was super-quick \u2013 less than 2 hours and 4 interviewers from Account Management, Partner Management, Client Services and the Regional Director. In my opinion, the questions they asked were too thoughtful and mind-draining for such little time and the position itself, and honestly, sometimes I did not know how to answer them. The hardest part was the last one with the regional director. I sensed from the first moment he didn't enjoyed being there. \"Tell me something that's not in your CV\", \"Why should I hire you\", \"Do you like football.\" I asked what was he looking for in a candidate and his answer was \"we're looking for bold people who can make an impression.\" (As if he just read that.) After we were finished, he simply left the meeting room and I had to find my way to the exit from a 3rd floor myself, and to the airport.But other than that, it was an interesting experience although it felt like getting the on-site interview was just a matter of luck.",

I applied and the recruiter contacted me in less than a week. She was super friendly and flexible so we arranged a Skype interview on a date that worked for me.On the first interview the interviewer was late for about half an hour, he\u2026\u00a0 apologized and I said it was okay and it went fine. I was asked 2 questions about data structures, one of which was from the book I was preparing from. The next day I got an e-mail from the recruiter that they wanted another interview and once again they worked around my schedule. All the way through my recruiter was very fast when it comes to sending e-mails.The second interview went a bit worse than the first one, far from a perfect interview. I got two questions again and the interviewer didn't give me plenty of time to think. For example, the interviewer pointed to wrong things in my code before I said I was done with it. After I said I was done with the code, I was asked whether I can make it better, so I did make it better, but I was given a hint before I started coding even though I would probably come to that conclusion, but I guess that the interviewer wanted the interview to move a little faster than I was most comfortable. Anyways, I coded the better solution. Then I was said that there exists a better solution and I didn't know how to make it even better, so I said that I would have to think about it, but we were right about to be out of time so we stopped. I was also said that I can expect to hear from my recruiter within a week.My recruiter, who was very fast in answering up to this point, didn't contact me at all. I was a bit dissappointed because I thought I didn't pass the interview. I waited for a little more than a week and then sent an e-mail to ask whether there are any news. The next day she responded and apologized for not contacting me (she said there were some issues with the recruiting tool). And later they told me that I passed through. So I guess I wouldn't get it if I didn't ping my recruiter, so don't be afraid to do it, I was weighing to send an e-mail or not :)",

Some common questions to understand if I fit the position, is it interesting for me, etc. Very nice person easy to talk with. She was totally ok with moving interview time to adjust to my time zone and was just in time.After one week I\u2026\u00a0 got second interview with a Product Designer which lasted 55 minutes.Some background related questions, the process of my work, etc. Then she picked one of my projects and asked many questions like why did you do this or that, why this order, how to do this or that action, do you need to teach your user to do it, etc. This interviewer was more serious lady, but made a good impression either.To be honest I thought it went well, but after one more week I got a mail from Product Design hiring manager, that we're not going to continue, I don't fit the position.She gladly agreed to have another call to give me a feedback on my interview, which I really appreciate! The reason is I think more about how it looks rather then how it works.Lately I analysed the project I was asked about, it had problems with OS guidelines, I used some stuff from Android world in iOS app.I'll fix it, add more properly made projects to portfolio and will try again.Good luck everyone )",

Now, in my interview, I was first asked about the best experience I have had in\u2026\u00a0 my last two years. Then, the interviewer quickly moved on to the coding questions. There were two questions for which I had to explain my solution and then code it on the whit board. I was able to both the questions, but I guess the interviewer might not have liked the way I had explained my approach as I was not called for the next interview. The interviewer was not very vocal and did not really participate in the discussion where you explain the approach. That is why it becomes difficult to detect if the interviewer is understanding your words or not. Anyways, it was a some experience.",

I found out there were going to be two 45 minute phone interviews and if I passed both, I will be brought on site in their Menlo\u2026\u00a0 Park location for some more interviews.The first is a programming interview, in the language of your choice, using collabedit. You'll be asked to write a function and a small program that do different things. They will not actually run the code, but rather speak with you about what you've written down. The tasks were pretty basic, so I assume they also follow your general attitude towards the problems and how you structure everything and present what you are doing.The interviewer is not allowed to give direct feedback but you'll probably know if he's got a good feeling or not. After about a week I got an email telling me that I've passed and I scheduled my second phone interview.\u00a0The second phone interview is a linux systems administration interview, also using (when needed) collabedit. This is a pretty thorough interview and the questions go as deep as the linux kernel. You'll have to know how things like how the bash interpreter works, process forking and killing, memory management, process tracing and debugging.My systems administration knowledge is not that deep so this interview did not go as well.",

The second was significantly harder than the first, a complex array algorithm. I worked my way through it on the board but my solution was non-ideal in time complexity after analysis. He suggested we rework it.

HR decided not to proceed further in the process. The feedback was that the interviewer had hoped to get more on product vision. I have been interviewing, hiring and building teams for years now and I am not really sure how anyone can assess one's product vision in a 25-minute phone interview. I found the overall experience very unprofessional and somehow disrespectful to the candidate (well to me\u2026).

She told me that the hiring manager was in London in two days time so we had to move quickly. Oh, and the job description online has now changed - they require someone with different sector specialism and technical product experience. We spent 30 mins talking through my CV, why I wanted to work for Facebook and what I thought I could bring to the role, but it was clear that the goal posts had moved and I was no longer suitable for the role...

        "details": "I was contacted by a recruiting agency for software engineering position at Facebook, and after I told them I was willing to apply, my resume was forwarded to Facebook's recruiter. Next day, I got an email from the FB recruiter with a link to an online coding test on interviewstreet. This test was for one hour duration, designed to test coding skills of the interviewer. It was a string parsing\u2026\u00a0 problem and code could be written in any language and we'd just need to submit the output on a given input set. I got an email later from the Facebook people that I passed that test and would need to do a phone interview. My phone interview was scheduled in a week.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An engineer called me up for the phone interview and asked about my work projects. I explained to him briefly and also got to know a little about his work at Facebook. He then followed onto the technical interviewing part and posed a problem for me. We were working on a shared document for this part. This was a problem about the classic binary search tree data structure, like an RB Tree. I coded a simple solution and I was asked to analyse its runtime complexity. I analysed the complexity and was able to put it in Big O notation. He was satisfied with that solution and then moved onto talking about his work, what Facebook is expecting from the candidates and such. The conversation quickly ended after that . A couple weeks later, their recruiter informed me that I passed the phone interview and would be scheduled personal interviews.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About a month after my phone interview, it was the day for the personal interviews and I was flown into their interviewing location. I had two technical interviews that day and another general, informal get-to-know-you-and-your-work type of interview. For technical interviews, code was to be written on a whiteboard. In one of the technical interviews, I was told to come up with an algorithm for a variation of the classic knapsack problem. This could be solved with a dynamic programming and I coded the same on the whiteboard. It's important to explain how the solution was arrived at. After coding it up, I was asked to analyse its complexity. I'd written a recursive solution and I could only write a recurrence relation for the complexity function, not a closed form. I also told him that an interative solution is also possible and wrote it out too. Being an iterative code, with a simple nested loop, it was also easy to analyse its complexity. The interviewer was actually ok with the recurrence relation for the complexity and didn't bug me on an exact form. He seemed satisfied with my solution and then we moved onto general topics. Interview was quickly over after that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the second technical interview, I was asked a problem on balanced binary search trees. I'd previously implemented an RB Tree and that experience helped me very much for this interview. Without this experience, I couldn't have solved that problem and would've been rejected. I was asked the classic interview problem on sorted-but-rotated array. I knew the solution for this one and it involved binary search. I wrote the solution for this one and the interview was quickly over after that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was told to provide 3 personal references on that day and left for home. About 2 weeks later, I was informed that there would be another technical interview. In this interview, I was asked to implement a simple regex parser. Conceptually, some what simpler than the other interviews, but getting the implementation correct was tricky for this one. I got it right and he was satisfied with the code. I was also then asked about the runtime complexity for the solution. I left the interview confidently.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A week later, I was offered the job. Generally speaking, good programming skills help a lot in getting this job. On top of that, I'd suggest reading the CS algorithms textbook by Cormen. Writing good code, with a clear understanding of its complexity is a must.",

They instantly put me on\u2026\u00a0 the white board and asked me to write some code.I politely asked him whether he even looked at my resume. He mentioned that he didn't look at it, and he rather want me to focus on writing code on the board. At that point, I was a bit ticked off. So, I told him that I didn't want to work for a company where people are treated as coders, and not humans. Then, I just walked out on him. The entire experience lasted for 5 minutes.When I emailed the HR person expressing my disappointment, she defended the interviewer by saying that they were interviewing a lot of people and that's why they didn't have time to chit-chat with the interviewees.",

        "details": "I had applied for a Leads Analyst and after a month, got a call saying they liked my resume and would want to consider me for another opening, as this particular post has been filled up. I said i would be willing to go ahead with that as my resume and skill set matched both profiles; exceeded in fact. Anyway, as I'm a fresher, i wanted to go for the\u2026\u00a0 Online Sales Operations Analyst post and was excited about the whole process.I had to take an Online test, which after submission was reviewed and i got a call back saying i should not have listed points in one of the answers, so i need to phrase it in a paragraph. My content and style was appreciated, but they needed to be sure. I took this test again and was announced of clearing it. This process itself took more than 2 weeks i suppose.Then, i was asked various things and briefed a little by the Recruiter, after which i was told i have two more rounds to go through. I waited patiently for the call on the mentioned date and time. I cleared it and then was informed to be going to the next round. The next call was scheduled after a week or so. I did not receive one and had to inform the Recruiter, who got back to me immediately. Cleared that round too. Then i was called again to say i have one more round to go through. I did, cleared it. Then one more. I really did not get the point of talking the same things time and again, but i obliged, probably getting better each time.Owing to the public holidays that do occur now and then, the Recruiter does not attend, say, 3 days before and after the holiday. EACH TIME. i have had to wait for ten days at a time to receive a mail from her saying that she is not at office. And then more waiting! Also, i do not receive confirmation mails of the Interview being scheduled or other info. I have to personally ask every time about an ascertainment.Oh and ya, one time there were 'Internal Problems' that they were dealing with, due to which they did not reply for weeks.All this done, with the last interview results pending, which i had done exceptionally well, i had the Recruiter disappearing once again. I finally received a reply to my mail saying she's yet again not in the office and she will be back in a week and let me know. Glory be!I waited for that fateful day and was waiting for a call, as i was so dead sure i would be selected. Instead, i receive a mail, saying that my interview has been impressive and so is my CV, but owing to the large volumes of interview conducted, i do not match the skill they are looking for. \"Unfortunately\", they would not be taking it forward, it seems. I was polite and asked them the reason as a personal inquisition and rectification if possible, but all i got was a reminding of the 'Company Policies' that they seem to follow to death and how they cannot divulge in more information. Seriously?I thanked them for the experience and the process. Whatever it was, the Recruiter was well mannered and helpful, compared to the other Recruiters out there.I did not take up 3 more jobs that came my way and did not apply anywhere else, thinking i suited the profile and also the interview went well. I know i was a fool in doing so, but heck, a major mistake; probably due to the confidence of my performance and my profile.I do not see the point in withholding the results and the information for such a long time or conducting so many rounds of interviews. As far as i can see it, it was not a stage wise interview or level clearing process. Because, i do not see myself getting evicted in the last round after talking the same things, that too in a better and more confident way after facing off so many rounds.The highlight was that i was told i would be asked questions about the industry and about the operations. I was asked NONE. Everything was about how and why things are so and so in life and plausible probability of some non existent situation. All that research and knowledge about FB and its functions went down the drain. Well, knowledge gained. . .",

Was informed that Facebook is seeking an Account Manager for Online Sales Operations in Singapore. Wanting to understand further (and passion for social media), I consented to a phone interview. The first phone interview was from an International Recruiter and the call was mainly to highlight the responsibilities of the job. Questions asked were mainly open-ended\u2026\u00a0 questions about myself and thoughts on the company.My second phone interview came a week after. The interviewer was a Sales Associate and her questions duly appraised my areas of expertise and suitability for the position. Questions this time around involved hypothetical scenarios (\"What will do to convince your client to invest in FB Ads\", \"How would you prioritize 50 clients?\").Was informed a week after with regards to my 3rd phone interview, this time from an Account Manager based in Texas. Her questions were mainly related to the position and consist of hypothetical and behavioral questions (\"What are your strengths/weaknesses\", \"How can you improve FB ads\", \"Say you are the account manager for XXX, how do you sell FB ads to them\"?.Received an email a couple of days later for an on-site interview with my potential colleagues. The office has quite a bit of communal space and the setup encourages interactions among colleagues - as expected from coming from FB. The session was split into three 1-on-1 interviews and aside from personal queries, some key questions asked were, \"Who are our competitors?\", \"How can we improve FB ads?\", \"Advantages of FB ads compared to our competitors\".Although I did not receive the offer, overall it was a positive and enriching experience.

I don't think she had any working experience in Asia to be expecting to hear what I said. Throughout the interview, she was generally not interested to hear anything apart from her 22-yards and she was extremely cold. This was the exact opposite of what I had experienced so far. Needless to say, by the time the call got over I had a feverish feeling that I won't be getting the job and that is exactly what happened.I hope FB takes in to account that while having a diverse set of peers interview you, they should appoint individuals with an open mind, rather than standoffish.",

One week after I took the writing assessment, my recruiter contacted me to schedule a 30-minute phone interview.Takeaway#1: For the writing assessment, be clear, concise, and manage your\u2026\u00a0 time effectively.My first phone interview, which was more of a screening call, was with a Facebook recruiter. The call lasted around 30 minutes and entailed a discussion of my resume. She was very thorough and asked very detailed questions about all aspects of my experience. I was surprised at the level of detail sought, considering she didn\u2019t work in the area for which I was applying. After the screening, she told me to expect a follow-up call from someone working in the department for which I applied.Takeaway#2: Be prepared to discuss your resume in detail and relate your experience to the Facebook job for which you are interviewing.The next day, a recruiting coordinator from the local Facebook office e-mailed me details for the next phone interview, which was with someone working in User Operations. This phone interview was more traditional and lasted around 30 minutes. I received an e-mail from my recruiter the next day inviting me to an on-site interview. I accepted.Takeaway#3: Know what Facebook is all about, express your excitement, and be prepared to articulate in detail what makes you a good fit for the position AND Facebook in general.The on-site recruiting coordinator contacted me to schedule the two-hour on-site interview. She also asked me to complete the Facebook employment application and nondisclosure agreement and bring both to the interview. Upon my arrival on-site, she took me to a very small room, with just enough room for three chairs, and asked me to wait for the first interviewer.The first interviewer arrived with her laptop in-hand, and proceeded to ask me standard interview questions, typing notes as I gave responses. The interview lasted 30 minutes. In fact, all subsequent interviews lasted 30 minutes.Takeaway#4: Be prepared to provide interesting stories about your most positive and negative work-related experiences, including lessons learned. Make sure you don\u2019t throw anyone under the bus!The second interviewer\u2019s questions were about personal and professional goals, why I was interested in Facebook, why I wanted to leave my job, etc.Takeaway#5: Be prepared to articulate the importance of life goals, why you\u2019re interested in Facebook, what you will offer Facebook in the first 90 days/five years, and what skills you will take away from working at Facebook.The third interviewer\u2019s questions focused on the position and asked philosophical questions about what role Facebook should play in ensuring safety on the site. He also asked for specific solutions to scaling User Operations support as the business continued to grow.Takeaway#6: Be prepared to offer suggestions for improving the Facebook user experience for both novices and experts.The final interviewer was older than the previous ones. The other interviewers were in their early 20s to very early 30s. I\u2019m sure he was a manager in that office. His questions focused on team dynamics. This entailed what kind of team I prefer, what role I fill in a team, what I think is destructive for a team, etc.Takeaway#7: Be prepared to reveal professional criticism you received from peers while working on a team, and explain how you dealt with the criticism.This was the end of my interviewing experience with Facebook. The recruiting coordinator told me I should receive word from my recruiter in about a week. A week later, I received an e-mail from my recruiter indicating I was not the right fit.Final Takeaway: If you didn\u2019t receive an offer, find something positive from the experience. It\u2019s only natural to feel the sting of rejection when losing out on this kind of opportunity, but rest assured that you wouldn\u2019t have made it that far in the interview process if you didn\u2019t have the right skills. They simply found a personality that would be a better fit for the team they\u2019re trying to build (or you were too old \u2013 kidding \u2013 sort of).My goal here is to share a more complete understanding of Facebook\u2019s interview process so others may spend less time trying to anticipate the process and more time thinking about why they are right for Facebook.I am more than happy to share other aspects of my interviewing experience with Facebook. Feel free to ask questions in the comments section below...I will respond there so everyone has the benefit to learn from my experience. Remember, it\u2019s anonymous\u2026Note: Some things I will not be able to comment on due to my NDA with Facebook.",

        "details": "Recruiter contacted me, reasonably quickly [within a week] after applying online and was generally very helpful.But the first interviewer started phone interview around 10 minutes late [in the end ending up kicked out of conf. room] and asked two very simple questions. One of the questions was given 2 arrays of size n and 2n containing n elements only, both sorted in ascending order, How will you merge, first array\u2026\u00a0 with second [which has size 2n] into second array in ascending order. I just used merge sort merge step and wrote java like psuedo code in collabedit.I tried out my code later and it worked fine with no changes [except that I used .length() instead of .length for array length]. But he didn't provide any feedback on what he was looking for. It was correct and complexity was the best possible. One thing I can think of later was I didn't add any method level comments [although I had comments in body] as it was pseudo code. Maybe he was looking for it [pure guess - as I don't know what he wanted]. I left with impression of having done the interview very well [I have worked in the best of companies and got interviewed and interview for those companies] and most of the time you know when you blew it.But I was surprised to get the rejection, 2 days later! Particularly given that question was too easy! Now I am left pondering over what was it? I consider interviews where the perception of interviewer and interviewee differs wildly in terms of performance as bad interviews with negative experience associated with it, as the interviewer didn't communicate his intention with the interviewee properly. If he was not looking for correctness and perf. [objectively defined as mentioned above], What was it?",

It was a technical interview, asking questions about data structures, algorithms, and runtime analysis. It wasn't hard. The questions were mostly about trees, hash tables, and a couple sort algorithms. She was nice at first when she asked me about my experience in\u2026\u00a0 the field (school projects and internship experiences) but she caught me off guard when asking the technical questions and I asked for a minute to think about the answer. Even though she said yes, a moment later she'd say \"Would you like me to move on to the next question?\" as if I didn't know the answer, but I did. So I'd try to explain to her what I thought at that moment and if I missed anything in my explanation, even the smallest thing, she'd cut me off to point that out and moved on to the next question. Fortunately, I did quite well. By the end of the week she emailed me that I'm through to the next round and that another recruiter would contact me with the details.After a few weeks, I didn't hear back from them so I emailed her. Apparently she had been snatched up from Facebook to a new startup company and left her files to other recruiters who didn't have time to go through all. It took me about a month (through the help of friends who also interviewed with Facebook and school's career services) to finally get ahold of a Facebook recruiter. She apologized and set me up with another interview right away. A software engineer called me a few days later and we used a website that let me code and he'd be able to see it. The second interview was just one coding problem (make sure you're fast and code bug-free programs!) and then we spent about 15-20 minutes talking about Facebook itself.

The questions they asked were typical text book puzzle programming tricks. The first engineer was not interested in exploring finding a correct answer to the problem, but instead had a particular best-performance trick in mind and wasn't really satisfied that the trick could not be discovered\u2026\u00a0 easily. The second engineer was far more collaborative and also seemed to be driving towards a best-performance answer, but he entertained possible solution ideas and was very collaborative in guiding towards the solution he was looking for.The first engineer was very animated and excited about his roles and positions at facebook, while the second was a bit more reserved but opened up when asked what he liked about the company and what he thought could be better. Both engineers were working on exciting highly scalable challenging products that would likely be a dream job for many software engineers, including myself.I loved the collaborative editing suite facebook uses to do the coding questions online and found it very helpful in sharing notes and coding solutions. Similar suites for other companies have low character limits and/or wonky execution.I received a prompt response after the second interview that Facebook will not be proceeding further, though I thought both interviews went well (aside from not knowing the the programming trick the interviewer had in mind).The recruiter or hiring manager also flagged my profile in facebook somehow so I receive a not-so-warm greeting at the top of every other job page I view on facebook saying \"Facebook will not consider you further\" more or less, which is a bit rude in my opinion. If an engineer does not fit for one group in the company that does not mean they will not fit at all.Like others, I received no feedback from the recruiter on why I was passed over, which is unfortunate because the more I learned about the company through interviewing, the more interested I became in giving Facebook a shot as a part of my career.",

This interview covered Linux, troubleshooting and some networking. This interviewer was very friendly and the interview itself went pretty well.For the second\u2026\u00a0 one they asked me to go to a document sharing web site and write a script. Unlike the previous one, this interviewer was not friendly at all, he seemed to be doing me a favor by wasting his time interviewing me and was completely quiet during the 30 minutes. I was stuck in one part of the problem and he didn't do anything to help me, like in other interviews I've gone through.I did a third interview which was similar to the first one but more focused on troubleshooting, although we also touched networking and the Linux boot process. Again, this interviewer was nice and friendly.After one week the recruiter came back to me to confirm what I suspected already, we would not proceed further because I didn't do well enough in the scripting part. I'm pretty sure that had the interviewer been more helpful I would have arrived at the solution. The recruited mentioned that I did very well on the other parts and that if I work on my scripting skills for a few months I could re-apply and take it from there.Because of this person I am rating the interview process as neutral and not positive, and will most likely not try again given the constant privacy concerns surrounding this company.The interviewing process is interesting and worth going through, though.",

The technical interview consisted of some more detail about the job and two scripting tests in a shared\u2026\u00a0 collaborative environment and one obscure problem to solve. The first script was to check some number of hosts for a daemon and send email about the hosts that did not have the daemon running. The second was to take a very large list of hosts and see if any were missing by comparing it to a reference list.

They were very focused on suggestions for improving Facebook product (almost every person I spoke with asked me this same question, by the end of the process I was exhausted to try to come up with new ideas every time I comfronted a different interviewer!!); they also wanted to know how to face the challenges they were encountering in EMEA region and ways to expand their user network in the country I had applied for.The interview seemed to go down really well and one member of the team even told me he was sure they'd see me around very soon which, TBH, made me believe the job was practically mine. When I thought the process had finally come to an end, I received another email from the recruiter scheduling AGAIN a final phone interview with Palo Alto. Eventually, after one month's waiting, I was phoned by the recruiter who told me that, though the team really liked me blablabla, they'd decided to go in for somebody else at the last moment.
