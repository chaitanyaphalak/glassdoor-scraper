**************************************Facebook University Analytics**************************************
This 8-week intern program is for college sophomores interested in data analytics. First there is an application and an essay due in February, and in March, a Facebook recruiter will contact you for an onsite interview if you're selected to move forward. You will meet and interact with other students who apply and make it as far as you.

**************************************Market Manager - Community Operations**************************************
Telephone screen followed by on site interview. 3, 30 minute interviews with different interviewers. Very structured and plenty of information in advance. Excellent feedback throughout the process from H.R. and although I didn't get the job, the process impressed me.

**************************************Accounts Payable Suuprt**************************************
I was shocked that they even hired me because it was the shortest interview I'd ever had. I told the agency that I didn't think they liked me since they spent so little time with me. Literally fifteen minutes with one person and then fifteen with another. The job that they told me I would be doing, was not at all what they asked of me.

**************************************Thermal Engineering**************************************
Phone interview after an email from HR. mostly technical questions! You need to be well prepared! The interviewer asked some technical questions about heat transfer, convection heat transfer coefficients, comparing heat transfer scenarios and different fluids, time constant, and etc. A short review of undergrad text books is not a bad idea.

**************************************Communications Manager**************************************
First, an HR person called me for an interview. It was standard HR questions such as1) why are you applying for this position?2)why do you want to leave your job?3) Why Facebook?4) describe your experiences5) What is your weakness?6) What is your Strength?Then I passed onto a Communications person in HQ. Her questions were also standard but specific on Facebook products.1) Why are you suitable for this position?2) What issues…  do you think Facebook will face in the near future?3) How would you deal with the issues?4) Compared to competitors (name them) - what are Facebook's weaknesses and strengths?The Comms person in HQ would often sound non commital and un interested. I had a feeling the entire time that she had "right answers" she was looking for and I wasn't giving it.She also has no experience in Asia - so I'm not sure she fully understood the Asian market to be interviewing a person for this position. I wish it had been someone based here who interviewed me.There you have it. I didn't hear back from them at all.Make sure to read up on latest FB issues, products, troubles, etc. Good luck.

**************************************SMB Marketing Manager**************************************
Three case studies. Ask about metrics, analytics. interviewed with director. They are looking to grow the smb team and increase as they get into 2016. Talked to HR and gave my elevator pitch. She emailed me back and said she wants me to talk to the director.

**************************************Oracle Applications Developer**************************************
There was a phone screening with the recruiter, Then I was scheduled for a 1st screening in person. The Interviewer didn't even know that he was interviewing me for a developer position. He was under the impression that he was interviewing for application support role. and the interview was more about writing standard oracle quires. On the Feedback also recruiter mentions that I was not being considered for application support…  role. Not sure how they can shift from evaluating a person from one role to other without even informing me. It was very bad experience for me for the size of the company.

**************************************Software Development Intern**************************************
Dropped my resume at the college career fair, got called back, had two on-campus interviews (if you pass the first one, you get called back for the next one). Got an offer pretty soon.

**************************************Global Security Specialist**************************************
Applied online and 2 weeks later, got an email from the recruiter asking to schedule a phone interview. Phone interview lasted exactly half an hour. Recruiter was super nice and friendly and chill. Questions were pretty routine- Why Facebook? Describe a time when you took ownership of a project. Waited one week and didn't hear anything so I emailed the recruiter to ask. She replied back a few hours later…  saying the hiring manager decided to go with other candidates.

**************************************Designer**************************************
Job fair at my school, i went over to the facebook desk and ask few questions to the lady and then they ask if i will like a interview for a graphic design job, i said yes.

I applied for a designer position and the process started with a typical phone screening interview with human resources and then a member of the team I'd be working with. Then they brought me in to meet with a few different people on the team for a day. They all asked different types of questions, some were more about the company itself, others were real scenario-based questions, how I would…  solve certain problems and a lot were about what I could offer. Be prepared.

**************************************Marketing Intern**************************************
Two phone interviews and then an onsite 3 hour interview with three different people from the sales and marketing division in NYC. Very fit oriented. Asked about why I wanted to work at FB, what previous sales and marketing experience I had, where I thought FB was going in 10 years.

**************************************Front End Engineer**************************************
This process consisted of an initial Skype chat (with a couple of technical questions at the end), then two technical screening Skype / CoderPad interviews, then an on-site interview. The on-site interview itself consisted of one behavioural interview, then two technical coding interviews, then one design / architecture interview. I was guided through the process by recruiters and a co-ordinator.

I applied through a recruiter who contacted me in September. She was nice and we booked a Phone/Screen coding interview.They are using CoderPad for these. This first interview consisted of 3 questions, they all seemed pretty easy and then the interviewer asked for edge cases, a bit more challenging but nothing impossible. The interviewer was really nice and encouraging.After that, I had another Phone/Screen interview which was basically the same.…  There was a basic question which was to code an observer pattern. It wasn't too hard but much more challenging than the first one, especially when the interviewer ask about some edge cases. Again the interviewer was really nice and encouraging and giving you clues when he saw I was blocked.I finally got to the last step, the onsite interview, and it was a bit different in my opinion. First, the process took a lot of time, I had a chat with a recruiter but I didn't know if I would have the interview in London or in Menlo Park. It took almost a month before I had the interview organised. I finally flew from London to Menlo Park for the onsite interview, the organisation was pretty easy though, everything is arranged by Facebook, I flew 2 days before the interview and returned the evening after the interview.The onsite interview consisted of 4x45 min interview, 2 coding interviews on a whiteboard, 1 conversation interview and 1 architecture interview. I felt like one of the coding interview was much harder than any other interview I had with Facebook and it was also much harder to get things right on a whiteboard, and I was absolutely terrible at this one. The other coding interview was more like the phone/screen interview, not too hard but a bit more challenging when I got to the edge cases, it made me wonder if I've just been very unlucky for the first coding interviews that I had a much harder one, but well that's part of the game. I can see that people were asked to code the array flatten in a iterative and recursive way for the first phone/screen interview, but I did it in a recursive way only, so I guess I got lucky in other interviews.In those interviews you will be mostly asked algorithms questions: iterative and recursive patterns, complexity (big O notation) and data structures. Don't hesitate to ask questions and to talk about the problem before even starting to code, that's very important especially that on a white board it's much harder to amend code (you can't copy paste or add line breaks everywhere), it's very important to know what you're going to do before writing anything, rather than writing as you think, like I did. Also the interviewers were very nice and encouraging even though I was terrible, they kept giving me clues and ways to think. I also was super stressed and slept around 3h the night before because of the jetlag, which didn't help.Besides those coding interviews that were the challenging part for me, the conversation interview was more about getting to know me and classic interview questions (Why Facebook? Why Front End? Tell about a project you had and how you solved it? Tell about a conflict you had at work and how you dealt with it?), for this one the recruiter told me about all these questions before so I had everything prepared.The architecture interview was more about how you would approach a front end problem and how you would structure your code, whether it's about HTML, CSS or Javascript. This one didn't seem to be too hard, if you have enough experience with layouts and front end issues, it shouldn't be fine.After that one, I came back to London in the evening, a recruiter called me on Skype 2 days later and told me the team didn't want to go forward. I was kind of expecting it since I haven't been good in the coding interviews, still I was very disappointed and frustrated that I went all the way to Menlo Park, visited the Facebook HQ and that I eventually failed... But still the recruiter was very nice and keen to give me any feedback, I was just so disappointed that I didn't ask anything.In the end I'd say it was a very positive experience, all the people I've been in touch with were very kind and encouraging, the interviews seemed reasonable and looked like things I should be able to solve if I was a top coder. I have to wait more than 1 year to try again and I might do it, I hope I can have the onsite interview in London this time.

1 HR Phone Call followed by a Video Call interview. The interview process was very pleasant and I can't say enough about how amazing the recruiter was that helped me through the process. I feel like I needed to brush up more on Javascript fundamentals, best practices with CSS, and being more careful with iteration and recursion concepts.

I've interviewed with lots of big companies and overall have had mostly terrible experiences. Facebook was different, in a very good way. You can tell that a lot of thought and care have gone into their recruiting process.I saw that they were hiring for front end engineers in Seattle, so I applied on a whim and sort of forgot about it after a while. A couple months later, a recruiter…  reached out to me and we had an initial phone conversation. This was a very initial screen that was mostly non-technical with the exception of some quick and simple JavaScript pop-quiz questions at the end (== vs ===, describe event delegation, etc).Next step was a technical phone screen. This was pretty fast-paced as the interviewer was trying to squeeze in as much as possible in a short amount of time while leaving time at the end to field my questions. He did a very good job at keeping things moving and on track, asking me some general questions about my background and then some simple coding exercises to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS, and consequences of going with different design choices. Then a simple JavaScript tree problem.Next were the in person interviews. This is the part I thought they did exceptionally well compared with other companies. The whole process was extremely transparent and I was given lots of information and resources ahead of time so that I knew what to expect. It consisted of 2 coding (ninja) interviews, a design (pirate) interview, and a behavioral (jedi) interview, all about 45 minutes each. Between interviews a lunch was scheduled with another engineer, who is not part of the feedback loop, giving me plenty of opportunities to ask my questions about company and culture, as well as get a tour of the office.Overall, the questions seemed very relevant to the position. The interviewers were also super friendly and helpful along the way, and seemed to genuinely want you to succeed. No over-bearing egos set out to prove how much smarter than you they were, or trying to trip you up with trick questions or irrelevant questions (I've been asked physics questions before for front-end roles, sigh).Great experience.

The process was both smooth and quick. I applied by referral, and had a phone interview within a couple weeks. After that went well, I went on to an onsite. The onsite was just 4 parts, plus lunch. The coding challenges were both fun and relevant to me as a front end engineer. And the people were really friendly and welcoming. I even felt like the interview could have been…  longer without it being a problem.

Initial HR screen which included some basic front end questions: .call vs .apply,Followup with a phone call + online coding screening with questions bellow. 40 minutes long followed by 20 minutes of questions. Interviewer was very enthusiastic and very welcoming, didn't feel any kind of negativity. Flopped on the easy questions so knew that I wasn't getting the on-site invite but interviewer was still very happy to answer company related…  questions and go into detail.

The interviewer called me on my Skype. We used an interactive coding website. First part was about my resume (3-4 minutes), then the coding part (40 minutes), then questions from me to the recruiter (3-4 minutes).

Initial Chat - 3 basic JS questions ---> difference between == and === , difference between block and inline and I forgot the thirdCalendar challenge (as the others have said there's a challenge). I too think this was the most difficult.Then on-site. I heard a lot of good things about their interview process on-site, but I felt like mine wasn't that great. I had 3 interviews back-to-back without breaks. I…  didn't get a tour or a meal...I also received no feedback, just that my whiteboard code wasn't clean (Um you should be quick, if you fail 1 interview you fail .. period). My recruiter was great. You can tell she tried. They called me a few days later telling me I didn't meet the requirements.BIGGEST TIP: Go through all the questions on Glassdoor and CareerCup, code on paper not on your laptop! Trust your code will come out cleaner on a whiteboard this way.

Gave resume to recruiter on campus, was set aside for a Front End position given experiences on resume. Contacted later by the Front End recruiter. Did a mostly behavioral phone interview, a coding challenge, another phone interview, then on-sites.

The process was very quick and efficient, and took about 4 weeks, as far as I remember.The recruiter (Facebook's own employee) was very good, kept me updated on the process throughout the different interviews etc. The same for the phone interviews, they really know their stuff.The on-site interviewers were friendly, engaged in the interviews (except one, she was working on her laptop during the session) and they want you to…  succeed, it definitely feels like they are on your side.The entire interview process was a very positive experience. I might apply again another time.

Recruiter reached out after applying online. A coding challenge, followed by a screen, and then on on site all day. All questions asked were totally reasonable and focused on my background/experience. No "why are man holes round questions". My interviewers were great at asking questions and holding an engaging conversation.

Process began via a phone call from a recruiter. Recruiter took down a few biographic details including education and work history, and then promised a follow-up soon. I was sent a coding puzzle, which I completed in a couple days and sent back. A few days later, I confirmed a phone interview via email.A week after the phone interview, the recruiter called back and told me they'd like to bring…  me on site for one of their "university days" which included a bunch (it varies - I had 3) back-to-back interviews, each about 45 minutes long, followed by lunch, and a tour.About a week after that, I was told of my final result via email. It's possible the recruitment team could have worked faster; I just decided to play it slow and make more deliberate moves.

Started with an internal HR phone screen after I submitted my cv on Facebook's career website. Then typical 2 tech phone screens before I was taken to the Facebook HQ. Interviewers and HRs were all very nice, smart and passionate. I felt I had done not too bad on the on-site interview, even though I did need quite help from the interviewers and the code on the whiteboard was definitely…  not beautiful. The feedback turned out that I wasn't so good to get into the UI/UX team. One week after the on-site interview, I was arranged for another interview over the phone with a different team, but it's totally not my area, so it's not surprising it got busted. Generally very good experience, very nice and helpful HR people and excited to be able to visit Facebook campus.

First phone screening included couple of Javascript Questions about functions you can perform on strings. Also CSS related questions like difference between block and inline. Followed by a kind of homework to build a layout for a calendar where events added on the calendar that collide in time can't visually collide but should take same width with the events that they collide in time with.After that another 45 minutes interview…  that was a chat on my previous projects and why I wanted to work for facebook plus 2 Javascript question on Collabedit.

A recruiter emailed me then scheduled a brief preliminary phone call. They asked about my experience and why I'd be interested in working at Facebook and explained the recruitment process.The next day I was sent a front-end coding puzzle/challenge to complete, which took about 10 hours. Given a set of boxes with fixed vertical dimensions I had to implement a JavaScript algorithm that lays them out according to some specifications.A…  phone interview was scheduled about a week after completing the puzzle. I spoke with a front-end engineer and coded through a few HTML/CSS/JS questions using a shared document. My thought process was emphasized more than getting syntactically-correct answers, as long as I could explain what I was trying to do.The next day I was told I would move on to the next phase and was flown to California about 2 weeks later. The in-person interview consisted of 4 45-minute interviews, each of which were similar to the phone interview. We talked a bit about why I would like to work at Facebook and wrote code on a whiteboard. I was asked to write how I would implement visual UI features, array search/mutation algorithms, and JS performance functions.Throughout the process the recruiters were quick to reply to my emails and open to any questions I had. However after I was told I didn't get an offer they stopped being that helpful and couldn't offer me a way to obtain feedback about my interviews.

I applied for another position two months prior to being contacted about another position the recruiter felt I was more suited. The phone interview was typical recruiter conversation (CV, languages, types of projects, why I wanted to work at Facebook). I was then asked to complete a code exercise in JS or PHP. It involved sorting and arranging overlapping events on a day calendar like iCal. While I easily complete…  the exercise and accommodated for all stated and unstated event scenarios, I was told that Facebook was no longer interested after reviewing my code. I was quite surprised and requested additional feedback, but they did not provide it. I gave them several hours of my time to complete their test. The least they could have done was give me 10 more minutes of theirs.

Interviewed me on campus as part of coop process. They had a general meet and greet for all candidates the day before the interviews. They said there were to be two interviews, the second being a callback to the candidates they are interested in after the first interview. Since I interviewed for front-end they asked JavaScript specific questions

I had a first round phone screening with a technical recruiter. Asked about goals and past experience in software development. After that, he gave me a take home assignment to complete. It was to build a puzzle game using Javascript. You have a week to complete the assignment and email it back to them.

A recruiter approached me through email. I had a quick online interview with typical HR questions (experience, why would you like to join, etc) and 4 very simple technical questions. The interviewer was very polite and explained the entire process. Afterwards, I received a coding challenge via email and was given 3 weeks to complete it. The interviewer garanteed I could take my time. I completed it in something like…  10 hours over the span of 1 week and a half (busy week at work) and delivered the results pretty confident that I wrote clean code, with tooling, comments and even specs. After that, in half a day I received a single "no" with zero feedback. I suspect they are not measuring your ability to solve the problem, but something else, as it was pretty much solved perfectly... Anyways, I was saddened by the lack of feedback - as others pointed out, if we gave them hours of time, they could at least point what was missing.

Applied for new grad front end engineer position through University of Waterloo's job posting system. Was contacted by recruiter via e-mail on a Friday, interview schedule for Wednesday of following week. Meet and greet, informal reception occurred on Tuesday evening before interview. Very friendly interviewer and employees at reception. 45 minute interview consisted of questions regarding work experience and projects, followed by 2 technical questions.

I applied directly to a recruiter. First, I had a 15-minutes phone conversation about this offer, preferred location, my skills etc. Two weeks later I had a skype technical interview. I had to describe my previous jobs, hardest challenges etc. Later I was given two small tasks to code using online editor. The engineer was very helpful and was trying to point me to the solution.

**************************************Product Lead**************************************
Got a specialist talent Facebook recruiter call me and set up interview for position of Product Lead for couple of their new acquisitions. First had interview with the recruiter for an hour. Went through tech & design related questions including (which I thought was nice) failures on new products that I had worked on etc. It was really indepth. Followed by interview by the CTO who has now left.

**************************************User Operations Associate**************************************
3 rounds of interview. The HR person will let you know some of the questions in advance so that you can be well prepared. You will talk to HR first. A member from the team in the 2nd round. You will meet your future boss in the 3rd round and 2 other team members as well.

**************************************Devops Engineer**************************************
Did a coding challenge with them over the phone and the interviewer cut me off before I could finish but did not mention there was a time limit.

**************************************Quality Specialist Community Operations**************************************
I got 2 phone interviews, the first one with HR and the second one with a quality specialist, it was good the interview with HR and the interview with the specialist, at the end I just received an e-mail saying thank you for your time but we will not continue with your application.

**************************************Data Engineer Manager**************************************
The initial and second interview went good. The 3rd one for technical interview, I got the confirmation from HR that Manager won't require coding test. i though they only ask SQL however on top of SQL they ask me on Coding which I didn't expect nor repair for it.However, I like the whole process and wish that I better prepare for coding because I haven't code for 7 years.

**************************************Offsite Technical Producer**************************************
Starting out with a brief phone interview with a recruiter, I was moved on to a second video call with the head of the area I was applying to work in. The questions were a mix of simple technical questions, generic interview personality questions, and a few hypotheticals. Everyone was very friendly and made me feel at ease.

**************************************Training**************************************
The interview process lasted 10 weeks and included a number of phone and skype interviews along with a round of face to face onsite interviews. The biggest challenge was coordination, there seemed to be a lack of organization and recruiter had little attention to detail.

**************************************Human Resources**************************************
Phone screen w/recruiter- lasted over 30 mins. She asked very clear and poingnant questions that I had to really think twice about. Very focused questions, clearly w/pre-thought around pre-screening. Good start, always good to see they are stringent in how they hire people.My answer to "what will your current employer do to retain you" probably did not convince her. Got an email a week later I was not in the…  running.

Interviewed with 4 individuals. Interview process very disorganized. Recruiter could not find a conference room. One interviewer didn't make it in to work that day, so we interviewed over by phone. There was general confusion as to what the essential responsibilities of the actual role were going to be and the reporting structure. The last interview, with the attorney, argued that the position wasn't really needed and he didn't know…  what HR was thinking.The final meeting (with the attorney upstairs), was in an office akin to a 60's love nest--stereo, bar, cushions on the floor.I left thinking their recruiting and interviewing proccess could sure use some refinement.

I submitted my resume to facebook through the careers page on their site. About a week later, I received a call from an internal recruiter. The initial phone interview lasted between 20-30 minutes. A few days later, I was contacted to set up an in-person interview. I met with three people for about 30 minutes each.The next day, I received an email letting me know that I was out of…  the running.

My interview process was short. It consisted of two separate 30 minute phone interviews with a recruiter and then the hiring manager. The interview with the recruiter was standard other than the fact that the interviewer was switched at the last moment and so the recruiter had not even seen my resume. I was a little surprised at the lack of rigor but I suspect they are very busy. The…  second interview was a couple of days later with the hiring manager who turned out to be extremely rigorous and took careful note to dissect my skills and probe my weaknesses. I was caught off guard due to my experience with the recruiter, so please be sure to not let this happen to you.

Was approached by a recruiter for the role. Set up a time to discuss about it. Quite disappointed with the call as she was not able to explain the role clearly. When probed about the structure of the team, she replied that she was just helping out a colleague, so has not idea about the team.She was friendly, but other than that I can't imagine being part of a HR…  team that wasn't prepare and seems nonchalant. I declined to be consider further for the role.

**************************************Market Specialist, Community Operations, Dublin**************************************
They send you a link to a test to be completed in 90 min, mathematical/logical reasoning questions and a brief dissertation. Next step was an awful phone interview, took me some time to understand why was so awful. 1) The interviewer was a pushy person and I felt bullied, not interviewed, I believe a good HR professional is able to collect the information that needs without you even realize what…  happened, that's why sometimes you think you went well but actually you didn't, not this case though, I felt the pain to know his/her feelings all way thru it. The lowest point was when the recruiter used irony/sarcasm. At the end of the interview the recruiter told me that would talk with his/her manager and would contact me afterwords, there was an email in my Inbox in less than 10 min. I write this with sadness as I am no longer flooding with anger, I believe this recruiter believes himself/herself very competent and eager to deliver the best candidate no doubt, but behave like that and leave such a bad impression..., and surprise!!!, I told a friend that I had a terrible interview at Facebook and before I could end the sentence this friend told me "Oh..you got xxx!!!..terrible not?!!!" Anyway, I don't believe this person is aware of what is doing and neither stands for what Facebook is about, if you cross someone that sounds like that leave your review here, on day someone will look into this.

**************************************Technical Recruiter**************************************
I wish there had been one. I was referred internally and got a message shortly after requesting times to speak. I followed up with an email and 3 days later another with updated times after hearing nothing. 4 days following that I received an apology email for an over cluttered inbox and another request for times to speak. AGAIN, I sent an email with new times and have heard nothing…  since. Bummer-

My resume was submitted through a referral. So got a first call for basic screening and then she said the recruiter will call you. She seemed to be very new to industry and very immature. She asked me 3-4 questions. She said after that I am not suitable for the job. I have received at least 5-6 inmails after that from different recruiters from facebook that my profile looks perfect…  for the position and if I have time to speak to them.

I was approached on Linkedin and a phone interview was scheduled with a recruiter. It was the worst phone interview experience I have ever had. While many companies have open office environments, I felt like the interviewer was standing in a crowded bar in the middle of "Happy Hour". It was very difficult to even hear the questions and then when you answered you could hear a tremendous amount of…  background noise and it was difficult to think.I wasn't updated by the recruiter or the scheduler

Took 3 weeks total. The interview process was pretty good once I was connected through an internal recruiter. The phone interview was challenging which helped as an indicator for the onsite interview (also fairly challenging). The onsite consisted of 4 back-to-back 1 on 1s.

Lunch with Recruiting Manager, interviewed with 2 recruiters and 2 sourcers. Received offer from recruiting manager. Interviewers did not seem prepared. The questions they asked weren't very challenging or deep. They also didn't seem excited about working there.

Had a phone call, very straight forward questions, asked all the right questions to understand my knowledge, very quickly sent me to talk to manager,very kind , very understanding with the accent issues. had a good time

1st Round Telephone Screen (1 interviewer 40mins). 2nd Round Face to Face (4 interviewers X 30mins each). The recruiter who contacted me was excellent. Kept me up to date during the entire process and was only a phone call or email away when I had any questions. The phone interview was on my motivations and what I knew about Facebook as well as where I see my career going. The…  face to face interview covered working in teams, sourcing techniques, working with hiring managers, engaging with candidates during the recruitment journey and questions about how I operate on pressure. During the interview I was nervous as it is Facebook but the interviewers made me feel relaxed. They of course want to find the right candidate and they create a very calm atmosphere during the interview to make sure they get the best out of any candidates interviewing. Overall I couldn't fault the recruitment process. It is everything and more of what I thought it would be. The team in there are absolutely brilliant. If you have the chance to interview try and enjoy it. It truly is an experience and something as a recruiter that I am proud to say I have done. I certainly will be taking parts away with me to incorporate into my own candidates journey. One team, One dream!

**************************************Network Manager**************************************
Email sent to my account which is associated with my FB account and almost missed it. Phone interview was scheduled shortly deoending on the availability of hiring manager. Got an interviewer who went straught into the grit of the job and my tech capabilities and handling of employees.

**************************************User Operations Spanish**************************************
What would do with a Facebook user who was having trouble with their account?

**************************************Diversity Role**************************************
Spoke with a recruiter on the phone and a peer before being flown to San Fran to meet with team. The recruiter was not informed about the role or the department, she literally read the job description word for word. I met with the hiring manager first in the first 15 mins she told me they were going to promote the peer to role. I continued the interviews with other…  interviewers. So essentially they flew me out there for nothing. It was nice to meet the group but could saved me the time and told me over the phone.

**************************************Brand and Consumer Marketing Internship**************************************
I got an email from facebook to schedule a phone interview with the consumer marketing team. The first scheduled interview was cancelled last minutes, and got pushed back 3 times. When I finally had my interview, the interviewer was 20 minutes late calling me. I had to email the recruiter so she can remind the interviewer. The interviewer didn't really ask me and question but only asked me what I…  can do for the time. 15 minutes later she said she had to go to another meeting, and if I have anymore questions I can ask HR. I got a rejection letter 1 week after.

**************************************Technology Partner**************************************
Was contacted by a recruiter for an Internal Tools Engineer position. During initial phone screen, the possibility of applying instead for the Technology Partner role was presented (based on my diverse background as a founder/PM and application developer). After thinking it through for a couple of days, I opted to proceed with the Technology Partner interview.My first phone interview (45 min.) was with the hiring manager. I was asked a…  broad range of questions, from the expected ("Why Facebook?") to the very specific (questions about using data to inform product decisions at my prior companies). There were a handful of process questions--fairly standard product management type stuff.After the initial phone interview, I was contacted by the recruiter to setup a phone interview with the hiring manager's boss. This interview was similar in format to the prior phone interview, and the same types of questions were asked. I could sense that they were looking for specific data points on prior product decisions, so having a handful of "for instance" answers proved very helpful. At the end of this call, I was told that the recruiter would be arranging my travel details for an on-site interview.The onsite interview process was fairly straightforward. Facebook is awesome about scheduling travel for out of town applicants, and the arrangements were made without a hitch. The on-site interview consisted of six 45min. interviews as well as lunch with the recruiter.While I can't provide specific questions, make sure you brush up on your SQL! For this position, there was one basic engineering interview (which I found to be very enjoyable, having to do with the style of the particular engineering manager, and the types of questions asked). In addition to the engineer, I interviewed with two Technology Partners, the hiring manager, the hiring manager's boss, and an analyst.I was very comfortable with the questions asked, other than a brief stumble on a SQL question. I enjoyed the personalities of everyone I interviewed with, and everyone was punctual and very reassuring.I emailed the recruiter a week after the onsite interview, and was promptly phoned. They opted to pass on making an offer. The recruiter was very gracious, and indicated that all the feedback from the interviewing group was positive, and they'd like to keep me in consideration for other positions in the future.

I was contacted by a Facebook Recruiter to discuss this position. I have over 12 years of experience while the position expected someone with just 4+ years of experience. This made me wonder if it was too junior a position for me. But the recruiter explained that at Facebook most employees with 4+ years of experience are expected to be able to do this job. It's not that the position…  is of a junior level; it's just the caliber of people expected at Facebook. This, both, impressed and intimidated me.After the initial chat with the recruiter, I had a 45-minute interview with the Hiring Manager. Although he was poker-faced throughout the interview, he was warm and never made me feel uncomfortable. He went to great lengths to explain the role, it's position within the company and the culture of FB. I came away wanting to work there even more!When I didn't hear back from the recruiter for about 2 days after the interview (I'm impatient!), I emailed her requesting a feedback. She immediately called me back and said that they were working on trying to bring me back for more detailed interviews with the team. And within a couple of days they scheduled another on-site for me. This time I was to be interviewed by the Hiring Manager again, his boss and 3 of his direct reports who would be peers of the position that I was interviewing for. The interview would last for almost 4 hrs of 45minutes with each interviewer.I was surprised to be interviewed by the Hiring Manager again but I soon realized that my initial chat with him had been just that - an informal chat. This time around he grilled me in detail about the various projects I had managed in the past. He made me draw a process flow of the Business area that I would be supporting and asked detailed questions of every aspect; he didn't miss a thing. The same pattern followed with the other interviewers too. They came prepared with specific questions about my work experience and as I answered them I realized that they were able to extract from me all the information they needed to learn about my working history and experience in a very precise manner.Looking back at the interview, those 4hrs at Facebook were quite grueling and taxing for my mind because I hadn't had such an intense interview in years. I had never had to draw process flows or explain SQL statements or present a graphic outline of the various systems within my business area before. However, I now realize that they probably have a very good idea of what I know and especially, what I don't know. Throughout the interviews all of them said the same thing to me - do not worry; there is no right answer; it's okay if you don't know.As for me, I learnt a lot about the culture at Facebook and what this position would require of me if they offered me the position. I learnt that they expect things to move along at a fairly quick pace without any bureaucratic culture. They don't expect you to succeed in every venture you take up and would never punish you for occasional failures that are bound to happen. They just want enthusiastic, intelligent and passionate people to work with.Each and every interviewer at Facebook came across as super-smart and passionate about their jobs. 3 out of the 5 told me that they cannot imagine working anywhere else now. I came away knowing that not only will this be a challenging place to work but it will also be an opportunity to work with some really smart people who completely enjoy what they are doing.I haven't received any feedback from FB yet but no matter which way this goes, I feel super happy about having had the opportunity to interview there and get a glimpse of its working.

Disclaimer: One of the interviewers was my internal reference as well. All titles are paraphrased/alternatives1. Initial discussion with hiring manager to gauge level of interest on both sides2. Recruiter Phone Screen3. Peer Technical Phone Screen (because position applied for was different from position interviewed)4. On-site interviews4.1 Recruiter intro/level-set4.2 Divisional Head interview4.3 Lunch interview with hiring manager4.4 Sub-divisional Head interview 14.5 Sub-divisional Head interview 24.6 C-level interview (no, not Zuckerberg, but…  close enough :-) )4.7 Hiring Manager interview #2 (because lunch was truncated for other reasons)Almost 4 weeks to the dot for response. Feedback was very positive, but not a clear fit for position (I agree too).I have over 15 years of experience working for about 10 different companies, but this interview experience will stand out in memory for a long, long time. Not a single dud interview. Each interviewer was unmistakably intelligent. Interview topics were completely free-flowing - one interview was mostly a debate on the Civil War :-) Interviewing styles were markedly different, but each interviewer knew exactly what they were looking for and most were able to get the information they wanted by making you talk about what you've done in the past, rather than just ask academic questions.Technical questions were easy, but this was for a position in Ops, so clearly not as technical as engineering interviews. Jargon in resume was deeply challenged by some interviewers. Everyone was very respectful, friendly, open, and most importantly, seemed interested in what I had to say (some were open to broad discussions, others wanted more concise answers).Only suggestion to candidates would be, shed all facades and appearances and go as yourself. I had so much fun that I wanted to interview some more! I can see how some might find the interviews daunting and the interviewers intimidating, but if you're comfortable with who you are, you'll meet some very interesting people who are deeply, deeply passionate and have an integrated outlook toward work, life and fun.Negatives: They're going through some logistical challenges in the new offices, though hardly anything out of the ordinary. Depending on who you interview with, the recruiting team may find it hard to assimilate feedback in a timely manner. Somewhat cultish adherence to principles/ideology/Zuck - practically each interviewer apologized for sounding like they'd drunk the kool-aid :) They don't yet realize that they're getting too busy for their actions to always match their words. I'm sure so far they've meant everything they said, but as they get bigger and busier, they should be a little cautious about setting expectations, particularly w.r.t time and responsiveness.Bottom-line: Truly passionate, honest, intelligent, focused workforce, but individual personalities seemed subservient to the spirit of the company. They'll get the cream of the crop, but easy to understand why some exceptionally individualistic people may turn them down without second thought.

**************************************Ads Risk Associate**************************************
Applied online without any contacts inside FB, contacted 4 weeks later via email by a recruiter to set up a phone interview/screening. Call lasted 30 minutes, basic behavioral questions. Contacted 2 weeks later by recruiter to set up follow-up interview with someone on Risk team.Within the week had phone interview with head of Risk Credits team. As others have noted, you can tell you're on speaker and throughout the interview…  you can hear others who are mumbling things about what you're saying and what to ask you next. Started with basic walk through of resume and a few situational questions about past experiences, then ended with risk-specific questions. One of the questions was about putting yourself in the "bad guy's" position and explaining how you commit online fraud.Overall interview was a decent experience, I prepared too much for typical behavioral questions and not enough for risk-specific questions. I botched one of the questions and the girl's tone of voice changed drastically and I didn't need the email in a week to realize I wasn't getting invited for an on-site interview-just a lack of professionalism. I'm sure it is a wonderful place to work though.

**************************************Network Engineering Manager**************************************
Applied online months ago. Received an email to my Facebook login account which I usually don't monitor and went to my junk box. A week later, received another e-mail from the recruiter who promptly scheduled me a phone screen with him. Phone screen with typical questions to validate me and to make sure I knew the position. The following week, scheduled interview with hiring manager.

**************************************Critical Facilities Engineer**************************************
I made it to the phone interview and that was it. Mostly by my choice. The interview contained the usual questions. Why Facebook? How can we benifiet from your experiance? I ultimatly decided not to continue the process because salary came up and it was clear that they were not going to be able to offer what I wanted.

**************************************Online Operations**************************************
Submitted my resume on a Monday and got an email back the following week by the recruiter. The recruiter screened me and asked me to do a phone interview with a senior member on the team. Two days afterwards, I conducted the phone interview and asked typical questions of "why facebook?" "what challenges do you face during your day-to-day?" "who do you interface with on a daily basis?" All and…  all, I think the phone interview went okay. After about 4-5 days, I was invited to come on-site for an interview, which I still have yet to do.

**************************************Financial Analyst**************************************
I applied online and the process took about 3 weeks. I've also interviewed onsite for the final round with 5 people. I've interviewed with the two manager, two directors, and an analyst. They've asked mostly behavioral questions about my experience and why I wanted the role. Nothing too difficult. Then you have a timed excel test which asks basic questions however the analyst who gave the test questioned me while…  I was taking the test which counted against my time. I had an overall pleasant experience with the interview process but felt very disrespected while taking the excel test.

first in interview there wil be personality test ,then there will be group panel interviw..after that there will be 1:! and then skills test will be taken then after that intelliegence test adn background check also will be looked at .

**************************************Advertising Operations Associate**************************************
The HR contacted me and indicated that this position was a better match to my expertise. They then passed me the information for this role and asked if I was interested in it. After that, they arranged for me to have a phone interview with the hiring manager who was stationed in Dublin. The manager was friendly and asked rather typical interview questions such as "Tell me a little about…  yourself".

**************************************Data Analyst Intern**************************************
This was not an on campus recruiting, and I just submitted my resume from our campus career website then got the email for a first-round phone interview after one month. I was mostly asked about behavior questions like what 's my favorite course in school, how I motivate other people,etc. The recruiter is nice, but very smart and straightforward. She asked many follow-up questions after I answered the questions.

**************************************Junior Software Engineer**************************************
-HR person got in touch with me the day after I applied and scheduled a technical phone interview-45 minute phone interview where I had to code using CollabEdit-Talked about one of my projects in school first, then 1 coding question: Given a matrix, write an algorithm where if an element in the matrix is 0, turns all the elements in that row and column into zeros-Thought it went pretty well,…  I solved the question (although I think I took too long) and the interviewer was very nice and put me at ease but I didn't get an offer. I will try again though :)

Interview process was very straightforward and fast. They rescheduled to meet my needs. The interviewer was helpful. The follow up was good and requested to check with them after a few months.

**************************************Strategic Partner Manager**************************************
A phone call with the recruiter then a second one with the hiring manager.The hiring manager was very disrespectful of my time. He only asked me one behavioral question and said that's all from him then asked me to ask him questions, to which he gave very short answers. It's clear maybe he has already found someone he liked but I wish he would've just canceled my phone screen. I…  studied all week for the interview only to get evaluated based on one irrelevant question.

**************************************Applications Engineer Internship**************************************
I had first telephonic round today. I was not able to give efficient solution and the code which I wrote was sloppy.Call went for standard, 45 minutes.Following is the question:Given a list of ranges, find whether the target range is in the union of the given intervals.e.g: Input: a list of intervals, e.g. [-10, 10], [50, 100], [0, 20]                 & a target range    Output: true if target can be covered by the…  union of all intervals       e.g. return true if target is [-5, 15]             return false if target is [30,60]counter-example: target is [0,100], intervals are [50,60],[20,30],[60,80],[0,20],[80,100],[30,50]

**************************************Research Analyst**************************************
A couple phone interview and F2F interview

**************************************Infrastructure MBA**************************************
There were three Interviews. The first one was an HR Interview followed by an interview with the Director and then an interview with the manager. All Interviews were 30 -- 45 minutes in duration. The interviews were pointed more towards assessing ease of working with and fast thinking.The Results were out fast.

**************************************Summer Technology**************************************
Selected by on campus Facebook drive for a 45 minute Technical interview round. Pre orientation was held at New York office. Easy going people, fun to be with. Same interview question was asked to every candidate by the same interviewer.Focus was on algorithm and data structure. No specific language boundations were there.

**************************************Infrastructure Engineer**************************************
HR and Recruiters were all nice. However, the phone screen was horrible: the interviewer had a difficult accent and very arrogant attitude. While she saw I missed some design point, she didn't notify me until it was 25 minutes in the screen, despite the fact I clarified my design at the start and asked her if she had any concerns.When I asked her at the end about FB culture, she…  mentioned it, VERY ARROGANTLY, 4 times in as many sentences that FB looks for fast coders and they have a unique culture they are proud of and others have to adapt to it.She managed to make me not apply anymore to FB if I would work with the likes of her.

**************************************National Sales Director**************************************
Applied to one position on line and received a call a few days later from an internal recruiter with another group. Set up a phone interview for a week later. Pretty standard interview questions, nothing that I wasn't expecting especially after doing a little homework on the specific unit.

**************************************Software Engineer,**************************************
The first interview was at my University. It was your typical 45 minute face-to-face whiteboard coding style interview. During the first five minutes, my interviewer introduced himself and asked me questions about myself. Be prepared to talk about yourself and your resume. The next 35 minutes were spent entirely on 1 question. After arriving at a naive solution, I fined-tuned and optimized my code. The last 5 minutes were reserved…  for any questions I had.I passed the first interview, and went on to the second interview. The flew me down to HQ. This interview went horribly. The question was more difficult than the first interview, and my interviewer's accent made him difficult to understand. After the interview, I toured Facebook's campus and had lunch, etc.

**************************************SMB Sales**************************************
First interview is with an HR person, if you know what Facebook does in a very generic way and you know your CV and yourself you should be all set. it is probably harder to get the interview than to be successful in this one.Second interview is with a potential peer, you will get a case study you need to prepare and some behavioural questions afterwards. this one is a…  little more tricky, try to build some relationship with the interviewer and make it the mock call a conversation instead of a practiced set of questions (be agile and flexible to be able to adapt to the interviewer)Third interview is onsite, they say 'if you got to this place you did very well'. probably true, but in the end if you don't get the job, it doesn't bring you much. nonetheless, you did pretty well i guess. this one is t he hardest of all i personally found. you'll be set up with 4 interviews. all your different interviewers will have a different point of view, company fit, collaboration etc. these interviews are very demanding and challenging. the best way to prep for this is to check a lot of behavioural question and be able to provide examples.be concise, provide examples, don't talk about random stuff, just answer the question and don't try to go around it, show confidence and just show that you really want to work at FB

Contacted a couple of days after submitting CV. Was asked whether I would like to have the interview over the phone or Skype. Performed an interview over the phone even though I wished for it to be on Skype. Several standard questions regarding my background and CV. Was not contacted after the interview even though they said I would be within a couple of days. Sent them an email after…  over a month and was told i didn't get an offer. Overall an interesting experience.

**************************************Public Content Contractor**************************************
15 minute phone screen asking basic questions of what I've been up to and why I am interested in working at Facebook. Then I got asked during phone interview to come for an onsite later that week. The onsite was about 30 minutes with more in depth questions. She asked what I liked about the FB platform, what I didn't like about it. She asked me to explain a time…  in a previous job when I had failed. Interview was surprisingly easy. She told me at the end of interview that she would be in touch within 2 business days with an answer and I heard back less than 2 days that I got the offer.

I was referred to the interview process by an employee at Facebook. The actual process was conducted through PRO Unlimited, but I worked at Facebook headquarters to support an app they planned on releasing. The interview process was basic. I walked them through my resume and they asked me a few questions. The next step was writing a basic short response essay.

**************************************Software Engineering New Grad**************************************
I applies online and got a reference. Soon after received an email to schedule a phone conversation for a technical screen. Did coding on coderpad on a question which was:Find the minimum distance to a leaf node in a binary treeHad a short conversation on resume and projects and what Im looking for as well.

I contacted a recruiter through Linkedin. The recruiter got back to me and gave me the email of the person in charge of interviewing the students of my school. I sent an email to the guy in charge and he got back to me in 15 mins. He let me know that he will be forwarding my resume and I will hear back for an interview. I had a 1…  hour phone interview with a software engineer. Unfortunately, I did not go further than this.

I was referred by an employee and got the interview. It was a 45 minutes phone interview. The first question is standard and easy. The second question is more related to facebook. The interviewer is kind of helpful, but he seems have sth to do after the interview, so he cut off the line in about 40 minutes.

The whole process is blazing fast. back to back 3 rounds, no breaks and u r done. For me this was not favorable as I screwed up my first one and the bad state of mind persisted.

I applied through recruiter, then I got a phone interview. I had two algorithms which were not difficult. Then, I got an onsite interview. I had five interviews, two of them are algorithm problems, one research background (since I am a PhD student), one system design, and one ML design.

Asked an employee to refer me. Later that week contacted by an internal recruiter. Shortly afterward I had a phone screen interview.After a couple minutes on the interviewer's background and my own, we jumped directly into the coding question using coderpad. Unclear as to how detailed the solution was supposed to be solved, as there wasn't anything testing mechanisms (to my knowledge). Still wrote solidly in python.Two business days later,…  told I wasn't advancing in the process.

Had a phone interview. Was notified a week later and was then flown to the Seattle office for an onsite interview that consisted of 3 interviews. After my interview I had an unofficial lunch interview where I was shown the office and was given a chance to ask any questions I have about the company.

I applied with the referral from the internal employee and the recruiter contacted me within 2-3 days. The whole process was very efficient. I did one phone interview with an engineer and finished two coding questions and then received the onsite interview notification the same day. I did the onsite interview one week later in Menlo Park HQ. The interview included two rounds of coding sessions, one round of system…  design and one round culture-fit chatting with a manager.

Questions are all very standard. Coding on white board was challenging, because i'm not good at testing in my mind. They really value concise, correct, and efficient code. All questions were not hard, but interviewers wanted you to have a clear understanding and solution at the very beginning. You need to vocal about your idea and thoughts too.

Facebook came to my university's career fair and I briefly talked to one of their engineers and gave the recruiter my resume. They emailed me back within 1.5 weeks and invited me to do a 45 minute interview 1 week later on my school's campus. During the 45 minute on-campus interview, the interviewer asked me to briefly introduce myself and summarize a few highlights on my resume. Then he gave…  me a few simple coding questions to do on the whiteboard. He allowed me to use any language that I wanted to use. Also, the night before the campus interviews, Facebook hosted a reception at a pizza place so that all the interviewees could casually meet our interviewers beforehand. No need to dress up for a Facebook interview--they're very casual. My interview was wearing a t-shit.

On campus Interview, they eventually set up a date, and had a 40 minute interview. it was through our campus recruiting so it was a fairly easy process. They also had a reception with free food. Interview wasn't very difficult though I didn't get an offer, so they must have been looking for something else.

There's nothing much to say about my interview process that's not already been said. I was referred by an employee and they responded pretty promptly to my application. There were two rounds of phone interviews spaced a couple of weeks apart, and then a full day of on-site interviews. Facebook is becoming a big company, and this is apparent in some of their turn-around times. There used to be complete…  radio silence for a week or so before some news came in sporadically.I think did pretty well in the coding and other parts. The one part I knew I was weak in, and which the interview process corroborated, was the system design part. There are not too many resources to help prepare you for this, and this cannot be built up through preparation alone, you need to have been working in a lot of software projects, or better still, worked as an engineer to answer these questions well. I was sent in for a follow-up design interview on the phone after the on-site, and ultimately rejected.I don't have much to say. The coding questions are very standard. They're probably easier than they were earlier, and this again reflects the size of the company. The engineers I talked to seemed happy at Facebook, although the hacker culture, the quick and dirty way of doing things and the general focus around pushing stuff to production turned me off a little. I know that this is Facebook's culture beforehand, but coming face to face with it left a bad after-taste in my mouth. Or maybe the grapes are sour.

I was contacted after giving my resume at a job fair. I had one phone interview with an engineer which had a fairly straightforward interview problem to solve on an online coding website. Then I was invited to interview at one of their larger offices (I chose Seattle), I was flown out and interviewed on a day that 13 other people were interviewing as well. That day I got breakfast…  and lunch at the company cafeteria, and had interviews with 3 engineers. One asked me how I would implement, create and solve a maze. One asked me to code a translation from base 26 to decimal.

First got one phone interview invitation from a recruiter and it went fairly well. I heard back from my recruiter the next day to set up onsite interview. The onsite one includes 4 interviews (it was 3 before) and two of them are completely technical.For the other two, a mix of behavior and technical questions. The coding problems are not very hard but make sure your code is clean and…  bug-free.

After applying online I got a very casual recruiting email a few weeks later reaching out about a specific product engineering position, in fact I wasn't sure if it was real (wasn't addressed to me), but I looked up the recruiter and she was listed on linked in as employee of Facebook, so I responded. It took a while to decide if she could continue as my recruiter or if…  I needed to go through a university specific recruiter, but once my first phone interview was setup the process moved quite quickly.The first phone interview was a 45 minute coding interview. Pretty standard for the big companies. I completed 2 questions. What was the most unique about this process, is the feedback from that initial interview was shared with me by the recruiter - giving me that so I can improve on it for the in person interview, which I really think is a great reflection of Facebook's open culture.Facebook, like Google, generally doesn't hire for specific teams, however, they took the time to find a project at Facebook I would find especially interesting and fill my in person interview with people on that team so I could ask questions about it.Facebook has three types of interviews which they call Ninja, Pirate and Jedi (because they are the best kind of dorks). I had two Ninja Interviews and one Jedi. Ninja is typical coding interview where they ask 1-2 coding questions. The Jedi interview is culture fit where they ask you how you work on team, but you will also spend half the time coding. I think Pirate are focused on distributed systems type questions, but I was informed that they often skip these questions for New Grads without any explicit experience, because it's something most people learn from working in the industry and they don't get strong data from those interviews.It's also worth noting that during my job search I had coding interviews with 18 people and 17 of them were men, Facebook is the one company where I had a technical interview with a woman, although it was still the Jedi interview.I applied to Google at the same time as Facebook and their process moved a little faster, so I got an offer from Google the day before I went in for an in person interview, thankfully I had enough time to decide for Facebook to get their counter offer in, and the recruiter's care in setting me up with that team was a big part in what made me decide to go with Facebook.

I initially applied in early November, 2013. I got a reply from one of the recruiters about a week later. After talking to the recruiter on the phone and emailing back and forth for a while, she realized that I was still in school (graduating mid 2014) and transferred me to another recruiter.. or rather a bunch of different recruiters who couldn't seem to figure out who I should be…  talking to. Eventually we got everything sorted out (now in January 2014) and I did two phone interviews. They both went well and shortly after, they arranged for me to fly to Seattle for a "university day". They put me up in a nice hotel across the street from the office and, of course, paid for meals and everything. They even set up direct deposit for the reimbursement, which was nice.The day of the interviews, I arrived in the morning and signed in and then I was met by a couple recruiters. There were also a few intern candidates but no other full time candidates. I had 3 interviews that were all fairly interesting. The first one was mostly a fit interview, the second was the in depth coding interview and the third was a combination of talking about experience and doing some coding.After the interviews, we did a tour of the office and then we met with a bunch of engineers for a Q&A session. This was a really great way to learn about the company and see how everything works there. It seemed like a really great place to work with lots of really smart engineers though I was mildly concerned about the apparent lack of organization.In the afternoon, one of the recruiters took us downtown for Seattle's "Underground Tour" which was really neat and later they took us out to a super fancy Italian restaurant which was excellent. Overall, it was a really great day.About a week later, I got an email from one of the recruiters asking for references and my transcript. I have an almost perfect transcript (straight A's) and I was certain that my references would say nice things about me so I felt that I had the job in the bag at this point. One of my references forwarded me the questionnaire they sent him. It was just generic questions like "How did you know him?", "Would you hire him again?", "What were his strongest/weakest attributes?" This reference included his answers which were all extremely positive, re-enforcing the idea in my mind that I was going to get an offer.A week or so after this, I heard from the recruiter again asking me to do more phone interviews. Supposedly, it was "great news that [they] still [wanted] to move forward with [me]" but I didn't really take it that way. Frankly, I find it rude and unprofessional that they would waste the time of my references if they weren't already prepared to make an offer. However, I, of course, went through with the phone interviews, uncertain what they could possibly learn about me that they hadn't already figured out in the first five interviews.The first of the second round of phone interviews (6th interview overall) went very poorly as the interviewer has a very strong accent and a horrible phone line (lots of static). I could barely understand what he was asking which made it very difficult. I contacted the recruiter about this and she seemed at least somewhat understanding. She then booked another phone interview which went quite well, as far as I could tell.Finally, the week after this (now into March), I got a rejection letter which I was rather dumbfounded by. I can't for the life of me figure out where I went wrong or why they would bother contacting references if they weren't prepared to make an offer.

I had an in person first round screen interview. Then I had a second round which consisted of 4 interviews. 2 coding interviews, 1 higher level designing a system interview and a personality fit+coding interview. Topics covered included, scheduling for the designing a system, fast sorting for arrays with structure, binary search, recursion and bit wise operations.

Initially applied online, but did not hear back after a couple weeks. Asked a friend to submit a referral and I was contacted within 24 hours. I was working up against a deadline, and they were able to set up the phone screen quickly. After the phone screen, I was notified they would like to bring me on-site.The on-site interviews went quickly and smoothly. During one of my interviewers, I…  had to inform the interviewer twice in a row that I had seen the question before on an interview (which was embarrassing, but we quickly moved on to a question I hadn't seen).After contacting my references, Facebook e-mailed me about 10 days later to let me know they were going to make an offer.

Employee referral, 2 weeks later a email from the recruiter. Schedule a phone interview for 1 week from recruiter contact. Software engineer contacted me and told me about what he did and asked me what I like to do and then onto the coding problem. Everyone was very friendly

First a phone screen, then 3 onsite interviews, 45 minutes eachPhone screen - Print a tree, level by level. Write all solutions for a^3+b^3 = c^3 + d^3, where a, b, c, d lie between [0, 10^5]On site - 1. Print a list in reverse 2. Stress interview 3. Maximum profit for buying selling a stock given an array of prices for n days. Isomorphic trees

I was selected for an on-campus screening interview. The interview was pretty easy compared to other companies. After the initial ice breakers, was asked an open ended question related to area of my interest followed by 2 coding questions to be solved on a paper. Basic questions testing if you can write code and know data structures. Was informed in a couple of hours that I am selected for on-site…  interview.The process to select the dates and flights, hotels was smooth. There were about 30-40 other new grad candidates and intern on the day of interview. Every new grad had just 3 coding interviews one of which was behavioral interview for checking if the candidate would be a good fit. The other two were ninja coding interviews. I had two coding questions in the behavioral round which I answered well. Two question in the first ninja round which were pretty wasy and I coded pretty quickly but messed up a basic thing in the first question. Had time for only one question in the second ninja round. This was the only tougher question in the interviews and I got the ideal answer in the end but didn't have time to finish the coding part.I think the basic mistake in the second interview and the third interview messed up my chances. I feel the company puts importance on how fast you come up with perfect answer. That's the questions are simple. So you are expected to be quick thinking and are expected to not mess up something so simple.There was lunch, awesome tour of campus and two tech talk after the interviews. This was one of the best interview days I had this season (I have had 4 on-site interview till now). No all day long torture of interviews and pretty awesome talks and tour giving an inside view of the company. Would interview again if given a chance!

- Since I was applying for Mobile Front-End Engineer, I had to code a 4x4 tiles puzzle game compatible on a mobile device (either web app, iOS, or Android).- One formal 10 minutes phone call about how things were going to proceed for the next couple of interviews.- A 45 minutes interview with an engineer from the research team. Basic first 10 minutes to answer questions about my professional past,…  25 for technical questions, and 10 for me to ask him questions.

A friend who's an engineer there passed my resume along. Had two phone interviews which I found quite difficult. They both had me code in collabedit.org, and the second also actually ran my code on codepad.org - that was a surprise! I did not do perfectly on the phone interview questions, but still got through.They brought me on-site for an interview day which included a tour, lunch, a talk, and…  four 1:1 interviews. One-half of the first interview included some questions about leadership, teamwork etc., and the rest were all technical. One of the interviewers seemed to be in a grumpy mood, but that's the luck of the draw. The whiteboard coding questions were not too bad and I think I got them all, though with some silly mistakes along the way. I'd agree with the previous reviewer who said their questions are not as difficult as Google's- though perhaps they therefore have higher expectations as to how quickly/flawlessly you solve them.On my way out they gave me a goodie bag with some swag. Oh, and at one point I saw Zuckerberg milling about. Got an email a week or so later- I would not be winning the Facebook IPO lottery!

Facebook came to our career fair and I applied online. I received an on campus interview. Their fulltime interview process for new grads works like the following:1 on 1 interview with a Facebook Engineer (1st day)1 on 1 interview with a Facebook Engineer (2nd day, if you did well enough the first day)On site interview at Facebook HQTheir interviews are almost completely technical.

I've applied from facebook.com/careers and 3 weeks later a recruiter sent an email that they were interested in to make an interview. They were very kind and interested. I got a detailed instruction about the process. Also they gave me some blog posts or other links that I've already found at my company research. They said that the phone interview worth to prepare and I may take time to study.…  I wanted 2 weeks to get ready and they accepted that. Than, someone else (another recruiter) got in touch to create the schedule of phone interview. After creating appointment, before that 2 weeks, they called me to just talk. It took about 5 mins. I asked some questions about the company and recruitment process.After two weeks I got a call and that was an engineer. He asked me some questions about my background. After answers, I've signed in to an online editor to write some code in shared session. They asked two algorithm questions and I thought I was not so bad. After these questions, he asked to me that do I have any question about company or technology. I've asked something to just ask. He answered them very kindly and detailed. After 45 mins at talk, he said that's time to go.About 5 hours later, I got an email from the first recruiter that I'm not suitable. Also the recruiter has added as a contact on linkedin. That was completely sign of they are nice and they want über people.

I applied through my university and some Facebook engineers came to my campus to hold the interviews. Most applicants were for internships but a couple of us applied for full-time, however only internship positions were offered at the end of the interviews. The interviews were all 1 on 1 using a whiteboard for the problems.

I applied online,using the friendly Facebook career website.I received an email followed by informal phone interview.Afterwards,I got the chance for a tech interview.The first questions were a little general,tell me about yourself kind of thing.previous experience and the challenges faced.There were 2 coding problems, one based on recursion,factorial kind of thing...And afterwards ,a question on merging two sorted arrays in linear time.My approach solved the problem in quadratic time and…  was asked to improve it to the best I can.At first I couldn't really see how;but the interviewer was really nice.He gave me hints to start with. At first I stumbled because I could not immediately get the whole idea.I kept on saying stuff without changing the code until I said the right thing and he agreed with me afterwards.I am waiting to hear the outcome of the interview which I have hope I passed and will get the chance to work with such wonderful and humble people.I really liked the guy,so down to earth...I feel like crying right now...

I applied online and was approached by the HR to initiate the interview process. My next interview was a technical one and I had hoped to clear it, but failed. The interviewer was helpful, but failed to see my perspective. I initially approached to solve the problem in O(N) time using an algorithm that I thought I knew. But I got confused and 15 mins in the interview, I asked…  whether I could use another approach. This is when I got shaky. I proposed a solution in O(N^2) time. He asked to make it faster and using Hash Tables, I improved the time to O(N) and space to O(N). And with a hint from the interviewer, I ended up solving in O(N) time with constant space (and then started writing the code). During the whole interview session, I accidentally kept confusing things (for instance calling a node,a root node because I was thinking in terms of sub-trees and recursively). This generally doesn't happen even when working under stress. I felt the interviewer grossly underestimated me, but I blame myself for that. If there is anything I would different then it would be to use the easiest approach to solution the question first. A positive start boosts up the confidence. Make sure to explain CLEARLY (using the correct terminology) how to tackle the problem. One more thing: embrace the fact that there is always a possibility of getting rejected. So, blurt out whatever you solution you think should work. There is not enough time to derive your approach. And be confident. Sometimes you can trick the interviewer into believing that you know exactly what to do, even when you don't (if you are close enough).

I applied online at the Facebook website. They came for a tech talk in my university.After a few days I got an email for a phone call. It wasn't a technical interview. Just a brief introductory call. After the call they setup a technical interview.The technical phone interview involves coding on colabedit.

Interviewing process was very smooth and recruiters provided me with information and feedback almost instantaneously, for example, I heard back that I passed phone interview stage 6hrs after.As I applied to NYC office they offered to fly me there for interviews but due to lack of time interviewed in London and loved office atmosphere.Can't provide onsite questions due to NDA but had 2 coding ninja interviews and 1 jedi fit…  interview.Process took quite long as I asked for time in between interviews to prepare better.

2 Rounds of Phone Interview4 Interviews on-site.Coding + Fit Interview- Behavorial Questions=> What do you love about Facebook?=> Would you be able to survive such an environment where you are facing millions of users as the customer?Coding Interview= Questions belowCoding Interview= Questions belowFit Interview=> Describe and talk about a project you had that was most challenging and learning.

Got call through campus hiring. Set up an initial phone call with interviewer who gave details on kind of work and environment at facebook.followed by coding question on collabedit. It was easy and pretty much coded what was asked for. But got a reject mail within an hour.

On-campus interview, 45 minutes, no behavioral questions, just two technical programming questions, write on the board.Two programming questions & answers can be found easilyNice interview process, but I have not prepared at all, rejected as expected

I had 2 phone interviewsthey called me for on-site interviewI had 3 on-site interviewsgot offergonna start this year

I got this interview from a campus career fair, so I had a 30 minute 1:1 interview with one of the recruiters on campus.

It was a campus interview. I got into the 2nd round. Both rounds were about a coding task in 45 minutes. The first one was to design a data structure for indicating the position and the value of data. The second was to access a data from a tree structure.

**************************************SMB Account Manager, Turkish**************************************
First of all they send me an email and we arrange time and date for phone call interview.They called me and we talked about 20 min.Asked for my job experience.My current job role and what i am doing here?What is my responsibilities?Hom many account do i have?

**************************************Intellectual Property Ops**************************************
Phone, writing sample, phone, then in person. Rather standard for tech. Overall, positive experience. No surprise questions. Just prep behavioral and have a good "why." Note that it's really based less on experience and more about a fit for the team. For the most part, each interviewer was nice and prepared. The recruiter was helpful and it was a very well coordinated process.

**************************************Product Generalist**************************************
There were two coding questions. The first question was easy and the second one (a bit harder) was basically an optimization of the first question. The interviewer didn't really ask anything else, and straight away went to the coding questions after talking about himself for a bit. Also, he sort of implicitly wanted the answers to be in Python.

**************************************Summer Intern**************************************
Was initially invited to participate in an interview on campus. Was very casual, and the interviewer was generally nice.About two weeks later, received an email inviting me to come to the home office for an additional interview.There were three interviews, one with a senior product developer, two with developers recruited from my university. All focused on personality and all involved basic algorithmic type programming questions. Be proficient in coding on…  a whiteboard.

**************************************Software Developer Manager**************************************
Nine interviews in total, two remotely and seven on site. The process itself lead me to loose interest in the company and at the very end, turned down the offer.

**************************************Operations Applications Architect**************************************
I was contacted by an internal HR recruiter based on a previous contact with Facebook HR via linkedin. I was given an overview of the position by the HR recruiter and a basic set of weed-out questions to answer. After that I was scheduled for a phone interview with the technical interviewer. The technical interview consisted of some more detail about the job and two scripting tests in a shared…  collaborative environment and one obscure problem to solve. The first script was to check some number of hosts for a daemon and send email about the hosts that did not have the daemon running. The second was to take a very large list of hosts and see if any were missing by comparing it to a reference list. This really only requires a diff and the interviewer seemed baffled by that solution so he changed the problem to require generating the reference file also. The third question was about accessing files in a directory used as an NFS mount point that had an active mount on top of it. The interviewer explained that the position was an interface between development and operations to avoid difficult deployments due to assumptions one group makes about the others intentions so it would require experience with both development and operations.

**************************************Data Scientist - Analytics**************************************
The first step was a recruiter phone interview. We went over my skills and background (mostly based on the info I provided on my resume). The recruiter also gave me detailed info about the position, the job location and generally about the company.The second step was a video interview with the hiring manager. This interview involved SQL, Python, Product Analytics and basic Machine Learning. This stage went really well.The final…  stage was the on-site interview. There were 5 interviews in total. 2 of them involved Product Analytics. 2 of them involved coding and data manipulation and one was purely statistics and probability.It was a great interview overall but I got an offer somewhere else that I really wanted and had been waiting for and had to discontinue the interview process.

**************************************Mobile Partnership BD**************************************
Long drawn out process. FB initially contacted me and the screening call/process was timely. Then the follow up was drawn out over 3 months. A new VP hiring slowed schedule as the group re-assessed needs. I ended up initiating multiple calls to recruiter to get status updates. The recruiter was forthcoming with status when I reached him. Interviewed with 5 members of mobile team including lawyer, BD mgr, program mgrs,…  partner support. Basic questions about what/who is considered best partner, what/who is considered competition, how to engage partners, past responsibilities related to partnerships. One BD mgr was particularly arrogant about himself and his role and the interaction was difficult. He bad mouth a couple of his partners.

**************************************Business Development Manager**************************************
The first step was a phone screen with the recruiter who asked general questions about my background, current job, etc. From there, I was invited in for a 1st round on-site interview that lasted an hour. The on-site was a mix of getting-to-know you questions alongside in-depth questions on recommendations for better leveraging FB tools and plugins, potential partnerships, etc. Afterwards, the recruiter set up time to talk by phone…  and let me know the role wasn't a fit but that she'd pass my resume along to other teams.

To date, I have only participated in an initial recruiting interview via phone. The format was fairly informal, very much conversation like and positive overall. I was able to share in detail my background and also able to ask questions about the role, the team, the career path and overall organizational structure.

**************************************Software Intern**************************************
For interns: 2 rounds of on-campus interviews. You need to answer at least 3 questions in the 2nd round. The interviewers are nice and supportive in general, and helpful if you need clarification of the problem. Both interviews are entirely technical. On average, you need to solve one question in 15 mins, and that includes coding on paper and testing with some of your own cases.

**************************************Security Analyst**************************************
The overall experience was great. However, it would be better if they specified what the role is about. I interviewed in the eCrime team. But the job requirements were not clear. I prepared for some basic eCrime things and the role required completely different things. It would be better if they specified what is expected from me.

was contacted by a recruiter and told i may be a good fit. had a screening phone interview with recruiter. they scheduled a phone interview for me to speak with the hiring manager. felt like the interview went well was told id be contacted with next steps within a week.never heard back from anyone at fb.emailed the recruiter.no response.i expected fb to be more professional. i've now adjusted my expectations…  of them.

**************************************Technical Project Manager**************************************
Initial contact and screening took place over Facebook messenger. It was a little odd, being the first interview I'd ever had over a chat system. But it at least got me in the door. There was another phone screen after that with a member of the team, then they brought me onsite. I met with 5 people and it lasted most of the day. Some were good solid interviews with…  real people who liked to have a conversation and get real information. Some were very cold interviews literally read off a script right in front of me without making any eye contact. I was surprised at the range of interviewing skills and styles.In the end, I was not offered the job. However, I was never actually told "no". I was only told "we're meeting later this week to discuss" or "there are a few more candidates to get through before we make a decision" and "just wait one more week and we'll have more information." They eventually just stopped answering my emails for a status. I got the hint, and probably for the best.

**************************************Rotational Product Manager**************************************
After being referred, I was contacted for a BlueJeans video call several weeks later. I was asked a pretty broad question, "How could we expand Search on Facebook in new ways?" and in truth I completely flubbed on the answer, and wound up giving a word-salad, garbled response. Super disappointed in my performance because it's a really valid, interesting question.This was in part due to the fact that I had…  gotten sick earlier in the day, and also due to the fact that our BlueJeans call kept cutting out. We eventually switched to phone, but our connection was extremely poor and I had to run to the roof of my apartment building while answering questions to find a good connection.I guess the moral of the story is:1) Call your recruiter to reschedule an interview if you're sick the day of an interview and don't think you'll perform your best.2) Make absolutely, 3000% sure that your internet connection and phone connection is reliable before your interview.

I applied through an employee and got contacted by a recruiter for a screening. I'm assuming that went well since I got asked to do a video interview the following week.The video interview was with a current product manger, which seemed to be going well until I was asked to ask any questions I had. I asked a simple, basic question about why the employee interviewing me chose to work…  at Facebook, the response was a snicker and being told that it was a stupid question.His response was that working at Facebook is like "playing in the Superbowl" compared to other tech companies around. I wish he had mentioned the diversity of culture, which is really important to me and given all of Facebook's publicity about promoting women in tech, I was excited to interview and potentially join the company.The tone of the interview changed when I was faced with the interviewer's arrogance because I was not impressed with being told I asked a stupid question and got an arrogant response. I was not willing to work for a pompous culture, I implore anyone with true intelligence to not waste their time interviewing there. It is a fantastic, impactful company but not worth the haughty culture.

**************************************Software Engineering, Infrastructure Engineering**************************************
I was referred by a friend and started with a phone interview which didn't last more than 10 minutes due to some issues on the interviewers side. I Was told I had to go through a different recruitment team and that I would be contacted by them. 2 months later, the friend that referred me asked about my status, and I was again contacted by the same guy as before.…  He seamed confused since he believed we had spoken the previous month when it had been almost exactly two. He also believed we had gone over a practice question to prepare for a technical interview which certainly did not happen. This call ended with me set up for a technical interview for a position I was horribly under qualified for, but I needed interview practice so I went along with it. I then received an email with tips for Facebook technical interviews which I thought was a great help at the time. I was told to practice with a certain collaborative code website, so I set up an account and got to practicing.When the technical interview started I was told to open a different website which is fine, whatever. The question wasn't too difficult in hind site, but either I was confused or it wasn't explained properly because it took some back and forth before I could solve the problem. I got the n^2 solution quickly enough, but the linear solution took me longer than I'd care to admit. It was a fairly simple array problem.

**************************************Analyst, SMB Growth, Global Marketing Solutions**************************************
I was contacted by the recruiter for the above position based in Austin TX. Because I was overseas and traveling extensively at the time, we scheduled an interview only after 3 weeks.Although friendly over e-mail, the recruiter was brusque and curt over the phone. It was as if she was obligated to talk to me, and didn't particularly care about my answers. Either that or she was having an impossibly…  bad day at work.Toward the end, she told me more about the role and next steps. Similar to a prior interview review, she sounded like a robot/airline stewardess going through the motions. I could tell that the interview didn't go well from the moment I picked up the phone.Either my answers to her questions were way off the mark (which I don't think they were--the questions were very straightforward: what kind of ad solutions does Facebook offer?), or within that 3 week period while waiting for my scheduled interview, the position was no longer available and had already been filled.

**************************************Product Analytics**************************************
Submitted a resume online and contacted a recruiter with whom I had spoken a few years before. Two phone interviews, one problem-solving/fit-based (design metrics, experiments to test a new feature, etc) and one more technical (algorithms, coding). Came on-site for a full day of interviews, ranging from technical (SQL, probabilities) to problem-solving/analysis process, to culture and fit (why do you want to work at Facebook)? The interview process moved VERY…  fast.

My process was triggered by an employee referral from a former colleague and a competing interview process with Google (which has a remarkably similar process). For all interviews, feedback was received within one business day.Phone interview 1 - Basic recruiter phone screen asking about why you want to work there and some ideas you have to improve Facebook products.Phone interview 2 - Technical interview phone screen asking a series of…  probability and technical interviews performed in collabedit, a desktop sharing tool. The difficulty of the questions increases as you prove your competence and was more difficult technically than I experienced with Google.Phone interview 3 - General analytics phone screen with questions about previous analytics experience and background. There are some analytics case questions both in general and regarding Facebook to see the way you think.On site interviews - I had 4 on site interviews in the Menlo Park office that were performed by analytics managers and a product manager. The interviews all asked a lot of questions and ranged from behavioral questions to very specific technical ones. The behavioral ones focused on handling difficult scenarios like when you are unsure of data integrity or naming your proudest accomplishments from your last jobs. The interview with the product manager was by far my most difficult and asked extremely specific business questions that you might work on in a given day.After the interviews are complete, you get a verbal lead from the recruiter indicates how feedback is going, followed by a verbal offer a few days later and a written one.

HR is very helpful and informative. They keep everyone in the loop throughout the process. They present the company very well and are encouraging. If they don't think you're a good fit for a position, they generally will look at other positions that you may fit well and automatically consider you for that.

**************************************Team Lead - User Operations**************************************
I interviewed for a team lead role in their growing Austin, TX office thanks to a referral from a current employee in that office. I was surprised when the call came from their San Francisco recruiting team, even more so that the recruiter didn't realize I was in Austin, recruiting for an Austin role.Upon starting the interview, it was very evident the recruiter was young and inexperienced given his questions…  and his reactions. I've interviewed a lot lately, and felt as if I was talking to a wall. This might have happened because my technical knowledge and experience seemed to be over his head, and he was probably just reading from a script. e.g. "Tell me about yourself and why you applied" .... then right into the next question, "Have you ever led a team" .... next question "Tell me a time when you solved a problem". It was rather frustrating because my resume clearly stated that I had managed multiple teams (up to 100 people) over the years.Afterwards, he said he was excited to pass my resume on to the actual team I'd be working with and then get back to me about the next step. When I didn't hear in a week, I followed up, and then followed up after three weeks - no response, ever. It's safe to say they weren't interested, but given that it took them almost two months to call me up after I submitted my referred resume, and never got back to me afterwards, I'd say it's best to just pass these guys up. They are moving too fast for their own good.

**************************************CMMS Planner**************************************
Phone screen with recruiter - discussed back ground and strengths.Phone interview with site personnel - bank of questions to go through. They want to know what you like to do in your free time as well.One on One interview all day with many people- many disciplines in and out of the affected organization.

**************************************Some Type of Recruiting Role - I Didn't Apply - They Contacted Me**************************************
I had a phone call with a tenured recruiter. I could tell this person had been at FB for way too long. There was no selling or even an attempt to pattern match the role she was calling about with my experience. (I'm in a leadership position with progressive recruiting experience - she was calling about an hourly contract position with no defined roles or team that I would be…  supporting.) She mentioned the company will be doubling next year and they need a lot of recruiters.

**************************************Team Lead**************************************
Got the interview through a headhunter after leaving the military. Interviewed at Menlo Park on multiple occasions for multiple positions. Because this wasn't a technical job, questions weren't too difficult, lots of variations on standard questions regarding leadership experience, teamwork skills, etc. Heavy focus on teamwork and fit with the company culture. It felt great to go to an interview in blue jeans.

I have one technical skype interview. The atmosphere was very frendly, questions were not very hard. So there is nothing to worry about. Going to have a next stage in the office soon.

Took 2 weeks from first contact to final onsite interviews. But they delayed sharing the results by almost 1 month. Had 2 telephonic interviews by 1 associate and 1 team lead. Facebook has a fairly flat org structure and hence these two people had the authority for pre-onsite screening for this position. Onsite interview included 4 back to back rounds with 4 stakeholders - Business Manager, Principal, Team Lead and…  an Associate

**************************************Marketing Internship**************************************
Screening first round.They begin by setting the agenda, "we are going to take 5 minutes to talk about the job, and then the first question you will answer is, "Tell me about you, and why you want to work at Facebook."Tell me about (Current job), how what three things you did to make Project X successful.Tell me about how you have worked cross-functionally.Do you have any questions for meTell me…  how you implemented scalable solutionsTell me a time when you ran a marketing campaign and what was the result.How would you get a small business to use Facebook advertisingDo you have any questions for me

**************************************Content Strategist, Advertising Insights**************************************
First Round Screening:The recruiter reached out to me via email and gave me a 1 week notice to set up time for a call.We had our call 1 week later. She explained the job thoroughly to her best knowledge. The questions she asked were very standard that related to the job description that she sent.Second Round Screening:After speaking with the recruiter, we set up time for a call with someone…  on the team. This time around didn't feel very smooth. The person I talked was doing the call internationally due to some conference. I feel like with this knowledge on hand, Facebook shouldn't have scheduled me to talk to someone who was abroad for work, because everything just felt bad after.BeginningThe call was scheduled for 9 am and was to last 30-45 minutes. The call started 15 minutes late due to some technical issues with overseas calling. I ended up having to call the interviewer myself. This immediately set the tone and mood for the next 30 minutes, because both parties were probably anxious, flustered, and stressed, and the interviewer was rushed to get the details out since we lost 15 minutes. The call didn't feel friendly/welcoming.MiddleThe interviewer rambled through the entire conversation and gave extremely vague/topline descriptions and answers. When the interviewer talked about the position, he/she made it sound very convoluted from what the recruiter told me and what I had discussed with someone else on the team. I also felt like he/she didn't really know the job details very well and couldn't explain the job. I got a better explanation from the recruiter and the person I talked to who was the manager on the team.When the interviewer asked basic behavioral questions, he/she was very abrasive and trying to almost disqualify my projects and experience.EndThe conversation didn't end as I expected either, because when I asked 1) if I'll be working with you and 2) what are the next steps, he/she gave very lackluster responses. He/she was in a rush to get off the phone and responded with "no, you won't be working with me, only here and there" and "I don't know what the next steps are, I just get told who to call".I completely understand if the person doesn't know what next steps are, but I would have appreciated speaking to someone who I would work with, report to, or even worked on the team to get a fair assessment and evaluation.

**************************************Ad Manager**************************************
Nice people, somehow disorganized process

**************************************Software Development Engineer Summer**************************************
I had three interviews, did well in the first and the third round. Engineers are very friendly, firstly he has asked me some behavioral questions, then 1 or 2 algorithm questions. It is not very easy, I have to come up with the solution in a very short time. Questions are: 1. Rotate LinkedList (Leetcode) 2. Read 4k (Leetcode) 3. Buy and Sell Stock

**************************************Information Security and Policy Analyst**************************************
I was initially contacted by a recruiter from FB. Had a phone screen with the recruiter, then moved onto a phone interview with one of the (the only) team members. That was followed up by another phone call with the recruiter. Then I was scheduled for an on-site/in-person interview at HQ in Menlo Park. I was flown out by FB, put up in a hotel overnight. I paid to rent…  my own car, though they do allow up to $400 to be expensed for the interview process if you're not local.Overall it wasn't a horrible experience, very typical of most tech company interviews. However, I'm rating it negative because of the final interview I had. Due to FB scheduling my interview for a Monday, I had to fly back home that night as I had meetings I was leading at work on Tuesday morning. Because of this, FB rescheduled my final interview to be a video conference. Would have been nice if they had just adjusted my interview time to start earlier in the morning than 11 AM.I felt like everything had gone well for the interview process up until the VC interview. I would like to point out that FB recruited me. I did not apply for any specific position there, nor did I ever submit my resume for employment there. So the VC interview rolls around, and the first thing that happens is this person interviewing me jumps all over me for a few grammatical errors on my resume. And this person doesn't get off this particular subject for a good several minutes, which sets the tone for the rest of the interview. As you can guess, the rest of the VC interview didn't go all that well. This person had already made up their mind based on some grammatical errors on my resume.Listen FB, I know you think you rule the world and some of your employees think they are God's gift to technology and humanity, but when you recruit people for positions, it would behoove you as a company to remind the interviewers of this fact. I think that even if you had offered, I would have declined based upon the experience I had with this final interviewer. I just cannot get over how poorly I was treated given the circumstances. YOU recruited me! Remember that!I'd also note that at no point were salary or benefits ever discussed, and that's kind of a big deal when you're trying to recruit someone for a job in Silicon Valley where housing prices are absolutely insane.

**************************************Software Developer Internship**************************************
I applied through my school career system. First came an on campus interview where they asked 2 questions, one simple one on strings and one medium difficulty on tree traversal. Next came onsite interviews. Spent the day there but only had one interview. Overall I had a good experience.

**************************************Legal Interview**************************************
I was contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn and asked to send in my resume. We then set up a phone screening with another recruiter. They then contacted me to move forward with a video interview with a few members of the relevant legal department. The video interviews were with potential team members and were about 30 minutes with each individual. The questions were fairly straightforward and involved prior experience…  and demonstrating skills relevant to the job.

**************************************Online Marketing Specialist**************************************
Analytical test + essay question in the language of the country you are applying for + following series of phone & Skype interviews.Recruiter would ask mostly about your personality, past experiences, and see if your qualifications and personality fit the company. You have to know the market the very well for this position.

**************************************Product Manager(RPM)**************************************
University Recruiting for rotational product manager position. Went through 2 phone interviews and then a final round. Was asked questions about product sense, leadership, and metrics. Interviewed with PMs from various facebook teams. No programming questions as they look at both business and computer science backgrounds.

**************************************Project Management**************************************
Phone screening first. Day-long interview scheduled after a successful phone interview. Met with about 6 people over a four-hour period of time. Roles and responsibilities ranged from potential peers to other managers. Most questions focused around the resume, with a few skill questions thrown in the mix. Overall good experience.

**************************************Senior Solutions Engineer**************************************
Facebook recruiter emailed me and it was a perfect match for my profile. So I started digging up glassdoor and other sites on what to expect. And then I turned to leetcode and started studying common algorithms questions.Call with recruiter: She was great, explained the role in detail, cared whether it aligns with my interest and my profile. And mentioned that there will be 2 phone interviews and then an…  on-site interview.First interview and second phone interview went very well, I cannot imagine anything that I would have done better in these two interviews.But got an email from recruiter that they would like to go with the third phone screen before they can call me on-site.Third interview: Interviewer explains me a problem which is similar to a 3sum problem and asks me to write a solution for it. I hadn't 'summarized' the solution and, this how it goes between me and the interviewer:Me: "The problem you are explaining is quite similar to a well known problem of 3sum"She: "Yes"Me: (explained the approach,the time and space complexities associated with it of 3sum)She: "Lets see some code"(I start writing the code and continuously explain what I am doing. Once I write the core algorithm I told her)Me: "So this is the core algorithm, and we just need to add null checks and add corner cases."She: "OK lets go thru your algorithm, how will it behave in (this corner case)"Me: "As I mentioned, this is the core of the algorithm, we still need to do null checks and consider corner cases."I add null checks and 2 corner cases and then we started going through lot of scenarios, my code holds good in all of them and the interview continues like normal. So, I thought I had aced this interview too.I get an email from the recruiter saying they will pass for now. I ask for the feedback and they mention that I used 'brute force method' to implement (a certain corner case). I said to myself, I was still implementing the algorithm, ofcourse you will run through many scenarios before you call the code done.But I guess others out there are right, interviewers at facebook wants bookish knowledge. It doesnt matter how many years of experience, you still need to topple all the algorithm books and go summarize leetcode before the interview. Your experience, your profile, the projects that you have worked on and your 'non algorithm' technical knowledge doesnt matter or may be it matters only after the fact that you have successfully summarized algorithms.And, its not like I am disillusioned.I am a Senior dev, in my early 30s working for a quite good corporation in the valley and I have been interviewing, hiring and mentoring junior dev from many many years now. And the fact that I didnt even clear a phone screening is quite interesting to me.I am quite disappointed and it makes me think: Did the recuriter reached out to me even though there were none actual positions open? Or did it get filled up somewhere in the middle and I got a 'false' reason for rejection?

**************************************Applications Engineer Intern**************************************
I got the call for a technical interview through a Referral. I was asked about :1) Myself2) One of my projects and how I could improve them.3) Code for a String PalindromeIt was unexpectedly pretty straight forward. Some corner cases that I was asked to think about in my String palindrome code were a little difficult to think of instantly.

**************************************SMB Analyst**************************************
Submitted my resume directly through Facebook and received a message from a recruiter pretty quickly (same day). One I had my initial phone call with her I had 2 additional calls with members of the SMB team. Everyone was incredibly nice and professional. They asked some hypothetical questions that make you think on your feet but were fun to work out. Once I had completed these 3 phone interviews I…  was flown to Austin for 4 back to back in person interviews. I thought theses went well however I was initially under-qualified for the position with no background as an Analyst or in Advertising for that matter so understandably they passed. Overall it was a great experience though and I learned a lot along the way that has since helped with other employment opportunities.

I applied through Facebook. Sent resume and was contacted by recruiter in Menlo park. It was a general behavioral interview with specific questions about small business experience. Recruiter seemed to respond positively and set up phone call with hiring manager. Phone call never happened, no follow up. I felt that recruiter was difficult to follow up with but it is understandable considering this position would have lots of applicants. I…  felt that not being called at scheduled interview with hiring manager was a negative part of the process.

**************************************Network Operations**************************************
One word: disorganized. On more than one occasion, internal recruiters scheduled phone screens and failed to alert me that one had been scheduled, much less when it would be. Did not go past first technical screen, although I don't know if it was because of the scheduling issues or just the result of the first screen. Technical screen was reasonable.

**************************************Windows Systems Administrator**************************************
I was/am currently employed and not looking for a new job but was contacted by an independent recruiter about a position with facebook. I say this to give you an understanding of my state of mind. I agreed to be presented and submit my resume because it's Facebook, right?I was passed to an in house recruiter to schedule a phone interview with another in house recruiter. I spoke to the…  in house recruiter for 30 minutes. I was surprised. The recruiter was pretty thorough with the preliminary tech stuff. I was told I would be contacted if they wanted to move me forward.Two weeks passed and the original independent recruiter said they weren't interested. What's even more fascinating is this independent recruiter basically said the staff there were very arrogant!Fast forward two months and I get contacted directly from an in house recruiter that verified i never spoke with any facebook IT staff. She set up another phone interview with in house staff.( Anyone else starting to get uncomfortable?)I then received an email confirming the phone interview from yet another in house recruiter(good lord, how many recruiters do you really need?) and asking me to email back my confirmation.Phone interview with in house staff went smoothly. They asked me about my experience and I was very comfortable since I have extensive experience. I did admit to being out of touch with the email technology because I have other peers that do the day to day stuff. They really need an email admin. In my opinion, if that's the case, drop the rest of the job description. People who do email at companies with 2000+ employees have very little time to be really good at much else. We covered standard windows admin stuff and afterwards, he said the recruiter would be in touch.That's when the entire process fell off the tracks. I never heard back from anyone from Facebook. I figured oh well.That is until my coworker and I started comparing notes. Turns out he had also been contacted! We sit across from each other for goodness sakes! We determined between the two of us that Facebook's internal staff has been trying to fill this same position for 6+ months. It appears they may have hired and fired two people for the position already. After my phone interview, the position seemed to have gotten changed to a contract to hire position! That was early 2010. The position is back on their site again right now.The valley is kinda small when it comes to experienced admins so my friends and I have been passing the info around. For those of us with families, this could potentially be a risky position.At the end of the day, it doesn't matter. It's Facebook and they will eventually go IPO. If you get the job, suck it up and count yourself lucky(and soon to be millionaire!)

**************************************Measurement Lead**************************************
I interviewed for two roles. The first one did not work out. The recruiter was terrible in a way that she just ignored my followup emails. The second role is pending since I still do not know the result. The second recruiter is equally terrible. Facebook recruiter are just wasting my time. Very unprofessional!

**************************************Sales Operations**************************************
After applying through a friend that worked there, they called me within a couple of days. I had 2 phone interviews - one was with the recruiter and the other was with the hiring manager. I was told by the recruiter that I made it to the next phase, which I thought was a bit odd since I didn't think it went well since the hiring manager asked nothing about…  my technical skills or background and only asked silly, cliche questions one can expect to get from a tech company. I was asked to complete a case study but the recruiter later called to tell me that they decided to move in another direction. Overall I thought the recruiter was really nice and professional throughout the process, however I got the impression that there was already a decision made about my candidacy before even speaking to them.

**************************************Analyst, User Operations**************************************
started with an initial phone screen, followed by a phone interview consisting of behavioral questions, then an onsite with 5 1:1 interviews, each taking 20-30 minutes

The position will be at the European HQ for the position of Thai Analyst, User Operations.I had a brief phone call from the HR informing me about the 2 tests I had to do: Writing test and Analytical test.A week later she contacted me that I passed to the next step and there will be another HR calling me. After the interview I had 2 interview with one employee and…  a line manager.

**************************************Team Lead SMB**************************************
The interview process was lengthy and in depth. A lot of focus was placed on 'Why Facebook' Everything about the interview is what you would expect. I felt that I was being interviewed by a lot of folks that were short on time.

**************************************Product Operations Team Lead**************************************
Got a response to my application after about 2 weeks. Emailed back and forth with recruitment to set up an initial phone interview. That went really well and they set up a 2nd phone interview for me a couple of days later with the manager of the department. The 2nd phone interview was made up of all the same questions as the 1st which I found quite annoying but it…  was fine. I got a call from recruitment a couple of days later to schedule 4 face to face interviews in the office with members of the team. The whole thing was very well organised and even though I didn't get the job in the end, I was happy to have gone through the process. The 4 interviews went well - questions about the product, my background, why I want to work for Facebook, what would I change if I was head of product for a day, how would I explain Facebook to my granny etc.

**************************************Brand and Consumer Marketing Intern**************************************
Got first round interview through campus recruiting, had 2 20-minute interviews, both behavioral, one was more geared towards a case study. Asked typical questions in first interview, such as why "this" university, why "this" major, why Facebook. Second interview consisted of a lot of on-the-spot thinking, providing ideas for solutions to real issues/obstacles Facebook has encountered. Both interviews had stress factor, be at the top of your game if you're…  interviewing for Facebook.

**************************************Project Manager**************************************
Initial interview with recruiter / screener. Second interview with HR. Third and final interview with potential boss. I terminate process after 3rd interview.Have you ever seen 'The Intern' with Robert De Niro? That's how this went.Standard interview questions. Nothing challengingI'm going to go a little off format here. After 15 minutes of questions to me, they asked if I had any questions. I did. And the answers to my questions…  led me to pass on the position.

I didn't interview. I was asked to be reference for a candidate who was about to receive an offer (which given my roles as a senior leader at a consulting organization happens pretty frequently).I received a request to fill out 12 open ended questions, which were more extensive than the recommendation I wrote this person for Business School. It was insane and delivered in by the "University Recruiter" with a…  request to fill it out in less than 24 hours. All that despite the fact that the form was clearly meant for internal use at Facebook.I hope Facebook treats its employees with more respect and empathy than its recruiters treat references.

received call from recruiter who reviewed my resume. Explained her Manager would choose the top 5 candidates for a phone interview with Facebook. I received an email requesting a preference on date and time of Facebook interview. Prior to interview I was given 2 names of Facebook staff that would conduct interview. One did most of the interview, call covered my qualifications and it was over20 min tops.

- phone screen with the recruiter- phone interview with the team member- panel interview on VCMy onsite interview was moved to an earlier date (a week earlier than scheduled) and carried out on VC. Every question was generic and boring. The questions and answers were so boring I found myself demotivated to answer them at all and half way through the first interview I realised that the manager is not…  interested in talking to me and just wanted to tick the box that they interviewed me. All but one interviewers had an attitude "let's get it over with" My impression was that there was already a candidate chosen for the role either internally or externally but for some reason the recruiter decided to waste my time and carry on the 2hr 1:1 interview. Questions ranged from "describe a project you worked on" and "what do you like working on" to "what do you think we do day to day in our department" - as generic as it gets. No business cases or hypothetical scenarios, all past performance and role-specific questions.I've received a rejection email after 12hrs so that only makes me more confident that my application was rejected before I even said hello. I really regret Facebook recruiter decided to waste 2 hrs of my life.

**************************************Technical Compliance Analyst**************************************
First round with HRSecond round with a compliance AnalystSecond round interviewer spent a majority of the time talking about his skillset and his interests barely leaving me any time to answer his questions as well as asking any questions I had about the organization.

**************************************Marketing Manager**************************************
First round interview was very standard and not too difficult. Once you move onto your later rounds, questions can be very technical and difficult. They will ask you for solutions around potential business scenarios to see your though process. You can tell pretty quickly from each interview if you’ll be proceeding to the next round.

I had an hr interview over the phone.it was really simple and typical HR interview.It lasted only 20 mins and questions included tell me about myself, why I'm good at this position, what's my strengh, why I applied to this position etc.she also asked me how i can improve facebook user experience.

**************************************Telecommunications Network Analyst**************************************
Face book will typically have a phone interview and two face-to-face, I hear. However this was for a contracting position.

**************************************Financial/Revenue Analyst**************************************
The recruiter did the phone interview in which I clearly mentioned I wasn't into programming languages and my preference was for a purely FP&A and budgeting type role. She mapped me into the role I was interviewed for.Right from the scheduling of the calls with the hiring manager and the in person interviews, it was a dismal experience. Scheduled calls would start 10-15 minutes after the set time, interviews would…  be cancelled with barely any notice!Once I arrived onsite for a set of 6 interviews (each of which were case interview type questions), no one knew where the interviews were to be held. The order of interviewers changed last minute with no communication and it was clear that they needed someone with a whole lot of technical skills in various programming languages. Needless to say, I left feeling like it was a waste of time and quite frustrated.

**************************************Production Engineer**************************************
Recruiter was very friendly and accommodating. They seemed like they really cared about getting the interview scheduled. First interview was a phone call about 15-20 mins, just a get to know you and see if you're a good fit for the company. After that they schedule the other technical interviews which is about 45 mins and consists of a coding session.

I made it to the 2nd of 4 interviews. Both of my interviewers were extremely polite and professional. The first interview was a phone screening from a recruiter, which also included around 10 Linux sysadmin/networking questions (What command would you use to do _____?). The second interview was a coding test. I was asked to write code to accomplish two different tasks. The interviewer was very helpful in giving me…  suggestions when I would get stuck.

I was shocked by how unprofessional the process was. My recruiter from the beginning was super flaky. They would not call me when they said they would and then call at completely random times catching me off guard. I appreciated that they tried to help me prepare for interviews, though, which they don't really "have" to do. Then, after the on site, they basically told me I had to commit…  to coming to Facebook before I would receive an offer. It basically seemed like the recruiter didn't want to go through the effort of filling out paper work if I wasn't going to come. This was pretty shocking after having spent a month jumping through all the hoops and spending basically a whole day on their campus for interviews. I was already leaning slightly toward another company and that really clinched my decision. Then when I told the recruiter I wasn't going to come they got really aggressive contacting me repeatedly over call/text/email trying to get me to change my mind. Still without giving me anything in writing! I was so shocked that a company with the reputation Facebook had would operate that way.

Got a call for 4 rounds of Interview 1st normal telephonic, 2nd coding challenge, 3rd will be my systems round and I am crossing finger for Menlo Park. In the first telephonic interview asked basic questions on networking and linux to check wether I have strong knowledge in both of those to proceed farther, then there were 2 coding challenges which I believe I did good and currently am looking…  forward for third round.

I was referred by a former colleague, and was immediately contacted by the recruiter, who was extremely nice. He asked 20 basic questions involving coding, networking and systems. Then there were 3 phone interviews, each technical, consisting of coding, systems, and networking.The coding interview was straight forward and it was clear that this was a skill that is necessary, but not as important as the others.The systems interview was where…  I personally had the biggest issue. Not because of the material, but because of the content, and interviewer. The interviewer was the stereotypical Silicon Valley Nerd bully who even warned me before we started that he comes of "a little d*uchey." The moment he said that I knew that the interview was not going to go well. He would not clarify ANY of his questions, he would assume that my sub questions revealed lack of understanding or knowledge. The questions were ridiculous, down to how certain flag options affect the output of certain commands. I understand that a production engineer must know these details, but it is extremely stupid and unrealistic to think that these details cannot be looked up.Long story short, I feel like they didnt even test how much I actually knew about how Linux actually works, just how to look for certain arcane items that vary from distro to distro.Following this disaster, I was informed by the recruiter that they were "not able to offer me the position", as well as "not able to share feedback." Very bitter taste in someones mouth that had been studying and preparing for weeks, sometimes at the expense of my current job, just to be told "no" with zero accountability as to why.Oh wait, but there is more. After a long weekend of sadness and self reflection, I was called again by the recruiter, to say that "they actually want to continue the process to the networking interview, due to the fact that there are many PE teams that deal a lot more with networking than with systems." Naturally, I was ecstatic, seeing as how I am currently in the networking field, and would be able to crush any interview regarding networking.The networking interview came along, which I aced completely. I was contacted the next day, told that they were "not able to offer me the position" and "not able to share feedback"... again. Very weird and ridiculous considering the fact that they called me specifically to test my networking knowledge, only to ask super basic networking questions, have me get them right, then tell me no, and waste yet another week of my time and energy.The Recruiter at facebook was fantastic, the overall experience was not. All of the interviewers were fantastic, except for the systems one. All it takes is one egomaniac that thinks only the worthy should have the chance to work alongside them. Big attractive companies get away with lack of accountability in the interview process, and literally do not care at all about providing legitimate reasons as to why they think you cant do a job that you know you can do.

4 total interviews, Phone, coding, systems, onsite. I made it through the first phone interview and the coding interview, the systems stuff was really what got me, they asked a lot of hard questions and were very serious about making sure their hires knew linux inside and out.

It's very straight forwards, after chatting with HR. There are two rounds phone interview, which are focus on coding and system, respectively. And finally it's the on-site interview. I reached the system interview and failed. The whole process can move forward fast and slow, which depends on the candidate's requirement.

Everyone I interacted with was ridiculously pleasant and loved working there. I never had interest in applying to Facebook but a friend who works there encouraged me and referred me. Everything I read on this website is pretty applicable. 1) Call with recruiter, who asks you 10-12 general Linux questions (I did so-so). 2) Online programming interview (nailed it) 3) Over the phone sysadmin interview (I did poorly)

Possibly the best recruiting I have ever encountered. The feedback and knowing if you passed to the next round literally took them a day or even the same day! The recruiter was so resourceful and really cared. I would get calls to see how I am doing in prepping and basically for each round she would go over what i should focus on. As far as the interview goes, know…  your data structures(not just what they are, but how and when to use them for a given problem, I needed to use it twice in different interviews here). In addition, not sure if it is just for PE's but you basically need to know some sort of scripting(preferably both shell and some other like python,php or perl) I dont think some of the questions will be solved easily with out them. Lastly, for the systems rounds(you will have 2(1 phone and 1 onsite) KNOW your basic troubleshooting tools, linux command line, filesystem(for unix/linux based, like what goes where, knowing this will help for some sort of troubleshooting). Also try to solve questions like what to do when some is wrong type of questions. scoutapp's articles for tools was helpful for knowing some troubleshooting.Recruiter recommended a bunch for the coding, my favorite was leetcode. Careercup is good as well. Plus check more on glassdoor too, it especially helped for the first phone screen.Whatever the end outcome you will learn a lot from the experience. If anything you should be well off for other interviews after having to go through this process. Happy Interviewing:)

first interview was very fast less than 12 minutes. It was very technical. They go straight to the point. Don't even worry about practicing about how to answer : "TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF"just question 1 - 2 -3 .total 10 questions

I passed the first 2 then failed at system level interview, the interviewer is great and the env is very nice. They really set up one good question for people to understand easily at first then hold your back finally. I finally failed that but love to work with them in future.

One interview conducted by a foreigner with some ilegible accent. I had two phone interviews. Lots of questions on Linux administration. Also a coding task on coderpad. Tough for the allow time

I submitted my resume on career fair. The recruiters contacted me after months. They are very nice so don't be shy just ask anything you want to know. I had little experience as being a system administrator, which is the reason I was declined I guess. Also I did not well on coding round although it was not difficult.

Phone screen, then code-over the phone, followed by in person with 6-8 people in 4 interview sessions. The initial phonescreen covers typical techbusiness shibboleths, the coding interview was REALLY fun, and I was excited to do the inperson, but that when everything fell apart.For some reason, facebook has decided that at the inperson interview, you have to write your code on a whiteboard, and it can't have any bugs in…  it. They even tell you to practice coding on a whiteboard before the interview, because apparently, whiteboard coding is a big part of working at facebook. I'll just go ahead and say it, no one writes software longhand, it's not how it's done, and to expect people to write nontrivial things on a whiteboard in 2015 is beyond ridiculous, especially considering that part of facebook's own process is a code interview where you write a program using a computer!If you're interviewing a lumberjack, do you have him draw a chainsaw on a whiteboard?The most important thing to keep in mind if you want to get a job at facebook is that they reinvent everything. Every question they ask will be about how you would reinvent something. I was unprepared for the amount of guessing I was required to do (I'm terrible at guessing.) Remember when you're answering them that they have basically UNLIMITED RESOURCES and are willing to reinvent any wheel. I'm not saying what they're doing is bad, I'm saying it's completely different than anywhere else I've worked in many years in the business, and I think I'd be working there now if I had approached the questions with that in mind, instead of my instinct, which is to leverage the work of others as much as possible to my advantage, eg I look at what's out there on the internet, and then do whatever I need to. If there's something already there, I use that, if not, I'll write my own, or somewhere inbetween -- like everyone not working at facebook does. Don't blow it like I did, remember it's not a normal job, it's facebook, where there are always hackers hacking, and they have more money than Canada to hire more hackers to hack on whatever they've hacked together.The recruiters are nice, the management seemed friendly and capable, lunch wasn't very good but I was probably just stressed out. If you've ever been to the office when it was Sun Microsystems, be ready for a shock, also the cafeteria was like the mall at xmas.I'd love to work there, and on a different day I may have gotten the gig, but at the end of the day, you've still got to make it through a long gauntlet of bored looking engineers, looking to exclude you.They have unique problems there and it would be a super cool job, so I hope this helps someone else. As for me, I'll never go through it again.

Quick tech quiz with the recruiter over the phone. Then we scheduled two phone screens, one on coding, one on systems, both of them 1 hour long. Once you pass the phone screens you'll have to schedule an on-site visit which consists of 5 interviews, 45 minutes each: systems, networking, cultural, system architecture, coding. If you're not from CA, they'll fly you over to SFO, preferably on a Monday.

Got a phone screening, followed by two phone interviews. The entire process went quicker than I thought. The interviews were difficult but fair. I definitely prepared a lot beforehand (brushing up on knowledge of Linux, systems, networking, etc).I got an offer without doing an onsite, which I don't think is typical for Facebook.

They recruited me at a conference. I had a recruiter phone screen followed by two engineering phone screens. One was focused on coding and the other on systems. This was followed by an all-day interview at the Facebook Campus. The all-day interview was 5 sessions with different engineers, 45 minutes each. Each interview focused on a different area like Architecture, Coding, Networking, and Systems.

An recruiter contacted me by email and ask me to do a phone interview. She asked me whether I am familiar with production engineer's work and 10+ initial screen questions. They are all about basic Linux and networking knowledge, like port number and tcp protocol, Linux commands. Most of them are quite easy but they do really have some tricky questions. Afterward, I was told that I had passed and…  would have one coding interview and one system interview before making the final decision.The coding interview started about 1 weeks later. I was asked to code using stypi and there are two questions in 45 minutes. One is translate English to "Goat Latin" language with a set of predefined rules. It was not hard but I still spent 20-30 minutes on that, partly because I cared too much about the detail. The second question is more a shell-script coding, although I did not realize it immediately. I was asked to obfuscate local parts of email addresses found in all HTML files under a folder (also subfolders). Due to the time limit, I did not write a clean and complete code for it. But I discussed with the interviewers for the possible solutions (shell script + python regex operation).Then the recruiter told me I passes the first round and we moved on to system interview, which began 5 days later. Since it is totally new to me, I read lots of posts in glassdoor and other interviewing forums and there are very useful. The interview questions requires solid knowledge about Linux, operating system, performance monitoring. They both starts with a relatively simple questions but ends with lots of followup questions. Try your best to be open-minded and always talk with the interviewer. They want not only an correct answer, but also how you get this solution.Later that day I heard from the recruiter that the feedback seemed also great. After one week, they give me the offer. The salary is greater than I ever expected.Pros:   The recruiter is super nice and willing to answer any of your question in a timely manner.   The interviewing schedule is very flexible. You can propose any date as you like.   The interviewers are quite smart and patient. They are always on your side and trying to guide you through difficulties.

I was contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn. He asked several simple questions and then set up two phone screens, one for "systems" and one for "software engineering." A few days later I was invited to Menlo Park, CA for a day of interviews. There were 5 45-minute sessions: software engineering, networking, manager, and design. The interviewers varied in quality, but we generally pretty good.

First interview was with a HR, which i thought would be just about soft skills but i was asked 10-20 technical question mostly networking and system administration. Second round was a coding exercise and was asked to code using any language of my choice. Interviewer is looking for how you apply the logic. He did not ran my code but he made some modifications on the code and asked me…  what the output will be after the changes.

The recruiter contacted me on Linkedin and during our initial exploratory conversation, I was asked several initial screening questions about my background. Afterward, I was scheduled for a 45-minute coding interview, about one week later.The interviewer contacted me at the proper time and we began the interview, using stypi.com. The first question came and went very quickly, though I did have some difficulty understanding the interviewer as English was not…  their first language. The second question also went by very quickly, though the interviewer kept hitting on what happens when a float is cast to/from a boolean in Python and ultimately, I suspect this is what put the interviewer against me.Overall, the questions asked were fair and weren’t unnecessarily complicated.The time from the phone screen to rejection was six days and the rejection message was the standard condescending boilerplate of, "We've found stronger candidates for this particular position," leaving me with no idea what I had done wrong and only my suspicions. Followup e-mails to figure out where I fell short were met with silence.The job posting had the following verbiage on it; "Our team is comprised of varying levels of experience and backgrounds, from new grads to industry veterans. Relevant industry experience is important, but ultimately less so than your demonstrated abilities and attitude. We sail into uncharted waters every day at Facebook in Production Engineering, and we are always learning."For a position that demands such a broad range of skills, I find it silly that what (I suspect, anyway) did me in was something that in a real-world situation, I could've just opened an interactive Python interpreter and entered a few of lines to prove / disprove the expected behavior. So much for "we are always learning."Pros:- Recruiter was friendly and was on top of things.- Decision was made quickly.- Interview questions were fair.Cons:- Interviewer dinged me for trivial things.- Coding interview did not reflect the broad knowledge required for the role.- Interview did not jive with the ethos of, "we are always learning."- I had some trouble understanding the interviewer and I suspect they also had trouble understanding me.- Standard condescending rejection boilerplate with followup e-mails routed to /dev/null.

A recruiter reached out to discuss a position thatmay be a good fit with my skillset. It started with aphone interview followed up with a code review interview.The process took about 10 days.The interview questions were not difficult, some withseveral answers. Unix Process, networking, tcp/ip stack,and system administrative commands.The process was casual, I did notice before the interviewseven started. Their coordination was awkward, after receivingnumerous misspelled emails and wrong phone…  numbers. I was alittle leery of working for them. Nonetheless, I continuedwith the 45-min code review interview and answered the question.Overall, the interviews were comparable to other companies. Also,they were efficient with their responses and answering questions.

Over the phone coding screen, I was asked two fairly easy questions and I answered both of the them well and I understood the edge cases and answered all the questions the interview had about my solutions. The interview lasted about 50 minutes.Sadly I was rejected based on feedback from the interviewer. The feedback stated the second question was fine, but the first question had an issue. The solution I…  provided wasn't what the interviewer wanted, and the solution that he wanted was different from what the question had asked.

Referred by a friend and received email from the recruiter several weeks later. The recruiter would ask some one-word-answer questions just to make sure you have the most basic knowledge required for this position. They are mostly linux system related questions and if you work with linux it should be easy. There are two telephone technical interviews after that. First is for coding and the seconds is for linux system…  knowledge.

A recruiter contacted me. After confirming that I would like to interview for the position, I was asked basic questions around networking, Linux system administration, and programming. A graduating Computer Science student should expect to pass this with little difficulty.Next was a phone interview for programming. I was asked to take input text and identify the unique words in the text and how many times each word occurred. Edge cases…  were important as was the performance. Interviewer asked for an analysis of the run-time and memory usage. Any second-year CS student should have no problem completing this in far less than the allocated time.Next was a phone interview for systems administration. I was given the bare minimum information possible about a system and told to describe how I discover running services and potential issues. As I progressed, the interviewer gave me information reasonable based on my descriptions and identified when I had correctly discovered a problem or possible problem. In investigating problems, it was important to be specific about why the problem was occurring and how to address the issue. When addressing problems, the performance, scalability, and maintainability of the solution was very important. Be prepared to identify how a file system is mounted or if it's local, and be prepared to encounter a single central share mounted by many servers with active read/write activity from them all. This will be difficult for anyone without good real-world Linux systems administration experience.Next I was flown out to HQ for a series of on-site interviews. A manager spoke to me to gauge my understanding of Facebook and the Production Engineering position (rely on the job description and don't be afraid to ask your recruiter lots of questions!) and to get to know me.There's another interview about coding and another one for systems administration. Both are along the same lines as the phone interview, but more in-depth and more difficult.There's a systems design interview, where you'll be given a target and asked to design a scalable and performant system to accomplish the goal. You may be asked to analyze the storage requirements (core and/or persistent) and network requirements of your system.The last interview type is a networking interview, which is very in-depth and requires extensive knowledge of TCP/IP, UDP/IP, DNS, etc. Essentially, start at a command prompt and think of what happens when you type "telnet www.facebook.com 80" - be prepared to talk about almost every single network-related thing that happens at all seven OSI layers. Know your packet layouts!Throughout the entire process, my recruiter was always on top of keeping me informed and always answered questions very quickly (I rarely waited even most of a day for a reply). I rarely needed to ask anything about what to expect because she kept me so well informed. Don't worry too much about thinking at Facebook's scale, they understand that very few people have worked on anything even approaching their size and scale. Everyone you deal with will work hard to make things go as smoothly as it can.

Was contacted by a recruiter. The recruiter initially asked me a handful of one-word-answer system administration questions. Subsequently had three phone screening interviews spaced over a couple of weeks before being invited to fly out to SF for an on-site interview.The screening interviews were straightforward 45-minute phone calls using an shared text editor site to code.The on-site interview was a full day consisting of 4 seperate interviews on different topics.…  The engineers I interacted with were all very friendly, and the questions asked were at times difficult but very fair: everything I was asked seemed very relevant to the potential job and assessing my general programming skill (no "stupid hard for the sake of being stupid hard" sort of questions).The campus is fantastic, and I got to spend a lot of time with the recruiter, who was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, asking questions and wondering around checking the place out. The trip would have been worth the time even if I didn't get an offer.About a week after my on-site interview, I got a call from the recruiter saying they wanted to offer me the position. The next day we discussed the compensation details, and a few days later I accepted.

Contacted on linkedin based on Google experience. Fairly long interview process, with a phone screen, then two technical phone interviews, then a full day interview in Menlo Park. Took several weeks for them to get back, too, but they came up with a very competitive offer, and came back fairly quickly when I countered.

Was initially contacted via LinkedIn by an internal Facebook recruiter that dealt specifically with this role. I was impressed with the recruiter's technical knowledge, always a good sign, and agreed to go through the screening and start the interview process.The process is 5 steps:* Call with recruiter about position* Phone screening with a few trivia questions regarding systems administration.* Co-operative coding phone interview* Systems phone interview* On-Site interviewThe call with…  the recruiter was mostly about the position description and duties, and assessing whether both sides think it's a good fit. The phone screening, also done with the recruiter, is just a few questions that anyone who has administered Linux for an organization would be able to answer off the top of their head.The coding interview was done using a collaborative editing tool, so both parties could see what was being typed. The coding questions were not your typical abstract data manipulation questions, but rather questions that required systems knowledge, and in my case were most easily answered with shell scripts.I didn't actually do the systems phone interview, as they considered my programming interview strong enough to simply skip this step. I'm informed this is not uncommon.The on-site interview loop included five 45-minute segments: Programming, Systems, Networking, Solution Architecture, and meeting with the Manager (not in that order). Additionally, lunch with the initial recruiter and a brief chat afterwards with a different recruiter that dealt with the financial and logistics portions of the interview and negotiations.One thing that struck me during the entire process is that *everyone* I spoke to, and I mean *everyone* because I asked them all, absolutely loved working there. Every time I asked someone how they liked working at Facebook, their face lit up and they started listing off reasons they loved working there, and everyone had the same reason: They liked everyone around them, felt trusted and respected, and trusted and respected the people around them. This was unanimously the first reason, usually followed by "and the work is really interesting".

I was contacted by a recruiter on Linkedin.I first had a really quick phone call + technical screening with the recruiter (port numbers, shell commands...).After that was a 2 questions coding interview over the phone which I believed didn't go so well even though the questions were easy (Think first CS college course level), but I passed anyway.Next I had a another technical phone call on systems (kernel, shell commands,…  basictroubleshooting...)I was then invited to fly over to California for an on-site interview which I was really excited about. I stayed in a pretty nice hotel and everything was paid for by FB.On-site, I had 5+ interviews with engineer, managers and recruiters which were similar to the phone interviews, just a little deeper/harder.I also had the opportunity to tour the FB campus which looked great... nice office space, lots of free perks, great people...I had an offer about a week later and accepted. You don't ofter get to work for one of the biggest/greatest/most traffic website/platform...

HR contacted me from Linkedin.There was 3 phone interviews for screening, code test and system administration test.First interview, recruiter went through some questions, such as port number, routing, Linux commands, and some basic language wise questions.Second interview was a coding test. Engineer had me to write two script for csv data processing, and system monitoring.Third one was for system administration. The questions were pretty open. The interviewer had me to…  dig into the internals of operating system, such as performance tuning, memory model, paging, swap, process forking, system call, interrupt, and etc.I passed 3 interviews, and flew to Facebook campus for a whole day onsite interview (with NDA signed).During the interview process, I felt people there are super nice, and gave me chances to answer questions correctly.My suggestions - Use your strongest language (scripting language will help a lot) - Familiar with operating system internals and system analysis tools - Familiar with networks and infrastructures (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, and etc) - Think about scalability

Recruiter contacted me through LinkedIn and we setup a phone interview. He went through some basic System Administration questions and at the end asked me for availability for a coding interview. Coding interview was about algorithm and solving three problems.

Everyone I spoke with was reasonably personable and competent. The process went quite smoothly and was relatively painless.5 phone contacts:* basic screening (might you be a good fit for the position)* basic programming* (single) system administration* basic description of what will come next+handoff to another recruiter* in-depth description with new recruiter of what to expect during the on-site interviews5 onsite interviews+lunch:You first meet your recruiter, with a brief overview of…  the day.* Production Engineer Manager  - Getting to know you, talk about what a Production Engineer does.* Coding  - Algorithmically simple (write ____ system utility), but you need to be able to intelligently discuss complexity and tradeoffs of optimizations (CPU/RAM). What is the theoretical best performance?  - You don't need to know exact details of APIs, but you need to know what calls are available, and have a deep understanding of how things work. You should know exactly what is happening, including the complexity of any system calls you make.  - Accuracy and and efficiency in your code are crucial.* Systems  - FB has problems on a scale you have not yet realized. They hit problems you haven't ever seen.  - When you see ____ crazy problem, what do you do? How do you figure out what the fundamental problem is? Once you know the problem, how can you mitigate it?  - Explain in detail what happens when you run ____ command.  - Think about this sort of information: what problems are you going to run into while doing IPC (pipes, shared memory structures etc.)? How exactly does the OS transfer information across a pipe? What are the limits or bottlenecks?* LUNCH  - Good food, relax and get to know your recruiter a little better. Get a better feel for the environment. Ask questions off the record, so to speak.* Design/Architecture  - FB understands you probably don't have experience at their scale. Just do your best to extend what you know to their scale.  - How do you do ____ across a large number of systems? How do you do it without interrupting production? How long will it take?  - When doing estimation, be sure to explain your thought processes.* Networking  - Probably the least important of the 4 technical interviews.  - Be familiar with packet routing (How does the source computer know where to route packets? How do packets move across a network?).  - Know how to configure and use at least one client/server network service (and talk about it intelligently). How does it work internally? What are the features of XXX protocol?Last, you talk to your recruiter about what you think about the recruiting process, the position, how well it fits you, considerations that you may need to think about before making a final decision.

Three 45-minute phone interviews. A positive review from each qualified me for the next.First interview was a basic-technical one with their recruiter: port numbers, subnet math, Linux commands.Second was a Collabedit programming interview. An engineer had me build a performance monitoring script, adding more features and improving efficiency as we went.Third was a systems interview. Heavy operating systems theory was involved. This engineer's confessed style was improvisational, probing areas of…  knowledge my previous answers had laid claim to. It helped to know enough systems stuff, and to be interested enough in it, to make the conversation span the whole interview time.I passed the third phone interview, so Facebook flew me to their campus for a day of on-site interviews. I had to sign an NDA covering my experiences on that day. What I can say is that I thought it went at least as well as my phone interviews, yet I got a rejection email a week later.

The process was pretty spread-out but extremely well coordinated and communicated. Expectations were perfectly managed. Since I was remote, they had me go through a set of 3 phone screenings, each very technical. Passing each phone screen lead to the next, with passing the final round leading to an in-person interview and trip to Menlo Park, CA.The pictures of the campus there don't do it justice. It's a really surprising…  environment.I really can't say enough how awesome their recruiting staff is. They always replied promptly and helpfully, and were awesome to work around my schedule every step along the way.In the final analysis I just wasn't a good fit for the position - and I even agree with them. After seeing and hearing so much of the cool stuff they do behind the scenes and are working on doing, I am not (yet) qualified for that job. In the end, the thing I felt most qualified in was my big stumble. What I learned was to be on their level, it wasn't enough to have just done what I've done for a long time - that they justifiably want an expert in multiple disciplines.Their benefits are just absurdly great. Everything they offer is top-notch including their facility in Menlo Park, where the old Sun research campus used to be.In the end, it was a great experience. I got to go and interview with one of the biggest Internet companies in the world and meet some brilliant people and see just how great their environment is. I realized that in the right environment, I can go head to head with some of the best - and got a quick trip out there to boot!

I was contacted by a recruiter over linkedin. After doing a technical screen with the recruiter, there were two phone interviews with engineers. The first was a fairly simple programming test, and later a more in depth systems test.

Recruiters were very eager and helpful, the process was still being worked out especially on the international and immigration front, but the actual interview was well ran. The questions were somewhat hard, especially since they assumed a different approach to e.g. software development.

The process was tough but fair. The phone screens were a bit harrowing because I didn't know what to expect. However, during the on site, the employees did everything they could to make me as comfortable as possible and gave me every opportunity to answer the questions correctly.

Actually I do not have any interview but Glassdoor ask me to add one to unlock the context on this website. The HR just asked me the question on email.

The whole process included two phone screens and a five-interview onsite - all 45 mins.The first phone screen was all about coding - two problems to solve on a coderpad shared document.The second, conversely, was unix systems internal. The interviewer asked about a project from my resume and we delved into the systems part from there.The onsite was composed by five interviews:- Systems Design: how to design a very abstract…  system. The problem start very broad and generic (e.g. - design a pubsub system) and it needs to be straightened down to details during the interviews (storage & bandwidth calculation; distributed consensus and network partition tolerance; ddos and bot protection and mitigation).- Coding: similar to the first phone screen;- Systems: again, similar to the second phone screen - also including systems troubleshooting (e.g.: You receive a report that a system is unresponsive, what do you do?)- Network: similar to systems design, but on network stacks knowledge (e.g.: what's the first packet that your laptop sends out when it boots?)- Soft skills: SBI questions about your past work experience.Overall the interview was average difficulty and fun to perform.

Impressed interview process we making with recruiter! Recruiter friendly, positive, and had the process down to an art.The technical interviews have a two section, about the linux and programming. I do my best about the linux and kernel questions. They asked me some process states, kernel, kernel modules etc. But the programming interview maybe too focused computer science students :) They asked me some algorithms, I failed about the Big-O-Notations…  :)

I was approached by recruiter. There's a phone interview with general discussion (introduction, goals, why, etc.) of about 20-30 minutes followed by a short list of entry level technical questions (how many addresses are in a /27 network, what command you use for updating initrd, which file you modify for service X, etc).After that there was a second phone interview which lasted 40-45 minutes and was focused on coding (questions…  below).They're not hard but require focus and combination of different skills.

First, there was a phone screen. I was asked the usual stuff about my experience and plans. The phone screen included some basic Linux and networks related questions.The next phone interview was about coding without compilation. It was mostly about text manipulation methods.The last phone interview was about Linux and networks.

I was contacted via email from my linkedin profile. A call was arranged and they asked a number of technical questions. The first section on systems was the most difficult for me as I didn't understand the question context well. Networking went better and the signals section was in between. They suggested that we move forward with the second interview in the series.

Got mail from a Facebook recruiter, arrange quick phone screen to answer a few questions about me and general questions on topics the position requires. After that arrange first a 50 min coding interview over the phone (solved a single problem strings problem). Then got a 50 min systems interview over the phone this interview got me cold I thought it was more of a general sysadmin stuff but its…  goes very expecific on how linux manages processes, memory, etc. I fail the last one and process ended there.Overall was a good learning experience, and everyone was polite and professional.

I had 3 interviews over the span of a couple weeks. Did not make it to the final on location in person interview.1st Interview consisted of a phone call with recruiter. Recruiter described position and requirements and asked for my qualifications. Essentially the position requires candidates to move to California or Seattle, involves software and hardware competencies and include on call rotation.2nd Interview consisted of a phone call with software…  developer manager. I was asked for in detail software development background and projects involved with. On line programming test consisted of one string manipulation question.3rd Interview consisted of a phone call with infrastructure engineering manager. I was asked in depth questions concerning many software and hardware platforms.

Was found by a recruiter on LinkedIn. Had a phone interviewer with the recruiter and she gave me an overview of the company and the position including role's environment. After a 20 minute conversation asked if I had time for a 25 minute technical interview. Afterwards she asked me to submit my resume and the hiring manager would make a decision if I would go onto the next step of…  a comprehensive phone interview. Recruiter replied by email the following week that I did not make the cut.

Several phone interviews which were quite technical and enjoyable. After the fourth call I got invited to the Dublin Facebook office which quite frankly looks dated and not as inspiring as you would hope. I was being interviewed for a role in San Francisco so I did not really mind.The 5 "1 on 1" interviews went pretty fast but can be somewhat exhausting. Attitude ranged from very friendly to somewhat…  hostile.

First I had a call with the recruiter, then two technical phone interviews. Then I had to go to Dublin and I had 5 interviews in one day. One technical and the other ones were to test your personality, presentation skills, etc.

I applied online for a production engineering position. A recruiter did a screening interview with me to assess where my strengths lay, and to determine which role would be the best fit. They recommended a production engineering role. We scheduled a phone interview which covered several programming/scripting questions. After getting positive feedback, we scheduled another phone interview which covered linux system administration and troubleshooting. Although I received positive feedback from…  that interview as well, the existing production engineering roles were filled. My recruiter asked if I would be interested in pursuing another role within the organization, specifically a software engineering role. We scheduled an interview with that team. I had a bad day, and couldn't focus during the interview, totally blowing it. I didn't receive an offer, although if given another chance I believe I would be offered one.

It starts with the screening call. Here I was asked a little about what I currently do, and then some general questions: ports, subnet math, linux commands, TCP. I got most of the right, so I was qualified to begin the proper interviews. I found out there were going to be two 45 minute phone interviews and if I passed both, I will be brought on site in their Menlo…  Park location for some more interviews.The first is a programming interview, in the language of your choice, using collabedit. You'll be asked to write a function and a small program that do different things. They will not actually run the code, but rather speak with you about what you've written down. The tasks were pretty basic, so I assume they also follow your general attitude towards the problems and how you structure everything and present what you are doing.The interviewer is not allowed to give direct feedback but you'll probably know if he's got a good feeling or not. After about a week I got an email telling me that I've passed and I scheduled my second phone interview. The second phone interview is a linux systems administration interview, also using (when needed) collabedit. This is a pretty thorough interview and the questions go as deep as the linux kernel. You'll have to know how things like how the bash interpreter works, process forking and killing, memory management, process tracing and debugging.My systems administration knowledge is not that deep so this interview did not go as well.

A chat with a junior and a senior recruiter to establish basic credentials and desire to work for Facebook. One out of a possible two telephone coding interviews followed by a day of face to face interviews on-site. The on-site interviews spanned cultural fit, architecture, systems, coding and networking knowledge - each given a single interview. Lunch was included and delicious!

Very polite and friendly people. Process took several weeks. Recruiter contacted me via LinkedIn. First screening interview with some technical questions. Next two were with technical people: scripting skills and infrastructure maintenance. Not so difficult questions but a little tricky.

**************************************Marketing Executive**************************************
At first they emailed me and asked me to do the online test.The online test was testing about my analytical skill and problem solving. After the test,I have scheduled a phone interview.It was decent interview, It wasn't very hard and preparation is the key.

**************************************Product Manager**************************************
Went through a friend's referral. From the point of referral to getting a sourcer assigned took almost 3 weeks. I guess it's because PM jobs in FB are too hot.After agreeing the date/time for initial call with the sourcer, the sourcer missed the call. So had to re-schedule. The sourcer then missed the second time. I had to ask my friend to ping HR to find out what's going on,…  and get the sourcer to call me.After finally getting the initial call with the sourcer, we scheduled first two phone interviews. No prep material was sent to me. One is on Execution, and the other on Product Sense.On the day of the interview, where the first was about Product Sense, but the questions being asked was around Execution more. Later, the sourcer told me that the first interviewer thought that she was interviewing Execution and gave me Execution questions. The second interviewer, who was originally setup to interview Execution couldn't switch to interview Product Sense, and therefore the 2nd interview had to be re-scheduled.The coordination of FB's recruiting team is a complete mess, and there's no follow-up afterwards. I kind of gave up from my side too given what happened and would rather focus on my current job.

There were 3 stages to the interview process:=====1) Recruiter interview:A great chat with a recruiter / sourcer who explained to me how the process would go and the kind of questions I should expect. Throughout the process the sourcer and the recruiter were extremely helpful in explaining what was next and what to expect.=====2) Video interview:A product sense and an execution interview. Both interviewers were very courteous.Execution #1 - The…  interviewer focusing on execution explained she would be interrupting me but that this wasn't something they usually did at Facebook. It's such a small thing but helped me be more relaxed about our interaction. I came out of the interview thinking I didn't do too well but received feedback after the fact from the recruiter that I had done well.Product Sense #1 - The interviewer who focused on product sense nodded and smiled from time to time. It was difficult for me to understand whether I had performed or not.=====3) On-site interview:I was in the interview process with other firms but coming on-site and meeting other product managers made it clear to me this was a great place to build product. Every PM who interviewed me with was sharp and interesting and I felt I had "permission to not hold back" which helped me give be clearer in my thinking and presentation.Execution #2 - We dived into Facebook live. The interviewer asked tangential questions to test both big picture thinking, goal-driven and detail focused execution.Product Sense #2 - This was such a fun interview. Letting go and thinking big and different is important (and fun) but it's also crucial to stick to a structure and go back to it.Leadership & Drive - The interview was a (great) conversation but I found it useful to present things in a structured way as it made it easier for my interviewer to follow.=====ADVICE:- Preparation books are useful but counter-productive after a first read and a pass on the exercises.- Use the books to create your own structure.- You've done the job and you know how to do it, now you just need to gather and organise your thoughts.- Blog about it as a way to reward yourself for the thinking process!

I interviewed with Facebook in Feb'15. I first had a brief screening with a recruiter, followed by two phone interviews, each 45 minutes long and then an onsite with 3 back to back interviews each 45 min long.I had applied to FB directly and got a call from the recruiter. The recruiter was super helpful throughout each step of the process. In the initial call, he asked me basic questions…  about my previous job and why I wanted to join Facebook.Phone Interviews:As many have already mentioned, FB PM interviews fall into 3 categories: 1. Product Design (PD), 2. Product Sense (PS) and 3. Leadership&Drive (LD) interviews.My first phone interview was PD interview where the interviewer stated by asking which feature I was most proud of. Then he followed up with how would you improve that feature. Then he asked me how would I design FB for blind people. Lastly, he invited me to ask few questions of him.My second phone interview was PS. Here FB is trying to get a sense of how good you are at understanding metrics and making tradeoffs amongst different metrics. My first question was if you are the PM for FB Pages, then how would you decide what goals and roadmap to have 1 year out. Then the interviewer asked me how would I do it for 50 years out. He also asked me to go into some detail of why I chose the metrics that I chose and how would I improve them (roadmap part). Next, he asked me the following question: Let us say you are sitting with a mobile analyst whom you can ask any question. You are looking at DAU data across the world and notice that there has been a jump of 5% compared to yesterday in Indonesia. What would you ask the analyst? Lastly, I was given 15 min to ask questions.This interview lasted almost 70 min though it was supposed to be for 45 min.Both interviewers guided me / gave me hints when I got stuck or asked relevant questions for solving the problems given to me.After the phone interview, recruiter called up after 3-4 days to let me know that I have moved to onsite round. He also gave me feedback on what I did well on and what needed improvement to succeed in next round. This was super helpful as I focused my energies on addressing the areas for improvement.Onsite Interview:I had 3 onsite interviews, each 45 min long, starting at 10am. In each of the interviews, there was a shadow interviewer too, so in all, I met 6 people during the interviews. Shadow interviewers decision/vote does not count in the hiring process, I was told.First was PD, followed by LD and lastly PS.PD: What app FB should build next? How would you improve a FB app of your choice. I had a really good discussion with PM on all the questions.PS: I do not remember the details of this interview except that I did not do it so well.LD: This was behavioural interview with examples from my previous job. Here they are looking for how self aware you are, what is your leadership style, how do you handle failures and how good are you at accepting mistakes.After the interviews were over, another FB PM took me to lunch (while my interviewers met to discuss if they needed a 4th interview). Recruiter had told me that sometimes when they want to dig deeper into anything, they might schedule a 4th interview. The PM who took me to lunch had 4 interviews. Thankfully, I did not have 4th interview.All the interviewers were very courteous, down to earth and I had a very pleasant experience.Recruiter call me about 5 days later to let me know that I had the offer. He also gave me feedback on what went well and what didnt (PS).Focus on following:1. Tie everything back to FB's vision.2. Always start with goal and user personas, followed by defining needs/pain points and then feature design.3. I practiced/'solved' all the questions listed on glassdoor FB PM interviews, which helped me immensely. While almost all questions were new, but the pattern was same. The more you practice the questions the better you become at thinking on your feet during the interview and following the PM thought process without much stumbling.

The process was well organized and structured. It took a very long time to schedule interviews, but after scheduling them, hearing feedback on moving onto the next round was very quick (within a day every time). They give you information regarding who your interviewers are, what you will be asked, and what to expect in advance so it is very easy for you to prepare and do well during the…  interviews. I had two video call interviews and three onsite interviews on product sense, execution, and leadership. Product sense relates to questions on product design and development, execution is a lot of analysis and metrics related questions, and leadership is your standard behavioral interview.

45' phone screen, and five 30-45' onsite interviews. Onsite interviews consisted of three focused skills interviews on key areas (Product Sense, etc) plus 2 cross-functional interviews with Marketing and Engineering leads.Interviews focused mainly on a case or problem that the interviewer presented, usually with five minutes at the end for questions for the interviewer.

Interviewed for a senior PM role by a PMs with less than 3 years of experience. They clearly had an issue with my experience and ago. Facebook not only has the worse diversity numbers in Silicon Valley, but is also ground zero for age discrimination. They need to seriously revamp their interview training to take unintended bias into consideration. If they tell you they need people who are more hands…  on in their "operating environment" then that is code language for you are too old. Or, you're just older than the people interviewing. Zuck once said, "Young people are just smarter," and it is clear nothing has changed. If you are 35+ then your chances are slim regardless of your education, where you've worked, or your qualifications. If you are over 40, then don't bother.Surprised they haven't been sued for discrimination by now.

Overall process was organized, efficient, and challenging. I was applying for a specialist role but still went through the generalist process. Appreciated meeting PMs from different parts of the org but as a result didn't get a chance to really know the team that I wanted to join. Required two visits to the campus but everything was wrapped up within a two week time frame. Interviewers were all on time,…  well prepared, friendly, and open.

Phone interview with a recruiter, then two in-person interviews to assess "product instincts" and "execution." One interviewer was rude and kept interrupting me as he was questioning me, then when I asked him about how Facebook handles complex cross-functional projects, looked like he was ready to cry. "It's total chaos," he told me.The other interviewer was totally disengaged, and, although I had been guided to treat the interview as a…  "brainstorming session," she simply wouldn't give me any back-and-forth. I asked questions, she refused to answer. I tried to clarify points, she simply said, "what do you think?" I came away convinced that the interview is focused on testing candidates who have very little real-world experience, and therefore can't give examples of real situations in which they've had to use their product instincts or execute under tough conditions. Consequently, the questions focus on hypotheticals that don't provide an accurate picture of a candidate's skills, and, in fact, provide a warped picture of an experienced candidate who is accustomed to working with facts and real situations.I know that Facebook thinks they're very "data driven" about this hiring process, but I think they've headed down the wrong path for more senior PM candidates (I have 15 years of product management experience).After the interview, I didn't receive any call back from the recruiter. I didn't pursue it, because the negative experience I had led me to conclude that I don't want to work there. But, the lack of follow-up isn't a particularly good sign either.

Have been recommended twice by former co-workers/current employees. Passed the phone screens 4 times with 4 different HR people only to have the hiring manager not want to do the phone interview with me. I'm 40+ so and it feels like I haven't made it further because the hiring managers are uncomfortable working with people older and/or more experienced than them. I'm in tech, haven't had a boss older than…  me since I was in my 20s, it doesn't bother me. And, if they met me and didn't want to hire me I could understand that too. Not being able to get an interview is a real problem.The HR people were very nice and efficient.

I was contacted by a recruiter. Did a phone screen with the re recruiter, followed by a 45 minute Product Sense and 45 minute Product Execution Interview. My recruiter helped me prep for the interview beforehand.The questions are very open ended and ambiguous. Ask a lot of clarifying questions and break down a big problem in a structured way. I had a lot of back and forth dialog with my…  interviewers.I didn't make it but it wasn't for want of preparing or of any unfairness on the part of my interviewers.

I was contacted via a recruiter who found me on LinkedIn. I interviewed for a specialized Product Manager role in the Menlo Park office, but since I do not live on the West Coast my interviews were all via videoconference and phone.I had 1 screening call with the recruiter, then 3 videoconference interviews: 1 with the hiring manager, 1 product execution interview (2 questions), and 1 product sense interview (2…  questions). The interviews were generally pleasant and moved fast (all 45 min each except for the 30 min initial screen). I advanced between each of the 3 videoconference rounds and was given the notification of the advancement by my recruiter in between each -- it usually took 1 week to set up each subsequent interview.The screening with the recruiter was a review of my background and the position.The interview with the hiring manager was a deeper review of my background, then questions about my strengths and weaknesses as a product lead. Then we spoke about the team I would be joining and the role itself.Next was the product execution interview. I especially enjoyed the product execution interview because the interviewer was someone known in the tech space and a very strong interviewer -- he was very helpful in guiding the discussion, and I left thinking that he was someone I would absolutely love to work with. The questions he asked were centered around prioritizing how users are presented with modules and products on the FB app (particularly People You May Know vs an ad, and a new local search product).Next was the product sense interview. My final interviewer was weaker as an interviewer -- he did not provide as much guidance during the discussion and seemed more junior than my previous interviewers. He first asked me to pick a product I want to work on at FB and what I would do to improve it. Then, he asked an off-the-cuff question about my current industry during the product sense interview, which I believe to be was what led me not to move forward in the hiring process -- I made the big mistake of taking the question literally and went down the wrong path of providing a high level business strategy from the point of view of the business rather than a product strategy from the point of view of the user.After this interview my recruiter infomed me that they would not move forward.I was disappointed after getting this far into the interview process to have it end at this point-- I believe I could have advanced to the final round (it was my next step in the process), but it was definitely my mistake for not keeping the scope of my answer from a product standpoint in my last interview.

The last minute the onsite was cancelled, and the HR said the headcount was frozen and they will reopen it after several months. Then after the said time span I ping-ed the HR twice and he didn't response. End of the story. I don't know why they didn't response to my mails now, since I already passed 2 phone interviews and gained onsite entrance.

I thought the questions asked were fair. I liked how you got 2 interviews and that it wasn't just based on 1 person's assessment. The interviewers were very nice and patient. It wasn't just 1 or 2 questions, I felt like there were many that somehow all related to one another. I was supposed to get 2 different types of interviews, but in all honesty, it felt like they were…  both the same - the focus is on product, of course, and knowing the data to support your decisions.

This was for the Rotational Product Manager Position:I applied through a company referral which really helps your application if you can get someone. Also Facebook employees who refer a new hire are compensated if you end up getting the job ($5000 for RPMs). So reach out to friends you have who work here.For RPMs Facebook is looking for how you think about problems. Most RPM hires are right out of…  college and don't have any product management experience so don't feel overwhelmed. You just need to very clearly communicate how you break down problems and why you are a good fit for Facebook's mission.Facebook recruiters are very clear beforehand about the questions to allow you to prepare. Use this time to prepare! They expect very specific personal experiences which is why they let you in early on what questions will be asked. You won't be surprised by questions in any of the interviews if you have already thought through what you want to communicate.Phone Interviews:1. Product Sense - Talked about an app that I like and design decisions I thought made the app special. Also was asked about one of my side projects and explained a design decision I made. I would stress in this interview that you are empathetic about user needs. That seems to be what they are looking for2. Execution - Was asked a bunch of hypothetical questions "How would you double group joins in 3mo if we gave you a team of 5 engineers." Stress here that you are data driven, use cohort analysis and break users up to prioritize different strategies.On Campus Interviews:(These interview orders vary by candidate so the exact order may be different)1. Execution - You will be asked how you get things done when you don't have ample resources. You'll be asked to solve a problem you don't understand. Hint: Ask clarifying questions! Show that you are a doer and understand how to prioritize multiple approaches.2. Leadership - What they really want to see here is how you interact with people. You should talk about a time when you inspired a group to do something. You should think through how you would handle all types of conflicts.3. Product Sense - This interview has the most variation across candidates. You will definitely be asked about a product you like similar to your phone interview. Beyond that the interviewer might ask you anything from a hypothetical feature question to a very specific design scenario they ended up in through their position. Try to stress here that you are empathetic toward users, and aren't afraid to admit when you don't know something.

Very fast on the overall processRecruiter chat on phone followed by phone interviews each lasting 45 min to 1 hourResult provide in the next 1-3 daysHard to know what angle the interviewer is looking for : strategy or execution so better to ask questionsThey like quick offbeat thinkingKnowledge of product design is good

Got a referral through an employee and got a screen with a recruiter. After a conversation, was invited for the first onsite as a local hire. Recruiter prepared me for structure, which tests for product sense and execution.The day of, I got 2 pairs of interviewers back to back, with 1 shadowing each main interviewer. Some questions below. I was surprised by the amount of behavioral questions that I minimized…  preparation for, focusing on case questions. One of the interviewers seemed to have a preset notion of an answer he wanted to hear and was stunned that I actually asked structured questions. I got nervous from lack of feedback and sort of botched my answer. So I wound up doing well on one but needing some more prep for the other interview.The good part is that you can study up and try again.

I got a call out of the blue from Facebook after radio silence for 9 months.The much vaunted onsite interview process consisted of 3 interviews around Product Sense, Execution and Leadership.The culture at Facebook seemed rather bro-grammy. This is an outsiders perspective on the lack of gender diversity on the floor I was interviewing on. There wasn't even one token woman on the panel and the questions were geared towards…  "quick, show us how smart you are".The questions themselves have been detailed on Glassdoor before and include "favorite FB feature", " redesign events", etc. Typically these are a lot of fun if it's a dialogue rather than a rapid-fire "I'm so smart, I'm just going to listen to the sound of my voice rather than what you are saying"Needless to say, it was off-putting. I walked away with the impression that this wouldn't be a place where I could thrive or be more than a small cog in a large wheel or have my opinions respected at One Hacker Way.I would like to refer Facebook to the First Round post on how Etsy grew its female engineers over 500% with carefully avoidance of bias during interviews.

Recruiter called me. Sent resume. Never heard back from hiring manager. Unfortunately they flaked on me during the process and never bothered to follow up in spite of their initial interest. I am really not sure what happened as they told me the team was on vacation so why would you waste a candidate time if you are not going to even give them an interview?

Incredibly exhausting single-day set of product interviews (with six people) starting at 9am and ending around 5pm. Extremely smart people and I really enjoyed the conversations. They give product managers a lot of responsibility.

The process moves slow. Sometimes it feels as though people are unprepared for calls that they've scheduled. There's seemingly a lot of disorganization among the recruiters I've dealt with. Sometimes it seems as though you must really be on top of them in the beginning.

I had applied for a Rotational Product Manager position through a employee referral. The recruiter was pretty quick in getting back to me. The first call was with the recruiter and the questions were pretty basic - tell me something about yourself, why Facebook etc. She also asked me which products in Facebook would I like to work on and if there is anything I would like to change in…  any of the products. At the end of the call she said she would set up a phone interview and told me that the interview would be "Product Sense" interview. More of how to design a product and what choices I would make in the process.The phone interview was 45 mins. The first 10 mins was more of introductions. The question was - how would you improve Facebook birthdays, and the follow up questions included what metrics would you use to measure the successful launch of your product, how would you prioritize your features.

Initial screening and interview overview, then two phone calls with two PMs: on either product sense, execution, and/or leadership. If you move on from phone calls, you end up doing an onsite with three additional PMs who screen for the above mentioned three categories.

Contacted by recruiter via LinkedIn. He was overly enthusiastic and was over selling FB!I didn't have a phone interview. It was in person with a couple of product managers.Recruiter walked me through the campus and talked about how great FB is. Then walked me into a tiny little conference room with a table and 2 chairs. The room was very small and uncomfortable. Felt very suffocated.I interviewed with 2 product…  managers.Questions were in the area of growth and analytics. Not hard but it helps to understand their POV because they are looking to understand how you answer the questions vs what your answer is.I got the sense that they like to hire people in their 20s. I also learned from the recruiter that there aren't any women in Product Management. Seems like its a boys club and tough to get through !I was very disappointed by the tone of the interview and overall both interviewers were full of themselves.

Was referred through a friend with a relatively powerful position at the company, since his company was acquired by Facebook. My first point of contact as an employee referral program recruiter. There seemed to be some confusion as to who I was. At first they rejected my application without an explanation, but when I explained my situation they apologized and passed me on to a different recruiter. I had one…  phone interview with them and they said they weren't interested.

My first, and second-round interviews were at HQ. Facebook has three types of interviews: Product Sense, Product Execution, and Leadership.My first round interview I met with two people, one for Product Sense, and one for Product Execution.My second round interview I met with three people, one for each category. Yes, Product Sense, and Product Execution interviews are done twice.Product Sense: this interview revolves around questions like "What would you build?"…  "Suppose we wanted to improve the photos experience." The interviews are trying to get at your sense from product.Product Execution: here, questions like "Newsfeed engagement has decreased 2% week-over-week. why?" or "You're sitting with a data analyst, and you know there's a mobile problem in our new release. What would you ask him?"Leadership: here the FB team is trying to figure out if you're inspiring, if you work well with others--it's a behavioral interview. Be expected to answer questions such as "Tell me about a time when you experienced a challenge building a product. What did you do?" or "What's your biggest accomplishment?"

The process was pleasant and everyone was very nice and smart. I had a phone interview, a week went by and I had a second. Three weeks then passed so I emailed the recruiter and an onsite was scheduled.1st Phone Interview: Product Sense, questions about how I would solve a hypothetical problem. For example, if FB wanted to build a new recruiting tool, how would I go about testing my…  hypothesis and verifying my problem identification and solution.2nd Phone Interview: This one was termed "Execution", which I interpreted as assigning values to features and the process I would go through to vet a feature's or product's value. Turned out it was all about analytics and metrics: "How would you decide whether to show a friend suggestion in the FB news feed every ten feed items versus an advertisement?" "What are the trade-offs etc?" A lot of the interview focused on relative trade-offs and comparisons. I felt I did really badly but then got the onsite and final round invite.Onsite/Final Round: First interview focused again on Product Sense - "how would I change the news feed?", "what new feature would I build?". The second interview focused on leadership, "tell me about a time_____", and was designed to assess my ability to influence people and inspire. The third interview was back to Execution. I was asked to point out UI changes in the current app and use the whiteboard to graph examples of how metrics I would roll out of bed and want to look at would look.Overall, the experience was positive though the process was extremely lengthy considering there was no offer. After my final interview I was told I'd know within three days. Two weeks went by so I called and left the recruiter a voice-mail. Another week and a half went by so I emailed and finally got the "thanks but no thanks" (though worded very nicely and appropriately).

I had a phone interview with a recruiter who didn't seem to be very interested in me. They were rushing me off the phone, and it felt very much like I had been talking to a telemarketer.I had two of phone interviews with two PMs. They were very friendly people, but it did seem like they kept trying to summarize my answers for me (mansplaining anyone?). One of them tried…  to "grade" an answer on the spot, saying I got all the answers right except one item....and it turns out I did say that. Perhaps he didn't hear me, and I didn't want to correct him (I was already being mansplained to death).Not sure I am convinced FB is doing much to increase or help diversity on their end, judging from this interview process.You should study the questions here on Glassdoor. Many of the questions here are what was asked of me on my phone interviews.

Great interview process, recruiters and interviewers. The recruiter does a prep session with you beforehand that is very handy. They basically want to ensure a candidate does his best. I didn't do well on the interviews, but this is entirely my fault (FB did a great job to help me prepare). I connected with a recruiter through linkedin, i had a phone screen with a recruiter and then was brought…  in for 1st round of onsite interview - 2 interviews (one on Product and one on Execution) in the Seattle office. I wasn't called back for the second round.

I had three phone interviews, and then was flown out to Menlo park for three on-site interviews. Interviewers asked very detailed questions and often challenged you on your answers. Recruiters were prompt and the process moved quickly but I didn't get much background before the interviews. It was a difficult but positive interview process.

I went to a career fair, and drop my resume at the Facebook's Booth, I received an email from the recruiter saying that my CV was a good one. The email, gave me the steps I would have need to go through to the following day it was actually a small preparation from Facebook before the actual interview.

First an interview phone screen with a very knowledgable, followed by two phone interviews with current Facebook PMs. All the questions probed into how you thought about understanding users, features, technologies, and the vision you had for building things. People are friendly and smart but will definitely push you to justify your responses and be thoughtful.They very much want to see how you think rather than have you talk about…  your CV.There are specific interviews during the final on-site round covering (1) analytics, (2) usability and design, and (3) vision --e.g. what would you want to build if time/resources were not a constraint

There are several interviews that one has to go through in order to be considered. After passing the recruiter screen, I went through a phone screen where I had a discussion with the hiring manager, who would gauge my fit for the team/company. Once passed, I went on to a full interview where several members of the team would interview me from different perspectives, technical depth, continued cultural fit, and…  basic PM skillset

Referred through a friend, phone interview first. Asked facebook product related questions, why facebook, why PM, normal stuff. Then skipped second phone screen to onsite interviews. 3 interviews, 1 logic based, 1 future trends based, and 1 product design based. The logic one was tricky but can be cracked with a little more prep.

I reached out to my university recruiter and she promptly went through a phone screen with me to learn more about my background and my interest in the role. Towards the end of the conversation, she said she would feel comfortable passing me along to a product manager for a 45 minute phone screen.The phone screen consisted of culture-fit questions (Why Facebook? What is something interesting about you?) and then…  moved on to product specific questions (What is your favorite feature of Facebook? How would you improve it?) I would recommend preparing a bit beforehand.Finally, I was invited to their on-site interview which was probably the most fun PM interview I have had. They have three interviews that are focused on 1) future 2) reasoning and 3) product. Make sure you are structured and can tie everything back to Facebook and their core products.Overall, I had a fantastic time interviewing here and although it did not work out in the end, the culture is fun, people are great and the campus is unreal!

Facebook really needs to change their interviewing process. It's horrid.No matter how much experience you have, you won't be asked a single thing about your resume. In fact, nobody will even bring a copy to the interview. I found this disappointing because I have over 10 years of experience at previous companies. I could have been a bumbling idiot at other companies and they would never know.The Product Manager to…  Developer ratio is insane. For the group that I talked to there were 5-6 product managers for 200 developers. This 1:40 ratio basically means that product managers are rare unicorns and you won't get a job offer. In fact, look through the product manager interview feedback here and you won't see a single "offer declined" posting.You will be asked a bunch of quant questions instead. In one interview that I had, the interviewer didn't introduce himself at all and we did 4 case questions in a row over 45 minutes including "How would you determine how to rank posts in the news feed", "How would you determine the negative value of an abusive posting", "How would you calculate the number of daily registrations that Facebook has". They're good questions but wow it's a ton of work.By far the worst interview questions that I've ever gotten came up with 2 different interviewers here. I'm actually sorry that I didn't do more research online before the interview because these questions are the most easily prepared for. I could have memorized the answers ahead of time. Question was "Pick an industry that will be different in 10 years and how can Facebook be a part of that". It's pretty difficult to be that creative on the spot. I wish I gave the question an hour of thought before coming to the interview.I was disappointed with the quality of people that I interviewed with considering that Facebook is one of the more recognized names in the business. Product Managers frequently had just 2-3 years of experience.

2 phone screens, then an onsite interview consisting of 5 separate interviews. Very quick process, got calls back within a few days and an offer package within a week of interviewing

Very capable recruiter who was prompt and always available.

I was introduced to a technical recruiter while I was visiting a friend at the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park. I received a preliminary email to set up a screening call two days later. The screening call was 45 mins long and focused on my background and previous experience. The recruiter was very polite and efficient. At the end of the interview the recruiter asked me to send her my…  availabilities for a preliminary phone interview.The initial phone interview was setup for two weeks later and involved 2, 45-minute interviews with two different Facebook product managers. The recruiter called me a couple of hours before to tell me the first interview was to focus on "vision" and the second to focus on "analytics".The product managers I spoke to were both polite and quite efficient. After some pleasantries we got into the first real question which was "Choose a technology you are particularly excited about and why". Then the interviewer asked me to talk about the disadvantages of the new technology and it's potential negative effects. The third question was about how this new technology could be integrated into a Facebook product. This part was tricky because I had chose a technology that would be difficult to integrate into Facebook products given their challenges with privacy issues. I felt the interview when well and I was confident in my answers but I would like to have chosen a technology that was a more natural fit with Facebook's current products.The second phone interview took place right after the first and focused on analytics. "You are the PM of the Facebook timeline - how would you measure retention?". My background is with small startups and I could tell right away that the interviewer didn't like my answers as he kept asking the same question in a different way. I felt that I answered the questions well but the interview ended 5 mins early and I was not asked for a follow up on-site interview.

The recruiters were very good, personable and open and honest and felt like they were on your side. The interviews were 30-45 mins each and interactive. Lots of exploratory questions and brainstorming ideas and scenarios. It was a very enjoyable experience overall.

Had a phone screen with the recruiter followed by an on-site interview with 2 PMs.The on-site included 1 vision interview and 1 product analysis interview.The vision interview was surprisingly broad, exploring other industries which was quite fun.Overall, very positive experience.

Applied online and contacted by recruiter through email a week afterwards and set up phone interview. Before we talked I sent her an email to confirm our call. She replied very shortly and told me that we had already discussed that and to re-read our emails.When she did call, she immediately started the conversation by saying she didn't have much time to talk which was off putting b/c we specifically…  chose this time for the interview. Not a conversation at all, felt like I was talking to a robot. Set up another interview for two weeks later b/c she had a work trip the following week and couldn't talk then (which was a total cop out)Talked to her again for the second phone interview. Not receptive at all. When I told her about my future plans for Facebook she said it wasn't much different from what they have now. (It is, but she was apparently expecting more than my already unconventional ideas).A week and a half went by with no contact. I emailed her to check in and told me to re-apply the next year. No feedback on why I wasn't selected.I really don't know why she even contacted me to begin with. Seems like she made up her mind that she wasn't going to hire me from the moment she sent the first snarky email. She was uninformative and unprofessional, rushing our conversations and delaying our contact.Overall, inauthentic experience with a company of such caliber.

1. Phone screen by Recruiter.2. First on-site with 2 PM interviewers.3. Second on-site with 3 PM interviewers and a Director of PM4. I think this is not usual but I had a follow-on call with a senior PM too.Everything about the interview process - from the instructions to sign-in to transitioning from one interviewer to the next - was done very smoothly and professionally, which made a really strong impression.However,…  they rejected me for the PM role and wanted to consider me for other roles. During the transition from one team to another, things started to fall through the cracks.Nevertheless, great impression of the company overall.

I was contacted by a FB recruiter via LinkedIn and had two rounds of interviews. The first round was with two PMs and the second with three more.Each interview focused on one particular subject, such as:- Logic. Estimate something, such as how many email messages are sent in a day worldwide via mobile devices. Identify the most important factors when determining whether product X is successful or not. They want…  to see that you can think quantitatively and have a clear thought process.- Vision. Imagine an industry 10 years out (transportation, local commerce, fashion, etc.) and describe it. This was the interview I most enjoyed, as it's really about brainstorming and thinking BIG. The key is to identify trends and have a framework for evaluating what could be.- Design. Typical PM stuff -- design a new feature or product. What's the framework for identifying needs and segments. Identify solutions and priorities. Draw rough wireframes.- Cultural Fit. Are you a good person? Will you fit with other FBers? They ask you typical interview questions here like: why do you want to work at FB, what would you most want to work on, etc.Overall the PMs are exceptionally nice and really tried to make our meetings more like conversations rather than interviews. Honestly I wasn't sure about joining FB before I interviewed but was convinced during the course of the interviews by the really smart and nice guys I met during the process.The process was relatively quick -- from the time of first contact to the offer was about a month. Overall, one of the best interview processes I've been through, and props to the Facebook PM management for actively training their PMs on how to interview!

2 phone screens followed by onsite

Had in-person interview with two people. The first interview was more about industry, vision - what areas FB can invest in etc. The second one was more on analytics, data.Both persons were nice, easy to talk and the tone of the interview was casual discussion.

I was surprised and give high marks for a very well-run PM recruiting process at Facebook. I had a friend there get my resume to the PM recruiter, who called within a few days. The recruiter was extremely knowledgeable and conducted a rather in-depth screening interview himself that lasted 20-30 minutes. At the end of the interview he was very forward that I passed his smoke test and needed to…  get in for some on-site interviews. He was very communicative over the course of the next few days (first call was on Tuesday) and set up 2 interviews by the end of that week. He called the day before the interviews to prep me.The first two on-site interviews with PMs were much more congenial and collaborative than other BigCo PM interviews I've had. I was impressed. The personality they're looking for shines through and it's obvious that they give a good amount of autonomy and power to their PMs. The internal recruiter took 10-15 minutes to give me a tour, chat about anything, and was very informative and warm.The PM recruiting team communicated often to let me know where they were in the process, and I had a go-ahead for 2nd round interviews within a week. Again I was prepped a day before interviews. I had 4 interviews scheduled for my 2nd round, each about 45 minutes long. Questions ranged from product/feature design to mapping the flow of interactions between people and discussing needs/motivation to general industry knowledge and strategy. None of the interviewers were hostile or cold.Although I was not given an offer, I was again surprised and quite happy that the recruiter reached out to offer feedback. He shared details of what I did well and what I could improve on by phone.

I was contacted by a recruiter, and scheduled an interview. I wasn't sure about it but it seemed foolish not even to talk to Facebook. Invited to the new Menlo Park campus for two in-person interview with two different PMs.One interview focused on improvements and product ideas for Facebook. The interviewers were both very pleasant to talk to, and pushed every idea I'd come up with further, asking questions like…  "What are the potential drawbacks of that?" or "How would you integrate that with X other feature on Facebook?"The other focused on logic and estimation problems, seeing if I could come up with a reasonable method for estimating impossible-to-nail values. This was pretty fun, actually, and I think went pretty well.In the end, I received an email rejection after following up a few days later with a vague statement about how I could have had better vision -- reading between the lines, I hadn't done my homework in advance on the current cutting-edge developments at Facebook.Still a very positive experience, and the two PMs I talked to were genuine, friendly, and enthusiastic about the process and any questions I had.

1 day phone interview, 2 days on-siteprepared ideas/sketches for new product ideassome interviewers were open/willing to listen to background & ideas, while others seemed disinterested and had their own point of view to pushbackground or experience is NOT valuedreviewed, in-depth current product offering and suggested improvements, but it never came off as valuable to them, just whether or not it fit with the Facebook stance

The recruiter wanted to do a phone interview. She kept postponing or entirely forgetting - I think that was extremely rude even for Facebook. Finally managed a 1:1 interview. Kept waiting in the lobby, eventually was escorted to the interview room. Found the interviewer sitting there. The interviewer was asking a few questions and seemed to be interested. What threw me off was that the interviewer asked the same question…  in a different way that I have already answered (e.g. what changes would you like to make). Looked like the interviewer was taking notes furiously or was it doodling ?

I passed a phone screen with a recruiter and was then invited in for an in person interview. They had me come all the way to campus in the middle of the work day only for one interview. My interviewer didn't ask very challenging questions, so it was easy to do well. But then I was told by the recruiter that they had no interest in me. I'm not sure…  why they wasted my time having me come in. It also seems unfair to use one very junior PM's limited evaluation of me to make their entire judgement. I feel like that interview should have been on the phone, or they should have had someone more than a year and a half out of school interview me when I was on campus, too.

Very professional and timely ... the HR recruiter and the PM who interviewed me were both very candid, which was much appreciated.Given my seniority, there were no open positions in this role, for which they hire far fewer people than for engineering roles.

I was approached by a Facebook recruiter through linkedin,having a breif call with her followed by an interview with a product manager using bluejeans software app.Prior to the inteview, i received a breif explenation from the recruiter followed by a document on which areas the interview will focus, and I felt the document was helpful in preparing for the inteview.The interview was short (less than 40 minutes). Two days after…  the interview I received a rejection from the recruiter.In general I would say that the people in the procedure were kind, and helpful.

I applied online for the Rotational PM role (new grad) and received a response rather quickly. There was a brief HR screen then I was invited for a phone interview from a full-time former RPM. Very casual chat and they asked a lot of clarifying questions for my design. The program is very selective so they seem to be looking for exceptional clarity and thoughtful design.

Had two phone interviews and then an on-site interview day. The two phone interviews were a combination of design scenarios (ie. "If you were the product manager at Facebook for a new product in the x industry", where x is an industry that isn't known to be social) and personality type questions (ie. "Tell me about impact in your career."). The on-site interview varied from understanding the health of a…  web application (using metrics), situational questions (ie. "How would you determine how many new users we should expect to get tomorrow?" "If an important metric drops by 50% of expected value, what would you do?"), wire-framing a new product for mobile, questions about the future of social.There were technical questions, but no algorithm questions, coding, or distributed system level design questions which was surprising given the nature of building/designing large scale web and mobile applications.

One of the more appropriate interviews I've had for a gig. Articulate people and very focused, I got as far as the initial screen plus two interviews with staff. They are clearly looking for people with broad vision and a proven ability to execute, and given the small number of product managers (something like 60 for a staff of 4000), they are very choosy. Also, the process happened over the…  course of about 2-3 weeks and, in my case, it happened remotely as I was on the east coast of Canada. I was ultimately not successful,

I have been through an HR screening and product manager interview. Here is how it went:HR phone screening was very informative. HR was responsive and very helpful.Following HR screening, I was scheduled to have a phone interview with a product manager. PM called me 10 minutes late, apologizing that he was not sure if the interview was confirmed or not. He said that he didn't have a chance to review…  my background. Well, ok... And then he ended the interview in 25 minutes (it was scheduled to be 45 minutes), of which half of the time was spent in regular meet-greet-intro-questions. HR decided not to proceed further in the process. The feedback was that the interviewer had hoped to get more on product vision. I have been interviewing, hiring and building teams for years now and I am not really sure how anyone can assess one's product vision in a 25-minute phone interview. I found the overall experience very unprofessional and somehow disrespectful to the candidate (well to me…). I spent days prepping for the interview, reading even the Facebook developer documents to familiarize myself with the offerings of the company that I may not be aware of. So I expected a little more than a late-starting 25-minute opportunity.

4 interviews back to back in one afternoon.

Standard interview practice of 2 phone interviews and then one day of 1:1 interviews. Phone interviews were fairly high level and covered innovation and product design. 1:1 interviews went much deeper on a variety of topics. Most were focused on problems/issues that each person was tackling in their job today, so these were very FB specific.

**************************************Security Engineer**************************************
It was all about projects. The logic used to implement various projects were challenged in order to make sure that you had really thought it through. Some behavioral questions were asked too to see if I could work independently as well as in team environment.

I applied on Facebook career portal and was pleasantly surprised (and excited) when contacted (I have a Microsoft tech heavy profile) by their recruiter. Had promptly facilitated telephonic interview (general application security related) and then another phone interview.I was then asked to attend a series of onsite interviews.Did not get an offer but thoroughly enjoyed talking to all the interviewers.These is an amazing bunch of people tackling security issues at…  an unprecedented scale.I will definitely re apply in the future!

**************************************User Experience Researcher, University**************************************
Pretty unprofessional recruiter, missed the scheduled phone interview after being referred over through someone that worked in the design team.Got a call back after two weeks of referral.Phone interview was pretty standard. Why do you want to work here specifically at Facebook? What UX? What experience do you have? etc.

**************************************Test**************************************
it was a phone screening from the recruiter, and the duration was 30 minutes. a lot of stuff was covered, including technical skills, teamwork and project roles. was also asked about the reason for leaving the current position.

**************************************Principal Writer (User Operations)**************************************
I submitted my resume online and was able to indicate a Facebook employee (a former colleague of mine) to act as a reference.A week later, I was contacted by a recruiter letting me know that based on my profile I looked like I would be a good fit, and included a writing test for me to complete in one week, which was a sufficient amount of time. The writing test…  included two parts: first, write one page guide for users on how to use FB Events, specifically for the teacher demographic.About one week later, the same recruiter wrote me saying I had passed the writing test and that she would like to chat on the phone. The phone interview with the recruiter was pretty straight-forward. She just asked me about my background, what type of work I did at each job, why I left each, and why I'd like to work for Facebook. She also asked me if I had used data to make decisions, inform my writing, and also whether I had done a/b testing. Towards the end she asked me housekeeping questions, was I considering other jobs, when could I start, what my salary expectations were, and after that she said everything checked out and she felt comfortable inviting me to meet with the content team for an on-site interview, plus another writing test. Her advice to me: study Facebook Help Center, Facebook in the press, think analytically about how to improve Help Center, user education considering mobile and international audiences.A few days later, the details of my on-site interview were e-mailed to me by an HR assistant, laid out nicely and clearly. I had about 1.5 weeks to prepare for the on-site and took the recruiter's advice.On-site interview was on a Wednesday from 9 to 11:30 AM.First 30 minutes were dedicated to the writing test given. They provided me with a Macbook in a small conference room. The writing prompt asked me to re-write two FAQs from the Help Center. I was interrupted twice during my writing test, once by the HR assistant who came in to connect the ethernet cable, and a second time by the original recruiter who introduced herself and mentioned that the first writing test would have more weight than this one, this one was more to test how I write under pressure. I still don't know if those interruptions were intentional, either way, I lost about 5 minutes and this led to me not being able to complete the writing test (had about 25% left).Next two hours, I met with 5 people on the content team; three were 1:1 including with the hiring manager, and I met with the two more junior team members as a pair. They all came into the conference room with their MacBook Pros ready to type notes as they interviewed me. All their questions were about the same: describe myself, what was my work like at X, Y, Z. How would I improve the Help Center, How have I used data to inform writing, What do I think is the point of the Help Center, etc. etc. The hiring manager asked questions with a little more purpose. She asked me what other writing jobs I was looking at, when I described them to her she said they sounded a lot more "creative" than the work I'd be doing at Facebook and was that OK with me? I was caught off guard by that, but kept my ground and kept it positive. She also asked me if I had experience doing pivot tables. I said yes but my voice wavered as I do not have a lot of experience with it. She emphasized a couple more times in the conversation that there was no room for creativity or color in Help Center content, and that that was more for the Marketing team. I think after talking to me she sensed that the type of work I am better fit for is more editorial and creative, and the actual work at Facebook would not be fulfilling to me as someone 5 years into my writing/marketing career with a strong sense of what I want to do and feel most passionately about.One week later, I got an e-mail from Facebook recruiting thanking me, saying I was not a fit based on my background, etc. Pretty standard. I think the interviews went well for me, but in the end, I was not a fit.

**************************************Software Engineer (New Grad)**************************************
I applied online but I didn't get an interview until a friend referred me. I had a few offer deadlines coming up, HR was super nice about it and helped me get a phone screen quickly. I got an email saying it would be through skype but instead I got a phone call and as you can imagine, I got the all too familiar guy-with-heavy-accent-that-i-can-hardly-hear. Also the connection was pretty…  bad, so he kept cutting out. I had to keep asking him to repeat himself but in the end kind of just gave up.Regardless of the communication issues, I don't think I was completely prepared to do the phone screen, had trouble executing the algorithm I came up with, etc. Oh whale, next time!

I had one on campus interview, a follow up phone interview and then an on-site interview at their HQ in downtown Palo Alto. HR did a fantastic job with coordinating the interview day but the engineers that interviewed me were on their cell phones and did not seem interested in conducting a comprehensive interview. Every interviewer started off with "Why Facebook?" and asked an algorithm and design question. I realized…  later that almost all the programming questions I was asked were pulled DIRECTLY from "Programming Interviews Exposed". From the book:The design questions were centered around processing large amounts of data, caching, time complexity, etc.

**************************************Diversity Program Director**************************************
The hiring process was fast but included 5 interviews. The first three were phone conferences that lasted about 30 minutes. The last two were on site visits. The folks there were so helpful. The recruiter not only prepped me for the questions, but she also made sure that I knew what the other reviewers said about me.

**************************************, Software Engineer**************************************
I had an overview phone interview where I was asked about my past work and then I had two coding interviews. I didn't make it but found the overall interview process enjoyable and fair. One of my interviews had an accent that was really difficult to understand but he was very patient and understanding.

**************************************Marketing Strategist**************************************
Process: I applied online, recruiter contacted me and described the position briefly. There were a couple of phone screens and I then went onsite. On the day, I made a presentation and had 5 other rounds.About the role: This is a new role for them and they are still figuring out what they are looking for. The person will temporarily report to a lead for a different vertical till they…  can figure out a more permanent reporting/management structure. The ambiguity in background and skills required was reflected during multiple conversations and made the interview unnecessarily difficult.Interview experience: I spoke with 8 people during multiple interviews, all of whom were professional but for the recruiter. The conversations with the recruiter were by far the worst professional conversations I have ever had. Email communication was devoid of any punctuation, incomplete and unprofessional. In one case, there were 4 sentences without any punctuation whatsoever.Phone conversations were worse. As an example, when asked what the second phone screen might focus on, the response was "well we do these phone screens so that we do not waste our interviewers time by getting you here.". Well, I know the purpose of screening, not what I was asking. Other conversations were similar. I considered pulling out of the interview multiple times to avoid being insulted.She misinformed me about the importance of SQL for the role and interview. Told me that SQL would be most important thing and was worried if I could clear. The job requirements stated SQL as nice-to-have. The SQL interviewer started the interview by saying that I would rarely require to do anything difficult in SQL. He asked very elementary questions during the interview, I wasted days preparing for way more advanced topics.I was given a presentation assignment with more than a month to prepare. The question was described in 3 sentences with internal terminology and expected me to tell FB what to do next for a particular area. She was not willing to have me speak to anyone to get clarifications on the terms used, scope of the problem, goal of the session etc.In the absence of any clarification, I spent multiple weeks working on it. Needless to say it was not what the interviewers had in mind. Simple things that could have been clarified by a 10 min call or a simple email.I went into the interview dreading interacting with the recruiter and came out with a very sour taste, though I am kinda certain my experience would not represent how FB treats their other candidates (having known others who have gone through the process).Earlier feedback on Glassdoor for the vertical that I interacted with (temporary reporting structure) is mostly neutral or negative as well. I feel positively about Facebook, hope they are reading this and will use this feedback to make necessary corrections.

Good people. Know their stuff. You need to read the job description really well and be sure that you speak to the requirements because *they* may not ask for them precisely in the interview: none the less are expecting you to cover these. They are perhaps more concerned with standard methods than they initially project. Carefree attitude in some employees in interview process, others are VERY interested to hear about…  process.

**************************************Market Specialist - Community Operations**************************************
I was contacted immediately after submitting my application by a recruiter, then followed by a technical test and language test, which lasted for 90 minutes (10 questions in total). After completing the test, I was contacted to schedule the 1st interview with the recruiter, the interview lasted for 30 minutes. The recruiter was very nice and encouraging, which made the whole interview very relaxing and very much conversational. She also…  let me know at the end of the interview that she would like to progress my application to the team. The next interview was scheduled with a team member, including behavioral questions, to test your understanding of the role and the tasks/ projects that the team will be facing on a daily basis, how you would make a decision in a specific situation. It wasn't an easy interview but the overall experience was great. At the end of the interview, you will be given the chance to ask the interviewer questions as well.

**************************************Public Relations**************************************
Thoughtful, lengthy, intense. Working with their recruiters was painful - lots of back and forth with little information. Smart people at FB, that gave each interview their full attention, which was impressive. Would recommend that they not drag their interview processes out because it can waste a candidate's time if they aren't ultimately hired.

**************************************Analyst, Partner Measurement**************************************
Recruiter reached out for an initial phone call with some behavioral and logic questions. She later followed up with an e-mail of several articles to prepare for an interview with the hiring manager.The hiring manager for the position was unavailable at the last minute so they had someone else on the team conduct the interview. The person that I spoke to was extremely rude and condescending, suggesting that my work…  at my current employer was not good enough for them, even though I had more work experience than her. After speaking to her, I no longer had any interest in working for Facebook and would not consider applying again.

**************************************N/A**************************************
I had two interviews that were both over the phone. The recruiters were extremely nice and seemed as if they had my best interest in mind. The interview was suppose to be over Skype, but both I and the recruiters had technical difficulties.

**************************************Hardware Intern**************************************
Asked simple questions about basic transistor device physics, general amplifier considerations, as well as some questions about coding i.e C,scripting,Python.

**************************************Partnerships Ops**************************************
Had two phone interviews. They were about a week apart from each other. They both went well, but the day after my second interview, I got an email saying that they found someone else more qualified for the job.

**************************************Privacy Manager**************************************
It started with a recruiter approaching me via LinkedIn. 2 days later , i had 2 phone technical interviews , from there I proceeded onsite and met with 3 teams.

**************************************Member of Technical Staff**************************************
Recruiter call and 2 phone interviews.Both phone interviews were with relatively easy tasks. The first one was two tasks - the first one was to calculate a sorted array of power of 2 for already sorted array of integers. The trick is that the negative numbers will become positive, you have to merge the negative with the positive powers of 2. I figured out this in few seconds. The interviewer…  though had no idea of c++, it asked me a bunch of basic questions about iterators and he lost my time for the second task, for which I provided only algorithm - it was to print a tree by columns.I received a feedback that I should not optimize my code before I have working solution. And I did good, but not great, so I need to have a second phone interview where I will be asked more complex task - make no sense to me, but ok.On the second interview I had again someone with no c++ experience. He asked me to create a powerset. I implemented it (and after the interview I copy/pasted it and it was working with one syntax issue). Surprisingly this was not enough for me to move to the next round. The interviewer was openly confused from the solution - maybe because it was not exact fit with what he read in internet. It took me forever to explain the algorithm that I am going to implement and he just hm-ed there. Then it took me a while to explain to him while reverse_iterator.base() does not return the item the reverse_iterator points, but the next one - not sure that he got it at all.What I learned: I should not use reverse_iterators in interview process. Being smart enough to come up with your own solution is not appreciated - so you should spend a lot of time to find out what other people say - you should do for the tasks. Facebook is the new google as google was the new microsoft a few years ago. Also do not take the Facebook interview preparation class - what they say is not aligned at all with the expectations the actual interviewers have.

**************************************Systems Project Manager**************************************
Interviewer was very polite. The interview started with a brief description about the profile and what Facebook is expecting from the new recruit. Later the interviewer began by asking the questions on past experience followed by a brief explanation on technical projects, clients, and team handled. Focus was also on open source technologies.

**************************************IT Manager**************************************
1st had a conversation with HR, then a Skype session with the hiring manager. The hiring manager Skype seems awkward. I got the impression they had already ruled me out before we even spoke. I'm not sure why I was having the interview if they weren't interested. The company as a whole would be great to work with and I have a lot of respect for Facebook. It would seem…  this wasn't a good fit for me considering what the hiring manager was looking for but the overall process was fair and speedy. HR in particular was good to work with and very communicative with me the entire way.

**************************************Analyst (Developer Operations)**************************************
Referred by a friend. After two weeks, my friend followed up on my application and I immediately got an email requesting a phone screen.Phone screen lasted about 20 minutes with mostly basic questions (ie. Why Facebook, why this particular position). Questions revolved around my skillset related to the job and there was the basic behaviorial question regarding team work.It seemed the recruiter was skeptical on my technical skills from the…  very beginning and was curt and mostly monotone (even when I specifically asked about the Facebook culture) but they weren't unpleasant.Emphasis was placed on Facebook applications that I used and knowledge of SQL. I do not know SQL so unfortunately this position was not a fit (job description did not call this out hence the disconnect on the interview). They also seemed to be looking for a candidate that was into gaming and used applications on the platform extensively.At the end of the interview, the recruiter did not ask for any questions which I thought was a bit strange (hello, red flag!) and they said they would speak with their hiring manager and let me know within a day or two. The next day I received an email saying that they would retain my resume for future positions but that I was not a match for their current openings.

**************************************Publisher Sales - Liverail**************************************
got referred from an employee.I had an interview with HRThen an interview with VPfeedback from HR who said no saying that they wanted someone with Video SSP experience despite the VP saying the opposite.

**************************************Risk Analyst**************************************
I applied online for the position at Facebook and heard back from a recruiter within 48 hours. We scheduled a phone interview for the end of the week which was pretty informal. The role was discussed as well as my background and other similar general questions. The recruiter then scheduled a phone interview with a member of the team. The interview with the team member consisted on general background questions…  and some behavioral questions. After my second round interview I was then told I would be flown to Mountain View for a third and final round. I met with 4 interviewers back to back and this interview involved case study questions as well as a lot of ambiguous questions about the future of Facebook which I was not really expecting (esp the case question). I waited about 2 weeks to hear back from the recruiter and was told I did not get the position.

I was impressed by the efficiency of recruiting at Facebook and how fast the process moved after I expressed my concerns with the recruiter (I was interviewing for other jobs at the same time).I had the initial phone interview with the recruiter, the second round phone interview with someone in the team, and the final round onsite interview within 2 weeks. The recruiter and the phone interviewer were very friendly,…  and the recruiter even "preped" me a little bit before my second round.I had the final round onsite with 4 people in the team in the Austin office. The first interview was via video conference with someone in the team in Menlo Park. He asked about my professional experience and quantitative skills. He also asked me how I will improve the game/advertising platform of Facebook. The second interviewer did a case study with me that is mentioned below. The third interviewers asked a lot of behavioral questions, e.g. tell me a time you managed a conflict, what do you do for fun, etc. The last interviewer was the head of the team and asked more behavioral questions.A week after the final round I got a call from the recruiter telling me that I didn't get an offer because I don't have enough experience in risk operations.Overall, people are Facebook are very smart, and the culture is very dynamic. The Austin office is very casual and they expect you to dress casually to the interview. Everyone I interviewed with was very approachable. I was very impressed with Facebook's culture and would definitely apply again!

Initial HR Screening interview with behavioral questions. Was then told I made it to the next round for a phone interview. Same easy behavioral questions (why FB, why risk, etc.). After that, I was told I would have another phone interview (very similar questions). Finally, I was flown for four different interviews at their headquarters. These questions were more analytical, which was a bit of a surprise.

**************************************Site Reliability Specialist**************************************
Interview was to determine if I was the perfect fit for job. Interviewer was truly professional and courteous. Informed me in detail the job position requirements to ascertain I completely understood the job description. I responded back candidly and admitted I was not the best candidate for the job unless they were going to train me. Unfortunately, the position had to be filled with a candidate who was already proficient.

**************************************Information Security Engineer, Compliance Analyst**************************************
Initially had a telephonic interview after which I was called down to the HQ at Menlo Park CA for two rounds of interview. Had the first interview within 15 minutes of my arrival, post which was accompanied for lunch, which was later followed by the second interview.The Interview process at Facebook is extremely streamlined. If you have your basics right and show that you can think out of the box…  for simple problems, cracking the interview should't be a problem.

**************************************Human Resources Role**************************************
Process moved fairly quick; 1 week or so.Recruiter reached out via email and we set up a call interview to discuss the role and my background within a couple of days. I was then referred to the hiring manager. The conversation with the hiring manager was great; simple questions about experience. However, I never heard back from the recruiter on status updates. I had to follow up a couple of…  times via email. I finally heard back, and they decided to move forward with another candidate.FB appears to be growing a lot, thus many more roles within HR opened up. I reached out the recruiter via email to discuss potential roles. I was over-qualified for some and others I had the sufficient experience. I never heard back. After a week or so, recruiter responded stating that they are moving forward with other candidates.I recently had interest for another role, and I received feedback that according to the same recruiter, they had an internal fit for it.This was an interesting experience, and it is unfortunate that the recruiter did not take the proper time to explore a potential candidate with professional, valuable conversations. A simple conversation to better understand their needs and how my background would fit, would have made sense. At times, I wonder if these recruiters should be required to have more experience, given the excellent pool of candidates out in Silicon Valley?! You just never know who you may be putting to the side.It appears as if the process is put at a "stop" based on the recruiters bias towards a candidate they have never met before or never personally worked with.It is a loss for FB if the candidate could have been one to make a huge positive impact (who would know?) I was left with a sour taste of their culture, and that is unfortunate.

**************************************Communications Director**************************************
Had a great interview with the recruiter who was setting me up to speak with the hiring manager. A week went by and I didn't hear back so I followed up. The recruiter was very responsive and said it would be about another week. Another week passed by and I didn't hear back. Disappointed with the process so far.

**************************************Marketing Insights Analyst**************************************
I had a couple of recruiter phone screens, and then a couple of technical phone screens before going onsite. The interview process was very good until I went there for onsite. The questions asked during phone screens seemed legitimate for the role. Recruiter helped through the process during phone screens. During onsite, almost every interviewer was late. Recruiter seemed not interested during the day. Interview questions weren't deep enough. I…  answered all the questions to my best. I didn't stumble on any question. I prepared thoroughly on FB products, metrics, probability, and SQL. No questions were asked in these areas during the onsite. It was almost like they decided not to hire before the onsite. The recruiting criteria is not transparent. Recruiter didnt share any feedback after the interview.

**************************************SE**************************************
I submitted my resume on the career fair at my college. Then, after a week, I got one on-campus interview, and one onsite interview for the intern position. Each interview contains two coding questions.

**************************************Marketing Specialist**************************************
I applied through employee referral in November 2016. It took about 2 weeks. The recruiter first asked me to complete a brief exercise to assess my writing skills in the language I applied for, then I had phone interview, and group interview.

**************************************Payment Operations Analyst**************************************
The process begins with a phone screening interview by the head of the department. If you pass this first step, you will be invited to a second and final in-house interview of two hours where you will be asked to sit in a room for a bit as three different team members come in separately to ask you basic questions about your qualifications.

Applied for the position through my school's career services website, and got called for an interview about a week later. First interview was very casual with someone who was in the same position I was interviewing for. Exactly 2 weeks later I got an email for a second on-site interview that would last about 2 hours. Had 3 different interviews, each focused on something different: 1st focused on team work…  and experience, 2nd on personality and fit at Facebook, and 3rd with the same interviewer from the initial round about the specifics of the position. The recruiter was very friendly and gave me a tour of the office, and sat down to chat with me at the end. I got a call the very next day saying that they wanted to move forward and check my references, and I really appreciated the promptness. Early the next week I got a call saying my references were good, they were getting my offer package ready and would be in touch by the end of the week. In the mean time wanted me to talk on the phone with the person who would be my direct manager. He repeated a lot of the questions from the on-site interview, so it was simple. Didn't hear from them at the end of the week, and after freaking out all weekend finally called on Monday and found out I didn't get the job. Turns out they wanted someone with more experience, which even the recruiter admitted should have been made clear from the very beginning and was sorry for leading me on. She was very gracious with feedback about the interviews and told me to keep in touch. Even though I was caught completely off guard when I didn't receive an offer, it was a good experience overall and I will apply again one day.

**************************************Frontend Software Engineer**************************************
Have an initial brief interview with recruiter who asks basic information about HTML/CSS. Next step is an online coding challenge, not too hard but not too simple either, uses frontend HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

**************************************Ad Specialist**************************************
Super friendly interview process. 2 telephones interview, 3 on-sites interview. So far the best process interview that I have ever experienced in my life!

**************************************Community Operations Analyst - Croatian/Serbian Market**************************************
The process is mainly the same as you can read from other experiences here on the Glassdoor.1st step is a 10 questions online test. Most of the questions are logical/analytic, more or less very similar to the ones you would have for an GMAT tests. You have a specific time frame in which you have to fill it in. I believe it was around 1.5hr, but the test can be…  done in less time, so you don't have to rush as on oth2nd step is the phone interview by the HR recruiter, mostly to check if you are not a complete wacko, also they try to check if you have some basic skills for the job. It took around 15-20min3rd step is another phone interview with one of the team members. It took an hour, and it was checking the logical reasoning4th step is a 3 back-to-back interviews. First two were very easy going, but the third one was with two colleagues in which one was doing all the talking. I guess they were using the tactic of good cop/bad cop, but it was just the bad cop, because the good cop was too afraid of the bad cop :) anyway, after that interview I had a bad feeling I did something wrong, and eventually I got the email stating they chose another candidate. Lucky me, in a few days I got a much better offer from a another company so my job changing story had a happy end.All in all, the interview process was very nice. After each step I would get a feedback from the HR recruiter and she would tell me what did I do wrong and what did I do good. Also they would send me some general guidelines on how to prepare for each step, which I think is very cool. However, one negative remark. They would call me after each step to give me feedback, which is a very cool thing, but then after the last interview I got the usual "thank you for applying" email, which is not according to the expectation they create by giving you feedback after each step. At least they could've called after I reached the last round. I guess they haven't interviewed too many people for the last round.

**************************************SMB Project Manager**************************************
Recruiter emailed asking for availability then didn't respond. I emailed to ask if she received my availability and she didn't respond. A few weeks later she emailed back and said the position had been filled but she would still like to chat and asked for availability. I sent my availability and she didn't respond.

**************************************Hardware Validation Engineer**************************************
Initial recruiter called about 2 months after applying for position on website. We had a short 15 min phone interview after which I was setup for a phone interview with the hiring manager.Unfortunately, there was a language barrier issue. Many of the questions I couldn't answer because I didn't know what the question was rather than the question being difficult. I work in networking hardware and when I was asked…  "was is ART?" I had no clue how ART relates to networking hardware. After getting off the phone I realized the question probably was "was is ARP?" Most of the questions were like this. The interviewer also cut off the interview prematurely as I was trying to get him to repeat one of the questions.I felt like I didn't get a fair shake, but flushing out these issues ahead of time with the person that is going to be your boss I guess isn't the worst thing.

**************************************Product Support Specialist**************************************
1) Interview phone call with the recruiter.2) On-site interviews (a total of 3).3) Hiring manager interview (this was a phone call since the hiring manager was based in Austin).4) Reference check (you provide 2 or more references).5) Offer.6) Background check.

Upon emailing me a rejection for a different role, a recruiter copied a different recruiter and role that they thought I'd be good for. It was the Prod Spec role. I didn't have experience in product support, but the role looked mostly analytical so I moved forward.First call with the recruiter, then a call with hiring manager. She wasn't available, so I spoke to someone on a different team who…  gave me general info on systems and teams, but not role specific.Onsite interviews included 4x30 minute sessions, 3 being scheduled as video call due to the interviewers being remote. The video calls hurt my performance and added awkwardness because they show you in full body view and were distracting.The team members asked a few technical/analytical questions, and the hiring manager asked vague questions about why I was a good fit and what did the role need to contribute to Sales and Engineering. Having no direct experience, or understanding of why HR put me in for this role, I answered as best I could, but struggled to know what she wanted.The one in-person meeting went well: he asked prioritisation questions with context, and spent an hour with me.Recruiter was brusk about my request to send thank you notes, and in the rejection email basically said the team felt I was sub par in analytical/critical thinking skills. No encouraging note of good will or try again.Frankly, the only analytical questions I was actually asked were on probability and prime numbers, not things that even appropriately relate to the role. No SQL or Excel test, as other reviewers mentioned for this role.The whole process felt disorganised and I got different explanations about the team from each person. The recruiter pushed hard on salary talk early on, and set low expectations. I also wasn't prepped on what to expect with the onsite, like other companies do. Oh well, not a good fit for me anyway.

Had a phone screen with the recruiter, which I thought went well. She promised to follow up 'soon'. 2 weeks go by and no word. She apologizes for delay and explains that they are doing headcount. I ping for an update, and receive a reply that the role had been filled - 1 week later. Very unprofessional, poor experience. Waste of my time and energy.

**************************************Applications Engineer**************************************
First round of interview was telephonic and then got a mail to attend in person interview,the process was good...Questions were very simple and they just ask you in a tricky way .....i felt i was little bit slow in understanding the questions and asked him to repeat for few more times ...he was very understanding even helping me on possible ways to clear the answer .......No idea about the result…  ....No expections either ...but felt good about their process of interviewing. No questions on your resume or your work in first technical round ....they just go with your main coding language and screen you on that (basics) firstly and then proceed further..........Hope this might help you guys to prepare well for the interviewer.....just concentrate on basics of your skilled language ....All the best :)

Two phone interviews. It is one week between two interviews. The HR has very high efficiency in arranging interviews. All are technical questions. They are very basic related to Tree and Integer. Make sure your code is bug free which I think is the point I got the offer.

A recruiter called me to see if I'd be interested in a job on the applications engineering team at Facebook. After an hour long conversation, he asked me 10 basic unix questions like "Tell me the command to display the routing table." and then submitted my answers to the hiring manager. I then did a followup interview where they wanted to bring me in for another interview. The only problem…  was that they wanted me to write syntactically correct code on a whiteboard for an hour. Given that I'm not a programmer and I have a job with better benefits than Facebook, I declined the offer.

**************************************User Experience Intern**************************************
Facebook came to our school, got pre-selected for an interview. Interviewed on campus, did not get interview.

**************************************Ad Sales Strategist**************************************
The overall interviewing process seemed rushed and Facebook does a poor job of communicating with potential candidates. A recruiter reached out to me and I scheduled a 30 minute phone screen. A few days later, I had a phone interview with the hiring manager. The manager asked questions regarding the industry, specifically about supporting an advertising sales vertical. The interviewer indicated that I had a strong background and would get…  back to me. I never heard back from either the recruiter or manager, even after sending follow-up emails. If the company is not interested, they do not reject you but simply blow you off. Totally unprofessional.

**************************************UX Researcher**************************************
Phone screen with recruiter, video conference interview with researcher focused on your favorite mobile app, an issue you feel it has, how you would research the topic and other hypothetical research situations, in person group presentation with team followed by 4 in person interviews with researchers focused on your past experience.

**************************************Marketing**************************************
Simple questions on background, examples of past experience and how you would be a good fit here, the recruiters were very friendly and prompt.I was not clear on what the hiring manager was looking for.

Great initial calls, in-person interviews I did not were handled well or professionally. I prefer not including exactly what this position was, but it was related to marketing. There were several phone interviews following a referral, then a round of back to back in-person interviews with a team lead and team members.The in-person rounds were not handled well - it seemed some of the interviewers were unaware they had the…  meeting that day. The interviews did not start on time, conference rooms were not booked correctly, and we were even asked to leave one of them mid-interview.I was highly qualified for the role and still work in the industry with FB teams regularly. I have interviewed for similar roles at other major companies in the space - but thought this was a very unprofessional experience.

Phone interview: Was called one day after submitting my resume. Very nice, recruiter but new very little about the actual position which made it difficult for me to show my value. She appeared to be very excited about my interest through multiple emails but did not hear back.

A friend referred me for the role, and the recruiter was quick to follow up with phone interviews and on-site interviews.

Probably my mistake for not doing my research. I was expecting the position to be a senior level position in the Marketing domain. However it appears they were looking for an individual contributor. After applying for the job when HR arranged a phone interview, I had all my charts and processes ready to talk about role of social media marketing and improving marketing effectiveness but the interviewer started asking me…  about coin toss probabilities. I was asked two question both turned out to be trivia questions. Now working in marketing analytics for over 10 years and spending 60 hours a week helping companies improve their marketing ROI, i clearly didn't see this coming. I didnt want to play along with this so told the interviewer while I can attempt to solve the permutation/combination questions I was not interested and rather look at the business side of the decision. At one point I felt like telling the interviewer to stop so that I could get back to my work. With my busy schedule, it was a tough ask for me to get 30 minutes for this conversation, wasting it like this was n't a smart move. Lesson learnt, I will be more careful next time around before applying and not apply just because I want to jump on Facebook so some other flavor of the month bandwagon.

Hands down the best most thorough interview process around. While the process varies from person to person and role to role, I experienced multiple rounds of phone screens, six onsite interviews, and a "hack" assignment. The process moved really quickly and they were keen on letting me know next to immediately that they were going to make me an offer.

I had applied online to Facebook through their site mid-July. However, only after I had applied and was interested in another position one week later, I was not able - exclusively because I had applied to another position previously. That was strike one.I was contacted in early August for a position at Facebook. I was asked to submit a lengthy evaluation, composing a mock response letter about fraud. Another two…  or three weeks later, a phone interview was scheduled. Still, the recruiter sent an e-mail at the time of the phone interview to reschedule for later in the afternoon. Later in the afternoon, the recruiter called late without apologizing for wasting prospective employees' time. The interview ran long, too. No hints during or after the initial phone interview concerning the next interview processes either.Over one week later, moving now into early September, a different recruiter was supposed to schedule an on-site visit to the Austin office. Never was told when or where to show up. Instead, I was contacted two days after I was supposed to have the on-site for yet another phone interview. In the confirmation e-mail, I was informed the recruiter would be from the Austin office. Nevertheless, when I asked on the phone specific questions about the office, I was told this recruiter was in California and had hardly an idea about the office. Still, the recruiter was very interested in me and wanted to continue the process. I followed up about one week later about the status of the next process and received no response. Again, another week later I called and received no return call. I was extended an offer by another company and pretty much forgot about Facebook....Until now...two months later....Now into November, I received a random e-mail from the first recruiter, whom I have not spoken to in over two and a half months. The note was the following:"Thanks for your interest in working at Facebook and apologies for the delay on getting back to you. We’re always on the lookout for the best talent and although we’re interested in your skills and background, it's not quite a fit for the positions that we have open right now."It is absolutely unacceptable for a company to wait over two months to send any correspondence about a recruiting decision. All in all, Facebook's recruiting process extremely unprofessional and inappropriate. It is unfortunate to see a prospering company not properly investing in the future of their company for the long-term.Strikes against Facebook:1. Ability to only apply to one position at time of application2. Unnecessary evaluation processes3. Miscommunication within the company4. Miscommunication with prospective employees5. Absurdly lengthy recruiting timelines6. Disrespectful, unprofessional, and inappropriate approach to interviews

I had a phone screen and 6 face-to-face interviews. The interview mostly behavioral. They asked me questions like: How will you prioritize tasks? Why Facebook? There were some questions where they tested my knowledge about some technical concepts. I thought that the interview went off well, but was not offered the job.

Interviewer and atmosphere appeared to be 'too cool for school.' The interviewer stressed the 'awesome' benefits like going out for drinks every week. Even mentioned a recent beer pong tournament. Felt very unprofessional. I tried to gather details about the actual job, but the interviewer was unhelpful and didn't have specific department goals.

1. Phone Interview: A general phone screen. Less than 15-30mins.2. Followed up by a face to face interview with 4 different persons from different roles, scheduled back to back, with a break in between. This process might take 3-4 hours so be prepared to spend possibly half a day interviewing.3. Did not manage to proceed to the next round which is supposedly a video conference call with Facebook HQ and…  then maybe another final round of interview before confirmation.

I had a HR screening process. They seemed a little bit messy. I had to remind him how he would proceed with the interview and what the process will be like. They never got back to me. After a week, I emailed the HR person and didn't get an answer back.

Got interview through an employee referral. Hiring manager emailed and scheduled interview herself. Pretty standard questions regarding my experience, skill set and online advertising. At the end of the interview, she suggested that she would send me a 'small project' to complete in order to get a sense of my capabilities. I agreed but never received anything from her. Followed up after a week or so, still no response.

Received an email asking for a phone interview and scheduled a time. Phone interview was fairly standard - mostly discussing my resume. Tips: if interviewing for a marketing position, prepare some marketing ideas as well as some comments/thoughts on improvements for the site. Interviewer was polite and friendly, overall the interview went for about 30mins.

**************************************Senior Software Engineer - Mobile**************************************
Recruiter contacted me via LinkedIn. Had 45 min call screen with them reviewing my experience. Was scheduled to come onsite for a 1:1 whiteboard coding interview. Both recruiter and engineering interviewer were very pleasant. Coding interview was focused on a single problem I was asked to solve and did not have much opportunity to discuss my experience and work history with an actual engineer - but thats partially because it…  took me so long to create the solution.

**************************************Small Business Sales Representative**************************************
I received an email after two weeks from my application in order to schedule an interview, replied within the day and never heard back (has been 3 weeks now).Incredibly unprofessional, I really did not expect such a rude treatment. At this point, I think you're just behaving as any big corporations, forgetting our initial values.

**************************************Program Manager**************************************
a) Recruiter screeningb) Phone interview with hiring managerc) 5 rounds of onsite interviews with hiring manager and peers..each for about 30 minutes with no break in between.Opportunities provided to ask questions about the role. Brevity is key. I could see the team getting bored by detailed answers

Very impressive and efficient interview process. The internal recruiter was extremely helpful and supportive. He was able to provide tips and tricks to make the process more successful. I am looking forward to hearing more from them in regards to additional interviews.

I think some parts of Facebook recruitment is questionable. For a PM role they ask technical questions that are not relevant info that ANY PM can get from the project team, Like system architect, etc. IF a company does not have smart SME for a PM to leverage then something is wrong.Either Facebook asks stupid interview question to reject candidates to they can justify to the government that they need H1…  visa for folks from India since they could not get the right person in USA, OR they are discriminating with age by weeding out older candidates with dumb questions.I can GUARANTEE you if you ask some very basic physics or science questions from high school to FB CEO or R&D director he will fail BEST hiring manager DONT ask technical questions, they know what they can do with the right candidate just by speaking with them. Stop discriminating and stop using silly interview tactics.

Applied through company portal. Contacted for initial recruiter screening, followed within 48 hours a phone screen with the hiring manger. After the a few days was invited to Menlo Park of an on-site interview loop. On-site I had 7 separate 45 minute interviews discussing my background and Facebook's current position and troubled areas. First interview was with the step-manager and final was a cultural fit interview. About one week after…  the loop had a follow up meeting with the hiring manager to close out open questions after which was advised that I would be offered the position.

I had a really positive overall experience during the interview and hiring process. My recruiter and hiring manager were so good at communicating next steps and they would follow up weekly to let me know where the team was at in the process. I had an initial phone interview, then fly out for an onsite interview in Menlo Park which was back to back interviews with four or five people,…  and then I had one last phone interview a few weeks later. The team I joined all emailed me when I accepted the offer congratulating me and welcoming me to the team, pretty awesome gesture and warm Facebook welcome. It really helped assure me I had made the right choice.

**************************************Expense Analyst**************************************
Can only speak as a contractor. Was contacted by a recruiter who set up the initial interview. I only interviewed once, met with two people then was offered the job a week later. They were desperate to fill the position.

**************************************Computer Scientist**************************************
You'll start out with a 55-minute interview. They'll be a short introduction that's followed by some problem solving (typically problems from InterviewBit or LeetCode). This is the most important part of the process. If you're slow or you stumble, then you won't get a call back.

**************************************Network Engineer**************************************
2 phone interview and followed by an onsite interview. I did not like the attitude of hiring manager but I enjoyed talking to other technical/non technical mems. No place is best place to work unless you connect with your boss and team mems. I have interviewed at many tech companies like google, microsoft and amazon but I never felt wasted my time applying the jobs or time spent during the…  interview preparation. This is 1st i felt like that I decided to never apply again in this life time

The interview process was good, I had five interviews calls, background checking and technical skills with good questions and scenarios. But after that I just got an email about end of process without any offer.

I applied on company career website. Got a call from facebook in 3 weeks. Had 2 interviews round. Interview co-ordinator was really helpfull explained in detail about interview. First interview was basic networking questions. Second was scenario based. Unfortunately I didn't got offer. But overall experience was really nice.

Passed through 3 phone interviews full of questions to test knowledge and understanding of networking and system performance. After last interview there was no response from Facebook recruiter. She wouldn't reply to e-mails nor return voicemails. Expect that if you spend that much time that there would at least be a 'thank you for your time but we are no longer considering you for the position we will keep your…  resume on file for future opportunities"

The entire process happened very quickly. I had applied online in January. I got a call from the recruiter midweek of March stating that she wanted to set up an interview. The coding interview was set up immediately after two days. It was a 45 minute coding interview. They basically targeted datastructures and algorithms.

1 hour remote phone hour interview. Highly technical, no personality or cultural questions. All they care about is technical capability, as you start contract, they don't care about personality. I was applying for a corporate network position, and only interviewed with one Infrastructure Manager who asked me a barrage of questions related to core networking concepts and application networking. It was a pretty in depth technical interview. The biggest red…  flag I should have realized is the manager described the environment at Facebook as sink or swim.. Which meant every man for themselves. There's no teamwork atmosphere at Facebook. I got the job and regret I did.

Great HR folks. Very co-operative and helpful.I had 2 technical phone screens with engineers and 2 phone calls with recruiters. All were very nice and smooth.They asked me to fly to their HQ in CA, I had 5 on site interviews and a lunch with the hiring manager.Out of 6 folks, 4 of them were very friendly and professional.1 of them was quite rude and the way I got that…  engineer's response to my questions and their body language assured me that I am not getting this job.The 6th person was from a different team and was a bit arrogant about the knowledge they acquired over the years and why they know a lot and I don't! that was my another sign of NOT getting this job.I was told by the recruiter right before I left FB's campus that the feedback is not positive.The travelling and reimbursement process is a bit tedious.

I was referred by a friend. We started with a 1:1 interview onsite because I am in the area. It was okay, and I probably blew the coding interview.Nonetheless they went on to schedule the site interview with 5 interviews. One weird thing is that they did not give me an agenda in advance. During the day, I have one discussion-type interview, two coding interviews and two system discussion interviews.…  Even during the system interviews, I was asked coding questions---probably because I am weak on that front.Overall, I get the impression that there are a fair amount of CS trained people interviewing me, expecting standard answers from the questions asked. There is very little emphasis on the ability to think and evaluate the situation independently. This is not atypical for a system catered for hiring masses of programmers to be fair to Facebook.Nonetheless, it is weird that I chatted with database people, people working on caches, etc., but never a networking person during the interview. I swear I told the HR that I am interested in a networking role. So, basically you don't meet your colleagues beforehand.Something to note about Facebook is that their NDA is quite one-sided. There was a clause about *owning your idea* that you talk about during the interview, which is unusual. I striked out the clause before signing the NDA.

They get in touch with me by LinkedIn, the recruiter from fb Singapore office for network Eng in to work in terra-graph project.First phone interview arranged in the next day by the recruiter, starting by introducing myself and my experience in the beginning I though it's only general question but the interview takes about 75 Min with some general technical question about Wireless, Networking and Linux.After 2 weeks the second…  technical video interview arranged with one network Eng from US office, the interview takes about 60 Min and covered technology such as networking, wireless and RF, the interviewer been very helpful and professional.Then after 2 weeks the 3rd video interview arranged with other network Eng from US office, this one been very bad and I consider it the worst interview I have done, the interviewer didn't open his camera and start questioning me in aggressive way about networking and he didn't gave me enough time to think even his questions not clear for me, this interview takes 20 Min only.After one week the recruiter called me and said unfortunately I have Not Ok feedback for you!!

Phone interview (basic technical questions, linux, python, networking) - 1 hrPhone interview (in depth networking questions) - 1 hrSkype interview (programming indepth - depends on your selected language preference) - 1hrFace to Face (dublin) - 5hrsAfter the face to face interview, you are given an offer to work at facebook.

J'ai passé 9 entretiens au total dont 2 par téléphone un par skype et 6 en face to face. L'entretien n'est pas très difficile. Très bon acceuil. L'équipe est sympa.J'ai eu la réponse finale après 2 semaines du dernier entretien.

**************************************Senior S/W Engineer**************************************
I applied through a referral working at in SF office. I was contacted by a recruiter about 10 days later.Recruiter was kind and professional. Before asking me about myself, he went on to good detailabout the company, the various teams and projects the team working on .He also added in case if I get on board, I would have the chance to with with each teamto get a sense of…  what it is like, then pick the team to work on later.

**************************************Inside Sales Account Executive**************************************
I initially applied online and it took them sometime to respond. Once I had my initial phone interview I was informed I'd have a 1x1 phone interview with someone in sales, that took some time to schedule as the recruiting team is somewhat slow to respond. After the second Phone interview I was told I would have a face to face interview with several folks in Austin on a particular…  date which would take about two hours. The questioning during the process was not really relevant and to be quite honest I don't think they were looking for qualifications but more at if the candidate was a cultural fit. I would think being facebook they would have asked some more difficult question to weed out the yahoos who applied.

**************************************Frontend Engineer**************************************
Communications first occurred with a 30 minute phone screening to determine if I would be a good qualifying fit. From there, I was contacted with instructions to complete a programmatic challenge to be written in JavaScript that was estimated to take between 8 and 10 hours time as solved by current Facebook employees. The challenge, at it's core, was intended for candidates to prove their programming chops. Facebook was looking…  for both succinct and optimized solutions, i.e. you better use the most efficient algorithm available while still maintaining very few lines of code. The problem I was asked to solve looked fairly easy at face value, but I soon realized a few hours in that there were numerous edge cases that needed to be accounted for and would drastically reduce my algorithms efficiency due to nested loops. I solved the problem with a sub-optimal solution in around the time required but was denied continuation of the interview process. I wasn't given any real feedback, but I didn't ask for it either. The recruiter was very pleasant on the phone and in his emails.

**************************************Recruiting Lead**************************************
Phone Interview. 3 half hr back to back interviews. Typical behaviorals and questions related to advertising and how revenue can be made, system efficiencies, hypothetical scenarios regarding your role.

**************************************Data Scientist, Product Analytics**************************************
A recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn. I had a quick call with her to confirm my interest and then she set me up with a technical phone screen that same week. Because I did okay, not great, I had a second phone screen the following week. Then within another week or two I went in for an onsite interview with 5 different team members ranging from analyst to…  manager. The interview was on a Friday and by Tuesday, I believe, they had gotten back to me with a no - but they softened the blow by letting me know that I was a good fit, but that my technical skills weren't quite there, so I should give them a call back in 6 months or when they are there, whichever comes last.Overall the people I interviewed with were very cool and supportive (one exception, but there always is, isn't there?) In the end, I don't actually think I was qualified for the position, but had I been, I most likely would have taken the role. The only negative for me really was the workspace - the entire office is one room.Both phone screens were the same format. They start by telling you about the role, ask you to describe your experience and then they jump right into a case, which also serves as a SQL exercise. They provide you with a sample schema then ask you to write queries against it and answer some strategic questions about how you might think about the output or what conclusions you could draw from the metrics available to you (or those you might create.) Overall for someone who uses SQL regularly (which I do) this was very easy - though I will say if you are not familiar with the format, where you code live (which I wasn't) it can throw you off. All of the queries I saw in the phone screen and the onsite interview relied a lot on COUNT and self joins and other nested queries, so if you feel you might be nervous you could review those concepts.I was really happy with the onsite interview, it was even a little bit fun, but I really didn't know what I was doing half the time, so that was a bit awkward. What I liked the most was that it was almost 100% skill based, none of the "tell me about a time when" or "what's your greatest strength" nonsense that I'm used to.The first interview was a business case. I was asked what kind of metrics I would look at, how I would track them, what conclusions I might draw from different scenarios. It was basic, but they were looking for some specific insights so I would say even though it was open ended, there were right and wrong answers.The next interview was a SQL interview. It was a lot like the phone screen, just more involved.The following interview was Python/R based and asked me to write a couple of algorithms. I don't actually know Python/R so I did pretty badly! But it's a testament to the culture (or at least the kindness of this one guy) that he was not rude about it, just tried to give me some coaching and be friendly while I wrote a lot of non-sensical things on the whiteboard. Since then I have taken Coursera's R Programming course and I would say that if you pass that class you should be able to pass this interview - though perhaps if you fly through the first couple of algorithms they get progressively harder in which case the class may not be sufficient.The next interview was a probability question. I had done a ton of probability prep based on the reviews I saw on Glassdoor but he really knocked me over with a question that I had no idea how to answer. Bayes rule what? That was not at all relevant in this case, sadly.The final interview was another case, or so it seemed, but actually I think it was more of a test of my stats 101 knowledge, which I didn't quite pick up on right away. The interviewer asked me a kind of confusing question which I thought was a bit of an analysis question, but really he was asking me: "what is standard deviation?" but in the most round about, muddled way possible. He also had a thick accent and was very stern which didn't help. So I actually think I did the worst on this (even worse than the Python/R which I didn't even know!), which is funny because I know stats very well, but that's how it goes.Overall I would say I was very unfamiliar with this style of interview. I have an MBA so I had done a lot of less technical interview prep. However it seemed very fair and very manageable... if you actually know the material.

**************************************Sourcing Analyst**************************************
emailed my resume to a recruiter, contacted by another recruiter. Got a phone interview. I've been asked some of the questions that I was not expecting, like how to motivate yourself, have you ever went above and beyond your current job responsibility. There was also a question about your relationship with your current supervisor.

**************************************Fraud Analyst**************************************
I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter via email about a month after I applied online. She asked me if I would be available during a specific time. I acknowledged that I would be and set the date and time. Right on time when the phone interview we scheduled she called. She explained what Facebook's goal in Austin would be, explained the position and proceeded to let me explain a…  bit about myself. She then asked me several questions and provided me with a change to ask her questions. She didn't seem to have very many of my answers, but I am sure she wasn't familar with the context of some of my questions so those will be bettered asked for later in the process. She then explained what the rest of the interview process would be and that she would be forwarding on my resume to the hiring team.

**************************************Recruitment Administrator**************************************
This was the 1st fase of the recruitment process. I applied online, through the Facebook Careers Website, and I was contacted, some days later, by e-mail, asking me to participate in an phone interview one by one. The lady I spoke to was very nice and the interview did not last longer than 30 min.

**************************************Escalation Specialist**************************************
After applying online, there was first call from HR. It took around 30 minutes, and was about my background and the reasons for choosing Facebook and this position. Then I had another call with a team member. After that, I had 5 video conference interview with 5 different people related the position. Everyone was very positive, sincere and interesting to chat. I got a call from HR and they informed…  that I got positive feedback from everyone. However, they choosed someone internal and directed me other available position at the company.

Overall process took 1.5 months. I have applied online for this role and a recruiter got in touch with me (She was really helpful during the interview process and i was given timely updates and feedback.)1. Recruiter Call (Know your CV and why you want this company and role), 2. Call with someone from the team(behavioural and experience related questions), 3. Call with the team in US (peer and manager)…  4. Meeting with a peer &manager & stakeholder 5. Decision.I was asked about my previous experiences and had to provide examples in all interviews as i was in a very similar role at that time.I got an offer but declined as the package was very similar to what i had and there was no change after i asked for a re-review.

**************************************Regional Manager**************************************
8 interviews in total - 3 onsite in Dublin and the rest over VC - took a long time to get an offer but they were thorough and it gave both sides the time needed to make a decisionEveryone was friendly and I felt like they were thorough in their questions - I got a real sense that they wanted me to get the job!

**************************************Marketing Principal**************************************
I was emailed out of the blue from a recruiter who saw my resume online. He was really nice and motivating about the impact of the job. Then i was scheduled for a phone screen. The interviewer showed up late and then rushed through very high level questions. It was almost as if they didn't know what questions to ask. I was then flown out to their HQ in Palo…  Alto...it was the most disorganized and hectic onsite I've ever been on. First, my second interviewer was a no show since he was out of the country. Seriously? You didn't know the interviewer would be in Europe for my onsite? Then, they kept me through lunch but didn't feed me anything - which is rude. Either don't interview through lunch or take the candidate out for an informal. Otherwise, they get queasy and hungry, like I did.So, after all the onsite interviewing, they told me it looked really good and that I should hear back from them within 2 days. An offer was imminent.However, in 2 days, they told me they wanted to look at other candidates and then proceeded to jerk me around for 2 weeks. The hiring mgr even called me to do a follow up interview (even through he'd already grilled me in person). It's like they didn't know what they wanted or how to go about a professional recruiting regime.Finally, they made me an offer and acted like they were focused only on me from the beginning. Their tune changed and I found it to be disingenuous. Also, the offer compensation was insulting. Esp for an expensive place like Palo Alto. I was also interviewing with another large tech company that made me an offer and beat Facebook's offer by 30%. Now, looking back on it, this was a fantastic decision and no regrets. Their stock price has bottomed out and that was a large part of my compensation. Also, the company is so flat that the opportunities for career growth were nonexistent.

**************************************Market Specialist, Community Ops**************************************
Quick phone screen first, then phone interview with two members from respective team, last round with a quick presentation about the market you are applying for and 3 interviews in a row with different team members/managers.The overall process went very quick, effective and people make you feel very welcome and are very friendly so that the interview experience does not feel pressuring at all.

**************************************Sales Engineer**************************************
Two phone interviews that were pretty basic and standard. There were a lot of questions about how does Facebok work, experience using Facebook, etc. After a couple of weeks I went to Facebook's campus and had 3 in-person interviews. 2 of the 3 were technical interviews. Both of the technical interviews involved problem solving and drawing solutions on a whiteboard. The other interview was a business development type interview. That…  one involved a lot of questions about how I thought Facebook could improve, how could they monetize, etc. In all the questions were fair and the people I met with were very nice. It would have been an exciting opportunity, but unfortunately, it didn't work out.

Received an inquiry from a recruiter after sending resume. Basic questions about Facebook's business and my background. Was followed with by another recruiter who setup technical interview. Consisted of writing psuedo code to perform basic functions. Other questions about troubleshooting API issues and how you would go about it. Next step would have been an onsite but don't think I will get that.

**************************************Recruitment Scheduler**************************************
After applying online, I was contacted within a couple of days by an internal recruiter to arrange a phone screen. I was then invited to an onsite interview where i was interviewed by two of the recruitment team (15 min each) and was then given a written exercise to complete at the end (30 mins). I was left waiting in the meeting room on my own for a while which…  made me a bit uncomfortable because I didn't know what to expect, waiting for the next interviewer/if they had been talking about how my interview was going with the previous interviewer.Overall I enjoyed the experience and was given a tour of the office at the end of my interview. Everyone seemed friendly and the office is in a great location.I would recommend having a good clear answer for why you want to work there and some examples to back up your opinions on the company or what the job will be like - I was asked that question in the phone screen and it came up again in the interview. I think they look for your knowledge of the product/brand as well as the company as an employer i.e. what you can offer them and what attracted you to apply there over other tech companies.After a couple of days the recruiter contacted me with interview feedback and the outcome to le me know they weren't progressing with my application - there would have been a second round interview before an offer was made.

**************************************Corporate Network Engineer**************************************
Made my way to Facebook HQ for the grueling 5+ hour interview process. Met head recruiter, and introduced me to the first interviewer, who was from a different part of the organization, they said they wanted to get a perspective of me from someone on the "outside" What? Next person was the toughest. Instead of interviewing me, he basically wanted to show me exactly how much "he" knew about each…  topic. We spent more time going over what he knew, rather than how much I knew! Next couple of interviewers were very nice and asked "reasonable" questions, which I answered correctly. There were only a few that I said I would have to come back to, which I did and again I answered them correctly! I then met with the group manager, who was very nice, not technical at all, but asked me situation type questions about conflict management. You know the questions about how you handle tough people who think their ideas are the "only" good ideas, and other similar questions. So, overall I know for a fact the first interviewer had his mind made up even before we started the interview; arms crossed, stern look, higher-than-thou attitude. I didn't get the job, even though everyone else wanted to hire me, the first interviewer had it in for me for sure. The manager even asked me if I need to give the standard two week notice and basically asked when I could start. So I was shocked when i got the "we have no position to offer you at this time" email.

**************************************Develop Support Engineer**************************************
Have two rounds interviews, one is general technique interview with a screen sample coding test. Second is onsite interview by three different interviewers. The first one was easy, and second one was not difficult, but they just wanted to find top persons....

**************************************Sourcer**************************************
Connected with a Recruiter through a Facebook employee. The recruiter sent my resume on to another recruiter who got in touch with me regarding the fb sourcer/ recruiter bootcamp.

Very casual. Did not feel like an interview. Many questions and conversations were about experience with some light behavioral questions. Be sure to tie in cultural values into explanations and stories

Good group of interviewers- easy to speak with and informative. Quick response times which made for a painless experience :)Enjoyed meeting the team and being shown around their space. Hope to touch-base again in future.

**************************************Ad Operations**************************************
Two telephone interviews followed by 3 interviews at their european headquarters in Dublin. The whole process from start to finish was flawless. I have attended over 20 interviews and assessment centres and this is by far the best process. Interviewers were very friendly and created an environment within the interview that allowed me to perform to my best.

**************************************Media Operations Contractor**************************************
3 rounds with different people asking about past experience and situational questions. Most of it was very informal and conversational. Some people were given a writing test. Other questions were aimed at past experience and that would prepare you for the job. What's your favorite follow on Instagram was a fun question.

**************************************Developer**************************************
Retarded. The most useless way of interviewing people, don't bother with if you get an invitation because your chance is next to none. I had some guy interviewing me that didn't even bother reading my CV and had zero knowledge of my background. They give you 15min to solve a rather academic problem on a white board while they are breathing down you neck, you can never solve it that…  quickly since it requires a trick to solve - unless you work with recursions on a daily basis (who does in a professional environment ) ?

**************************************Analyst, Sales Operations**************************************
My initial contact with Facebook was a call from a recruiter to arrange a time for a phone screening. The recruiter was very friendly and helpful, and offered some more information about the details of the role. The initial phone screening was a more in-depth conversation with the same recruiter: we talked about my experience, my education, and my knowledge of Facebook's advertising model.Following that, we arranged another phone interview…  with the team leader. Again, we talked about my own experience, similar projects I worked on in the past, my knowledge of Facebook advertising and suggestions for how I would improve it. The team lead also gave me more hands-on knowledge of what the role required and asked how I would go about it.Finally, I was invited for a few hours of on-site interviews: a 1:1 interview with the department manager, a 2:1 interview with a couple of team members, another 2:1 interview with some other team members, and finally a presentation to the whole group. It could be a daunting experience but everyone was very encouraging and friendly.Unfortunately, the team felt I wasn't perfect for the role, so I wasn't offered the job. However, I got a great impression from the people I met and I'd happily apply for other roles with Facebook in the future.

**************************************Data Center Engineer**************************************
Great communication and scheduling with internal recruiters. Interviews were really positive and relaxed with challenging but helpful questions. Phone interview wasn't forced, felt natural and interviewers did a great job of clarifying questions as needed. Interviewers were open to questions about the position and willing to share details about the role and environment.

**************************************Compliance Analyst**************************************
very long, number of interviews, random questions about everything related to the company, talking to a vast number of people. Be prepared to be challenged with not expected questions such as " do you know who I am and what I do"?

**************************************Business Intelligence Engineer**************************************
Was a mix of technical and non-technical interviews. Great culture.Interviewers were very friendly. The interviews were more of a discussion than one sided questioning.Interviewers were also patient to answer how it is to work at Facebook, and how one can grow their career.

**************************************Software Engineer, Infrastructure**************************************
The recruiter from Texas was very kind, very friendly and very helpful. I passed the phone interview using collabedit.com. Then I had an onsite interview. The first interviewer asked me to code this problem: Write a function that takes 2 arguments: a binary tree and an integer n, it should return the n-th element in the binary tree in the inorder traversal. I struggled quite a bit. but got it…  right in the end. The second interviewer asked some network monitoring questions. He was not impressed. Then there was a fire alarm. Everybody vacated the building. A few days later, I was told that I was no longer a candidate.They never asked qeustions about my past experiences. I guess the strange culture lives on. As long as FB is doing OK, there is no reason to change. I suppose.

**************************************At Human Resources Diversity**************************************
It was a very laid back interview process. The best advice I could give someone is to answer all of the questions with full honesty because they will catch on that you're lying. The attire is dressy casual, so follow it. Be sure to show your manners that you would use when meeting your significant other's parents.

**************************************Recruiter**************************************
The interview was pretty straight forward. First phone interview was with the recruiter who reached out to me. Then, an onsite interview and although they said, they might have a follow-up interview, they called me the next day and said they'll be making an offer. The offer numbers came in very quickly thereafter. The entire process (from first recruiter contact to offer acceptance) took less than two weeks!

Not a great experience. While I met some nice people and for the most part it was pleasant overall, it was all for not when I got to my last interview and it was very unpleasant. In all fairness, I do terrible in interviews and I probably wasn't answering questions well.Over a 5 and a half week period I had 5 interviews (2 were rescheduled), 2 phone and 3 face-to-face.…  I was initially contacted about one position, but by the 3rd interview I was told that was not the position and it was a different one… For my 2nd phone interview it was rescheduled twice as they were never confirmed and they just phoned out of the blue. It seems, from my experience at least, the left-hand doesn't know what the right-hand is doing. Too many unnecessary moving parts for my liking, recruiter, administrator, coordinator… Much easier if someone picks up the phone and confirms a day and time?Walking into the building it definitely looks/feels like you have to drink the kool-aid before they let you pass! I fail already... I'm a square peg and don't fit in a round hole.Escorted everywhere, including the bathrooms! Which I kind of get, but a little over the top for my liking, especially waiting outside the bathroom door for me. Literally. Walking through the work spaces I don't get how work can get done in an efficient manner with staff sitting on top of one another. Oh yeah, don't even think about opening your personal laptop, which I made the mistake of pulling out and trying to power up in my interview… That was met with instant resistance and an accusatory what are you doing? There are no laptops! Didn't they go over that with you at the front desk? Nope.

It was a careful process.

Of the so many companies I have interviewed for, this was the first ever company who was more interested in my failures than in achievements. I know the intent would have been to know about my risk taking apatite and Learnings from it but starting the interview with such question as let's start with your failure makes you little jittery.I took 4 interviews and 3 out of them wanted to…  know about my failures and only 1 asked me about my achievements.The interview process took a longer time than usual and every time I had to follow up to get update on next steps.

From the initial conversation the process went really well, spoke with a super experienced recruiter who knew a lot about the team structure and was able to answer questions I had asked about the specific roles they hire for. Following the phone screen I was invited onsite, standard peer interview and met with 2 members of the management team which included a team lead.My conversation with the team lead was…  a little disappointing who said she was the first recruiter hired for FB Dublin - I was expecting a great conversation but found the interview a bit strange, she seemed disinterested in what I was saying, asked questions for the sake of it and couldn't answer a lot of basic things I asked around hiring targets, how my performance would be measuredMentioned a few times that there are a lot of women on the team, I felt that being male hindered my chances of joining her team. Interview ended very abruptly as she was late for another meeting.Overall, started well and ended really poorly from a candidate experience perspective.

Had 3 (from 4) interviews in total. face-to-face interview was the worse experience I've ever had in my life. One out of 3 interviewers had me waited for over an hour without telling me how long I had to wait. I ended up waiting for nearly 2 hours, and still the person didn't show up. I interviewed with the other 2 interviewers which one of the 2 had less experience…  and asked less challenging question. Honestly, I didn't expect the questions to be so simple. I would definitely get the same kinda questions from any company. One interviewer mentioned to me that facebook aims to give good interview experience to everyone they interview and at facebook we treat and respect everyone the same. Well...what a shame!

Phone interview then they subsequently arrange you to gave 4 rounds of interview session with the staffing leads, approx 30 min each in their office via vc. After th at your hiring manager will meet you again to discuss and ask some questions.

I was referred by an ex-colleague. The process was very quick, had an initial with the recruiter, then with a Recruiting Lead. After that I had another follow-up with a different recruiter as I was being considered for a different recruiter position. I was then invite to the offices and had 4 onsite interviews. Decision made and offer within 2 weeks. I was informed by the recruiter via phone that…  I received the job offer.

Five interviews in total. First round was a phone interview with the recruiter, the next was a phone interview with the business and then finally I had four face to face interviews.

The process started with a relatively informal call with a Recruiter who gave background on the opportunity and answered all my questions. Next stage was a screen with the Hiring Manager. Final stage was a 2 hour meeting onsite with 4 people on the team for 30 minutes each. Each interviewer covered a particular area and it was informal in style. I expected some crazy questions to be thrown in…  but it was all very straightforward and enjoyable. The Recruiter kept me up to date on the timelines and prepared for every meeting.

I had an initial phone screening with one of the recruiters. Within few hours she came back to me saying that she would like to proceed with me for the next stage. THis was a Skype interview with 4 people (2 recruiters-out of which one was the initial prescreener, 1 recruitment lead, 1 line manager from a team) She called me within 2 days saying that I was not the…  winner for the position. Overall it was very professional from her and I think they are quite quick.

The interview process was very quick and the person I talked to was professional and convincing - being honest about working & living in Dublin. I liked it since both qualities are important aspects in recruiting.They are clearly looking for a good team fit and dynamic individuals that bring in fresh ideas.

Seemless. It seemed I was being sold the role more than I was interviewing for it. I had a phone interview with my manager to be. Then I was called to the office and met 4 people for 30 minutes each. All were very friendly and energetic. They seemed genuinely excited to meet me and enthusiastic about their jobs and the company they worked for.

**************************************Avionics Systems Engineering**************************************
I was invited for a phone interview around 3 weeks after applying online. The interview itself was very interesting, with some technical questions on embedded systems, sensors, and robotics. Was promised an answer in 2 weeks, only got it months after the interview after sending a few emails to the recruiter.

**************************************Product Marketing Manager**************************************
Intensive interview process. I had one phone interview, then product exercise, two face to face. They dig a lot about team and cross-functional complexities. The hiring manager focuses more on big picture and strategic questions and peers dig into tactical examples from your background. Overall, I loved the experience and learnt a lot in the process. I hope I can work at FB in future.

Applied through an employee referral. Recruiter circulated my resume for various roles and several hiring managers expressed interest. Interviewed for 1 role with hiring manager by phone, brought in for onsite with 5 folks. Recruiter thoroughly prepped me on the role & structure of questioning.

I submitted an application online for two roles. I was contacted by a recruiter for one of the roles and she scheduled a phone interview. The phone interview lasted 30 minutes during which the recruiter described Facebook culture and benefits and asked me some standard interview questions. I did not get much of an opportunity to ask my own questions due to the time allocated. I wish I had been…  more assertive within the context of each interview question.

Was contacted by a recruiter after I applied online. Very prompt recruiter with excellent turnaround time. After one telephonic interview with the hiring manager, I was called onsite for a set of 4 interviews with hiring manager, the head of department, one colleague and one more person.Great set of interviews and very smart conversations. Questions were centered around the industry, how will I add value. Questions probing past experience and…  how that can be applied to the new role. I would suggest to do some good research about all Facebook products as that really helps.I was contacted after the onsite to have a final video call with some colleagues but I had two offers in hand, so I said no. My choice was dictated also by my personal situation else I would have definitely considered Facebook as my first choice.

The recruiter reached out to me by email after seeing my resume on LinkedIn and finding my resume on FB's database - previous internal referral. We scheduled a call and had a brief conversation about the position and about Facebook. I was very interested in the position - Platform PMM - and decided to go on-campus to interview with the PMM team.When I got to the FB campus I was…  greeted by the recruiter, who showed me around the campus. I was pretty impressed. Cool graffiti painted walls, all open space, multiple eating and dining areas, open bars in each building. Then I met with the interviewers, two PMM's who made me feel comfortable from the beginning. I had two half hour interviews focused on:- Their hiring needs: organizational needs, positions they were hiring for and what those positions entailed.- My professional experience: they asked a couple of questions about what I do and about some of the steps I took in my career.- Case study / brainstorming product improvements. We focused specifically Facebook Login and App Install Ads. This was the most challenging part and the most interesting as well. Even though I prepared a lot for the interview, I guess I did not do as well as I thought. :)Overall, the whole process took about two weeks. I believe I would fit with the culture and could see myself working with the interviewers. Unfortunately I did not pass to the next round, but had a great time!

The interview process can seem disorganized - probably because they interview so many people it's hard to keep track of the schedule. I had 2 phone interviews, both with Product Marketing Managers. They asked questions you would expect: Why do you want to work at FB? What do you want to work on at FB? What's your favorite FB app and why? How would you improve your favorite application?After passing…  the phone interviews, they brought me out for an on-site interview. I met with 3 PMMs - one interviewer was late and there was general confusion about the interview schedule. But in general, every one was very nice. The work environment is open, casual, and dynamic. Every one seems genuinely happy to be there. One word of advice: there aren't any tough interview questions to help separate you from the pack, so I think you need to be prepared to step it up during the interview and impress them on your own. Clearly, I didn't receive an offer so this is just my guess.

30-minute phone screening interview and a face-to-face interview.The process was a joke. For the phone screen, I was asked to dial in to a common number. Interviewer did not show up. Claimed that he dialed in too and did not find me.Subsequent interview proceeded as planned. Then had a decent 1-on-1 with the hiring manager. After 2 months of no news, I enquired on the outcome. Was told that they…  decided to change the job scope of the vacancy and hired someone else.

I did 6 interviews over the span of 1 month and a half from initial phone screen to the final interview. The recruiting team was very facilitative and helped move me through the process as smoothly as they could. All hiring managers were really smart and were very friendly. They asked broad enough questions to get any candidate thinking while still being relevant within the scope of the interview. They…  also replied respectfully when asked questions at the end of the session. It was overall a gratifying experience even if I don't end up working for them

Started with email appointment to call. Then call lasted about 10 mins asking if I knew which job I'm applying, why I wanna the job and what I can do to make it better.

**************************************Business Operations Manager**************************************
This was a very long interview process which consisted of:1) Phone Interview with HR2) 3 Phone Interviews with employees at facebook leading the different areas which the position would report into - 1 in California, 1 in New York, 1 in Ireland3) 1 Phone interview with hiring manager4) 1 on 1 interview with hiring manager5) 1 on 1 interview with head of Latin America Operations6) phone interview with country manager…  in ArgentinaThe communication was always very good and the interview process was enjoyable, albeit long. In the end I wasn't an exact fit for the position they were looking for.

**************************************Atlas**************************************
After being screened by HR, the interview process encompasses a discussion with the hiring manager and a "loop" of interviews by potential colleagues, each of which focus on a different trait / skill.The "loop" interviews were set up in 30 minute intervals, some done in-person and some through video conferencing at their office. The fact that each interviewer focused on a different trait / skill meant that you were able…  to have diverse conversations and not just repeat the same basic info each time. Only drawback is that I found you really needed 45 min or so with each person without it feeling rushed. I like that each interviewer had to provide feedback to the hiring manager and HR.

**************************************Department Head**************************************
I only had the initial telephone screening, which was a hassle to set up because the recruiter kept being late or had to move the timing. The conversation itself was fine and mostly covered my background, salary expectations and availability. I never heard a peep after that in spite of following up.

**************************************Online Sales Operations**************************************
Asked really hard questions that required convoluted answers. There where no correct answers but rather your process on how you reached them. Interviewees did not seem interested in the process.

Interview experience was good. I felt as though i had the job when I left, but I guess I was wrong. They were interviewing several people on the same day. I could hear conversations in other rooms which made me feel uncomfortable during the in person interview. I found it distracting.

First I was asked to complete a online writing sample and was then contacted about having a phone interview. Phone interview consisted of questions about my experience, facebook, and how facebook stacks up to competitors (ie google, twitter, etc.)

I sent in my resume applying for the OSO Account Manager position in Austin. Two weeks later, I was contacted by HR and informed that they would like me to take a written test. At the beginning of the written test there are 5 basic questions and then a 60 minute test where one needs to answer three questions- With many advertisers and a small team to oversee them what…  are some scalable solutions to make sure they are adhering to policy, while also keeping advertiser satisfaction high?- Selling the ad applications of Facebook to a potential customer in a letter format- How would you convince a new user to advertise on FacebookI have been informed that they are interested in a phone interview with the HR which will last 30 minutes. Awaiting future steps

After I sent in my resume, I was asked to do a 60 minute writing exercise in which I had to answer 3 questions. i then had a quick interview with an HR rep who just told me about the company and the position i chose. then asked me a little about my past experiences. i am scheduled for the next interview and waiting for it.

Asked to complete 30 min online test consisting of 2 questions and 1 phone interview. Phone interview consisted of a few questions about why I was right for this job and previous employment. Called for on site interview in a few weeks. Waiting to hear from them regarding details.

After I sent in my resume, I was asked to do a 60 minute writing exercise in which I had to answer 3 questions. questions involved, why facebook, how would you persuade a new user to advertise with facebook, and if u wud allow tobacco advertisements. i then had a quick interview with an HR rep who just told me about the company and the position i chose. then asked…  me a little about my past experiences. i am scheduled for the next interview and waiting for it.

There were two standard phone interviews. The first one was by a recruiter who wanted to tell me more about the job and had very little questions. The second phone interview consisted of speaking with one of the senior team members whose questions consisted of advertising policy and comparisons with competing advertisement options. Questions about your previous work history is a given.

The process is lengthy, I had 5 interviews and one case study. Onsite and phone interviews. Prepare basic case questions and info about competitors. Plus it's good to prepare well on their products.

I had applied for a Leads Analyst and after a month, got a call saying they liked my resume and would want to consider me for another opening, as this particular post has been filled up. I said i would be willing to go ahead with that as my resume and skill set matched both profiles; exceeded in fact. Anyway, as I'm a fresher, i wanted to go for the…  Online Sales Operations Analyst post and was excited about the whole process.I had to take an Online test, which after submission was reviewed and i got a call back saying i should not have listed points in one of the answers, so i need to phrase it in a paragraph. My content and style was appreciated, but they needed to be sure. I took this test again and was announced of clearing it. This process itself took more than 2 weeks i suppose.Then, i was asked various things and briefed a little by the Recruiter, after which i was told i have two more rounds to go through. I waited patiently for the call on the mentioned date and time. I cleared it and then was informed to be going to the next round. The next call was scheduled after a week or so. I did not receive one and had to inform the Recruiter, who got back to me immediately. Cleared that round too. Then i was called again to say i have one more round to go through. I did, cleared it. Then one more. I really did not get the point of talking the same things time and again, but i obliged, probably getting better each time.Owing to the public holidays that do occur now and then, the Recruiter does not attend, say, 3 days before and after the holiday. EACH TIME. i have had to wait for ten days at a time to receive a mail from her saying that she is not at office. And then more waiting! Also, i do not receive confirmation mails of the Interview being scheduled or other info. I have to personally ask every time about an ascertainment.Oh and ya, one time there were 'Internal Problems' that they were dealing with, due to which they did not reply for weeks.All this done, with the last interview results pending, which i had done exceptionally well, i had the Recruiter disappearing once again. I finally received a reply to my mail saying she's yet again not in the office and she will be back in a week and let me know. Glory be!I waited for that fateful day and was waiting for a call, as i was so dead sure i would be selected. Instead, i receive a mail, saying that my interview has been impressive and so is my CV, but owing to the large volumes of interview conducted, i do not match the skill they are looking for. "Unfortunately", they would not be taking it forward, it seems. I was polite and asked them the reason as a personal inquisition and rectification if possible, but all i got was a reminding of the 'Company Policies' that they seem to follow to death and how they cannot divulge in more information. Seriously?I thanked them for the experience and the process. Whatever it was, the Recruiter was well mannered and helpful, compared to the other Recruiters out there.I did not take up 3 more jobs that came my way and did not apply anywhere else, thinking i suited the profile and also the interview went well. I know i was a fool in doing so, but heck, a major mistake; probably due to the confidence of my performance and my profile.I do not see the point in withholding the results and the information for such a long time or conducting so many rounds of interviews. As far as i can see it, it was not a stage wise interview or level clearing process. Because, i do not see myself getting evicted in the last round after talking the same things, that too in a better and more confident way after facing off so many rounds.The highlight was that i was told i would be asked questions about the industry and about the operations. I was asked NONE. Everything was about how and why things are so and so in life and plausible probability of some non existent situation. All that research and knowledge about FB and its functions went down the drain. Well, knowledge gained. . .

I was approached by a senior US head office based recruiter and she saw my CV on one of the Indian job boards. I was asked in the email if I was interested and I replied positively. After this, she emailed me again in 2 days and asked me to take an English test and also said that once I pass the test satisfactorily, she will schedule time with me…  to speak.I seemed to pass the test and then I get a call from her during which she asked me about my expected salary straight away and also told me afterwards to expect only in a certain range. After a 0.5 hr chat, I was told she is happy with me and that I have progressed to the next stage! In about 10 days, I get a call from Hyderabad office without anyone scheduling my time. Afterwards, an HR person from India contacts me and agrees to schedule a call which she did.However, I did not receive a call from the person I was supposed to - a masterstroke. This telephonic round went well too and in about 1.5 weeks, I contacted this HR person about feedback and she says that I have progressed further and schedules another telephonic round. I get this call and it went very well; having answered most questions in the best possible way.The real thing starts now. After the 3rd round happened, I waited for another 10 days and only then emailed my HR contact about feedback. I get a reply saying that the guy has not given feedback yet and that she will come back on this in 2 days. However, more than 7 weeks passed since then and I am still chasing for feedback and no on even cares to reply.What a pity and what a waste of time. Even smaller companies with brand value no where close to Facebook know the value of potential employees.Very, very disappointed with them. Not because they did not select me, but because I was kept waiting for a deserving feedback.

four rounds of interviewindividual people to interviewwhen thru with one level, other interviewer takes next roundv friendly atmosphereall HR kind of questions- conflict, new product, how to you deal with others, wht new ideas, given a situation how do you react

Just had the first round for recruitment, submitted my resume online. Was contacted by an HR manager within 2 weeks for a written test. Now, scheduled for a telephonic interview in the coming week.

The pros: really smart questions during all 1:1 interviews, very cross-functional selection of interviewers (which gave me a great perspective on what the company culture is like), every on site interview provided a sense that the employees have fun at work.The cons: highly disorganized recruiting process and scheduling; several key interviewers who were scheduled didn't show or had to be subbed; recruiting took forever to give feedback and progress the…  interviewing schedule, which tied up other commitments I was making in my overall job search.

I sent in my resume after a month I was contacted by a recruiter. They asked me to take a 30 minutes, 2 question written test on advertising on Facebook. After the written test, they contacted me about my graduation timeline. Then we went to a phone interview. They asked why facebook? What are you strengths and weaknesses?

Sent in resume. I was then asked to complete a 60 minute writing test which consisted of 3 questions. Then I had a short phone interview with an HR person. I'm scheduled for an on-site interview soon. I was told i would also be asked to complete an on-site test.

I had a phone call from the company after I sent my resume through the internet application and then I had an interview by phone. After the first interview I had another round by phone and a final interview in face to face that was a really great expertience for me

**************************************Sales Representative**************************************
Interviewed at FacebookInterview Details – Had one phone interviewer with HR, one phone interview with hiring manager, and then an on-site interview with four people on the team. The four in-person interviewers were either at the same level as the role I applied for or more junior. They did not seem prepared and simply asked questions as they come up, so I basically answered the same set of questions four…  times in a two-hour period.

The process was short and resolved quite quickly. I applied online, had a very quick follow up, less that 2 days I received an email. Had a couple of interviews in the office after a HR phone interview. People were very casual and the initial conversations with very relaxed.

**************************************Senior Recruiter**************************************
They sent me a mail and asked for my resume. Then at the day of the meeting, the recruiter was very gentle, asked me about myself, my work experience and also wanted to know about my personality. Then he tried to evaluate my capacity to solve logical problems

**************************************Director**************************************
It was quick, organized and helpful in determining if I wanted to work there. They had me meet with the key people that I would be working with and did not require me to meet with a bunch of additional folks.

**************************************Account Manager SMB**************************************
Initially contacted by a recruiter for phone screening, 30 mins late, due to Facebook fun day, but there's no documentation of that event on their career page which is weird,But otherwise went ok.

Got referred by a FB employee and received an email within 2 weeks from a recruiter with information about a phone interview. Phone interview consisted of usual questions about myself, the role and FB (nothing unexpected) and also a case. Got feedback within a week that I am invited onsite, which was fully arranged by FB. Had four additional interviews. Overall, really good atmosphere, nice people and good organisation.

I had three interviews. The first one phone interview by phone with the recruiter, second with an head of SMB account management and the third round was in Dublin. I had to say that it was smooth process until I arrived to Dublin, three interviews not easy at all. Very analytical and I can't said more bc I signed a Non disclosure.

Just got to the first interview, the recruiter was very polite and nice. He saw how nervous I was and chatted for couple of minutes to give me time to relax, followed simple questions. I was too nervous anyways and it didn't go too good, but only my own fault. Good luck guys!

1 screening call from recruiter - next 30 min with manager - next onsite interviews with 3 different managers. Very pleasant experience from start to finish. Recruiters help with preparations for each interview.

**************************************Applications Operations**************************************
The interview process was fairly straightforward, though extremely slow. A single phone interview before being brought onsite. Apparently I was brought onsite and skipped a phone interview.The interview at Facebook's University Ave site was a bit odd. Employees are crammed in like sardines. More packed than most startups. It was very loud.I went through two sets of in-person interviews (a total of five or six people). The interviewers had extremely…  good / difficult interview questions. Nearly all the people I spoke with seemed extremely disinterested by the interview process. It was very difficult to figure out what working there would be like.

**************************************Growth Manager Africa**************************************
Had several interviews, all on phone. I was interviewing for this role with Facebook's new Internationalization (i18n) team. I sat in for two phone interviews, both conducted by the same person and got a regret email after the two interviews. It was hard to make out the interviewer's accent, but I did my best to answer all questions that he asked. It sounded like a great position to work in,…  I am sure whoever got/gets it will thoroughly enjoy the work.

**************************************Senior Software Engineer**************************************
First, I was contacted by the company recruiter through LinkedIn, then I had a phone conversation with some technical questions, next, I got a screen interview. You can take either online or in person. Since I was only 15 minutes drive from Facebook, I took it in person; within two days, I was invited for the onsite interview that took almost a day including free lunch there. They asked me…  if I want more time to prepare the interviews. I said I wanted the interviews soon. In respective, it was a mistake on my side. I did not prepare enough.

After an initial phone call, you will do a 1 hour online coding exam with another developer. If you get past this stage, they will invite you onsite. You will talk with 5 different people with questions around coding and design.

I was contacted by a recruiter, and scheduled a phone screen at my convenience. Apparently they hire with no job in mind and you are to find a specific job after being blessed as worthy. The phone screen happened on time and the interviewer was polite. This is a very low bar, I realize, but after a few interviews at companies where these basic logistics were badly screwed up, this…  was sadly a pleasant surprise.

recruiter was efficient and helpful, the interview was over the phone with a technical female, she was not that friendly.typical questions, that are good for someone that just graduated, they give you material to prepare but for someone that is busy as me, is difficult to find time for it. it doesn't measure the experience that you have with software development as myself coding on c++, java, python for the…  last 17 years and successfully delivered applications on different industries

I was solicited by FB recruiter through LinkedIn. I followed up given my perception of FB being fast pace and open culture. After PS, I went on-site which contains the standard 5 rounds: behavioral & culture fit; coding; coding; design; design.I was never a fan of behavioral questions and never felt such questions are inspirational, FB is no difference. There was a quick 10-minute coding problem near the end of…  this round --- you have no time to think but just to code it up. The first coding problem is simple but a little tedious to write code. The second coding problem is medium difficulty with two parts. The first part is simple and I quickly code it. I had to think about the second part to identify the algorithm but had no time to implement it.In both design rounds, despite the interviewer’s claim that the problem is opened-ended without perfect answer, and what’s important is the thought process, he didn’t really mean it --- a solution that perfectly matches what the interviewer had in mind is expected. The interviewer, graduated from school a few years back, does not have rich project experiences to handle deviations from his standard solution. The interviewer simply likes to move fast on the track of his solution. Any deviation from that track becomes a distraction instead of part of true problem solving process.Overall I am disappointed with FB interview process. The FB interview loop obviously not really evaluate and identify true problem solving skills or experiences but just how fast you can write bug-free code for simple algorithm problem with little or no time to think. It effectively requires that you have coded the same or very similar problem very recently. I am confident on my coding and problem solving skills and like to present the daily true me instead of an interview-prepared me.FB hires lots of young graduates and expect them to write fast code. Maybe coding fast and breaking things is fine for web pages, but I suspect how terrible their back-end infrastructure would be due to the code fast mentality.

The process as such is standard. Three interviewers were good. The other two I felt had some solution in mind, and wanted me to approach the exact same way.Its almost as if they expect one to mug up a solution and produce the output. There is absolute no room for creative thinking. The interviewer does not work with the interviewee to produce a better solution, instead expects to bark text…  book answers. Interview should not be a place where in, the skills are judged based on the number of lines of code and code beautification, but instead one should try to evaluate the skills based on thinking and approach taken. I was totally disappointed by the process.

Recruiter contacted me on LinkedIn. We set up initial telephonic chat. Followed by two telephonic interviews. Both were coding and Algorithms related. I didn't do well with first one, I got feedback saying I was slow in providing response. Because of my background they kindly gave me another chance, which I did Ok. Then followed by on site. I wanted to do well in on site so I took a…  while to prepare and scheduled interview date almost 3 weeks after . I practiced 100+ questions on LeetCode. I also studied large scale system design questions. It's like practice daily 2 hours just for this interview. This is really helped to come up with solutions during on site interview. The on site consists of 2 coding & algorithm questions, 2 design questions and 1 behavior + coding. Except first coding question, because of interviewer poor communication skills, I did n't completely understand what's the problem, in all other rounds I gave my best. After waiting for almost 2 weeks I got a feedback saying they are passing my application. I guess my best is not enough for them. Sometimes even though you prepare well, some factors make you unfit for job, that's a fate. Any case overall I've great experience and get a chance to visit FB campus. As some one mentioned here looks like FB is not giving offers to any SE candidates since Jan 2016 despite people are doing good in interviews. Of course if we think we are doing good that doesn't mean interviewers are also thinking same.

I submitted my resume and communicated with HR a few times before an on-line interview was set up. The interview problem was not hard. I quickly gave some solution but the interviewer pushed for a better one - better in time and space complexity. Very reasonable request. I did not do well enough to get an on-site interview.

I am a woman engineer with experience applying for a Senior Sw Engineer position. Recruiter contacted me initially. She was allowed me to postpone screen as needed, as I wanted to prepare a little more on the algorithmic side, and I did. I went in person rather than phone. The interviewer was nice and the problem was moderate to difficult (involving trees) for a phone screen. This was my first…  time resolving it. Although it took me some time, I did give a solution that the interviewer was satisfied with, we had time for questions, for finding out what he was working on at the moment. I got out feeling good and confident. I received a disappointing automatic message with rejection. I asked for feedback but did not receive it. I felt confused and upset that Facebook didn't give me a chance for on site. There aren't many women engineers in high tech, and walking on the floor at Facebook there is evidence there aren't there either. Given Sheryl Sandberg's vocal support of women and my satisfactory screen, I would have hoped that the company tries to do much more in their own backyward, to change the status quo regarding gender imbalance in predominantly male roles at Facebook.

A rather long process, expect at least a week between interview portions.'Phone interview' was done in person - was ninja interview - took 4 days for feedback and next steps took at least a week to planReal interview consisted of 5 interviews plus a lunch that wasn't an interview.One week later I was told to immediately provide contacts from my current employer. 4 days later I was rejected.

In-house screening: very nice offices, very nice interviewer. Asked a question, then asked to optimize the solution. I was able to ask questions about Facebook culture and work.They gave a tour in the office which looks very good.

Contact me via email firstly, then follow the process HR provides. The whole process is well guided and clear. The interviews are not tricky and the people are very nice.1.HR call about background2.Phone interview about projects3.Onsite technical interview

Recruiter called me and asked a couple of HR questions. Schedule a phone interviewed. First phone interview is not hard at all; I implemented with Java but obviously it's not what interviewer thought. Then along with second phone interview. two questions, I did them quick.2 days later I was asked to join the on-site interview. I am a little bit nervous in my on-site. Basically the questions were not hard…  at all. But I was too nervous(It was my first on-site interview in US) and wasn't able to figure out the best solution before timeout.

Was submitted as an employee referral, so this may have been quicker than some other folks' experience; first talk with a recruiter to offer was about 10 days. The recruiting team was very on the ball, also.Had one talk with a recruiter about my background, a technical phone screen (as with many companies, writing actual code over a shared-document web page), and a half day on site of in-person interviews.…  Interviews on site were 3 technical sessions (two coding, one design), a deep discussion of my experience and work style with a manager, and a social lunch (which one should assume is also a "fit" interview although no company I've visited called it that.)Interviewers were down to earth rather than with the attitude I'd expect of some of the large "hot" companies; the two coding problems involved fairly standard (if potentially fiddly) string or graph manipulations -- one required recursion (or a fairly complicated stack structure) while the other was easier iteratively, and I was asked to re-implement it using recursion in remaining time. As with pretty well everywhere, expect to also give a big-O estimate of the run time, and find some failure cases (or at least explain where you're already handling it.)The design interview question was tailored to some specialized work I've done and the particular is probably not representative of most groups; as I understand it, everyone gets some level of design interview and it's usually roughly some form of "how would you build this part of an app like ours for our scale."Got my offer a few days after interviewing. Overall, a very positive experience.

Recruiter contacted me.First telephonic interview was 45 mins and a single coding question.All interviewers were good except one of the interviewer who asked about system design question (he was rude and wanted to show off).1) Behavior - prepare for difficult bug etc. questions. What u want to do at Facebook.2) Lunch3) System design - give more importance to these type of questions. Asked me about design a system to run…  a command on all the servers (say 1 million) within the same network from one of the server on the network.4) Coding - Given a NxN matrix with values X and O where X represent land and O represent water find the number of islands. Two consecutive X X (horizontal or vertical) will be part of single island while diagonal X X are not. (Solve using graph - DFS or BFS)5) Coding - from list of strings, generate list of list of strings which are anagrams of each other.I did really well, but I guess not good compared to other candidates.Overall interview was easy if you have prepared for Algos and Data Structures. Please give more attention to1) Writing perfect code on white board.2) System design questions

The hiring process is made up of phone screens plus a single on-site interviews day. The phone screens are mostly technical in nature and involve coding on a shared editor platform, like collabedit.com. The coding needs to be pretty clean, concise and correct. You are asked to detect and fix bugs in your code.

They contacted me for the position.HR discussion was goodTechnical interview was not a great experience. The interviewer had no understanding of the industry I was coming from so there was huge gap.Questions1. Print the following in html   15 9   2 610   37   482. Linked list vs array list3. hash map4. project explanation.

I applied through LinkedIn and got a call by HR within a couple of days. Was called for 1st round of onsite interview. It didn't go great but I qualified for the 2nd round which consisted of four interview...two rounds of pure coding, one round of system design, and one round of behavioral plus small coding interview. I didn't do very well in one or more of these and didn't…  get the offer.

I had a very bad interview experience with Facebook Seattle recently. Two days after the interview, they called me and asked for references and told me they would provide the feedback in the next day. Not happening but after 5 days, they told me I did not have an offer but I can apply again in 3 months because there are some bugs in my codes and also in the…  design question interview, although I answered all the questions right but I did not push through it.

Facebook recruiters approached me at a conference. Interview followed shortly thereafter; all interviewers had looked at my resume and were ready to ask me questions about my grad work, something that I didn't see in a lot of places. They even put me on the phone with their VP of data infrastructure, which was something that I wouldn't really expect from a company their size. Overall, a great process.

I entered the process via a recruiter I'd worked with previously.I started out with a phone screen that went well -- some simple puzzle questions that were easy to work out on the fly.From there I moved on to the on-site interview. This was a series of 4-5 one-on-one interviews with engineers who posed various technical problems -- whiteboard coding, design problems. I found the questions moderately challenging, but none…  were killers. I'm pretty sure there was a "culture fit" session in there somewhere, too.I didn't like what I sensed of the interviewers' attitudes -- most of them seemed more interested in showing how smart he was than in hearing from me. It hinted at a lack of confidence, and a work atmosphere with some unhealthy internal politics and competition.

I received a phone call a few days after applying for a position online. After a brief screening of my skills, the recruiter set up a phase-1 interview with a single Engineer. She gave me the option of doing it over the phone or at the Facebook headquarters. I chose the latter because I live nearby. I was scheduled for a 45 minute interview. The engineer was very friendly and…  inquisitive about my past projects. This is the easy part, talking about myself. He didn't have a copy of my resume, which I thought was lame. Anyway, after discussing my more recent projects, we moved on to the whiteboard coding part of the interview. This part was a pleasant surprise. It was done in a collaborative way, where I would discuss my solution, psudo-code, then code, and receive suggestions or other form of input from the engineer. The last 15 minutes were spent discussing the culture at Facebook and specifics about the team I was interviewing for. It took them more than a week to get back to me, which I would like to think was because they wanted to complete interviews for the other candidates.

This was probably one of the longest interview processes I had to go through. The recruiter was wonderful. She was always very professional and responsive. First I had a phone interview with the hiring manager. It was a very straight forward conversation and he asked me to give him some pseudo code on how to square a number using their online tool. Standard algorithm questions which I answered correctly. Afterward,…  the recruiter said it went well and that she would be in contact with me about what the next steps are. A week goes by and she calls me back telling me I have to write an Adobe Air or Java application using the Facebook API's.I thought it was a little bit much for them to ask me to spend my time writing something I would not be getting paid for. I really wanted to get the job and impress the hiring manager though so I spent my free time, over a two week period making something that looked great and worked really well. It then took them two months to review the application. To me this was totally unprofessional and kind of a slap in the face. The recruiter was in contact with me the whole time and told me they were all busy with their big change to the privacy features.Finally the hiring manager looked at the application but the recruiter told me they wanted someone else internal to look at the code as well. She told me they were impressed with the application and had rejected a lot of other candidates applications right away. I sat in limbo another few weeks while another person looked at the application. The recruiter then calls me back to tell me that the position I was applying for was dropped. Not that they hired someone else, but that they changed the role I was applying for completely. I think the software engineering interview process has hit an all time low.First they make the engineer jump through hoops of logic games. Then spout out algorithms and uses of design patterns like robots. Finally you have to spend your free time writing something that they are only going to throw in the garbage. We have all really fallen to a sad state.

I got two stages of the interview, first a skype call with coding in shared environment (where I did good enough) and second - an on-site interview in London office.It was made of four talks with technical guys, all very positive and friendly. I failed to be as good as I was expected to be, so I haven't been given an offer.The tasks I had to solve seemed easy on…  first sight, but actually allowed different ways of solving them.Also I failed to convince interviewers in the impact I have done in design of my previous projects.

A recruiter contacted me via LinkedIn. She sent me lots of information and I attended a webinar about interviewing at Facebook. I also got the contact info of an engineer to answer any other questions I have. After the phone interview I was invited for the on site interview. I received the schedule and names of interviewers ahead of time, but they changed at the day of the interview. I…  had lunch with an engineer, his feedback is not part of the interview process.

I was contacted by the recruiter through LinkedIn. After an initial call from HR, I had an technical Skype interview. It took 45 minutes. 30 min. of coding plus 15 min. for experience related stuff and my questions. I wasn't satisfied with my performance, but surpassingly I passed. We were about to schedule a day long on-side interview process. In the meantime, however, I got another offer and I resign,…  as this and preparation would have taken too much time.

I was interviewed by engineer from Facebook with Skype. He asked about my last 2 years experience and something i'm proud of. In the end there was a coding test. I have 15-20 minutes to write code and he asked me to run it by myself. Other questions was about complexity and possible improvements

A recruiter called me and set up a online coding test. One of the super geeks called me from Facebook London office and asked me to create a function in any programming language. The key part is the coding environment is plain text editor and no syntax highlighting. You have to perform and execute your code in your brain.

Short talk with a recruiter, followed by a phone interview. Phone interview involved talking about my previous projects, why facebook, was there anything that concerned me about the role, etc. It then involved a coding question which i've detailed below:

Telephonic interview and then hiring event on Hyd.

Phone screens, one day of onsite interviews, and offer within 2 weeks.

Very nice people. Scheduling the interview and actual interview was straight forward.Unlike some of the other commenters, I didn't find them to be arrogant or frustrating to talk too.

Initially asked about computer science concepts on Data Structures, algorithms. Afther half hour of talk, then i was asked to code some algorithm.

Three phone screens, 1st with Recruiter, second with an engineer, third with an engineer.The engineers were great to talk to, very cooperative and collaborative. The questions they asked were typical text book puzzle programming tricks. The first engineer was not interested in exploring finding a correct answer to the problem, but instead had a particular best-performance trick in mind and wasn't really satisfied that the trick could not be discovered…  easily. The second engineer was far more collaborative and also seemed to be driving towards a best-performance answer, but he entertained possible solution ideas and was very collaborative in guiding towards the solution he was looking for.The first engineer was very animated and excited about his roles and positions at facebook, while the second was a bit more reserved but opened up when asked what he liked about the company and what he thought could be better. Both engineers were working on exciting highly scalable challenging products that would likely be a dream job for many software engineers, including myself.I loved the collaborative editing suite facebook uses to do the coding questions online and found it very helpful in sharing notes and coding solutions. Similar suites for other companies have low character limits and/or wonky execution.I received a prompt response after the second interview that Facebook will not be proceeding further, though I thought both interviews went well (aside from not knowing the the programming trick the interviewer had in mind).The recruiter or hiring manager also flagged my profile in facebook somehow so I receive a not-so-warm greeting at the top of every other job page I view on facebook saying "Facebook will not consider you further" more or less, which is a bit rude in my opinion. If an engineer does not fit for one group in the company that does not mean they will not fit at all.Like others, I received no feedback from the recruiter on why I was passed over, which is unfortunate because the more I learned about the company through interviewing, the more interested I became in giving Facebook a shot as a part of my career.

I had a phone interview with a Facebook recruiter. That lead to a phone screen with an engineer and code tests using a shared text editor. I was then invited on-site for an all day marathon of four 45 minute whiteboard interviews.The on-site was odd. Of the 4, 2 interviews were decent and work related: high level discussions of design. The other 2 were standard Valley algorithm tests. I really…  don't see the point of these things. They have no relation to actual work and are completely arbitrary.

**************************************Operations Associate User Intelligence**************************************
Phone interview first, basic standard questions with some twists. Brought me in for a 3 hour interview process with 4-5 people. Office is awesome

**************************************Business Analyst**************************************
Recruiter reached out to talk about a position I applied for, but he never confirmed back the time to talk about it. Very unprofessional. I mean if you really are not interested don't email me in the first place. Don't give people hope then crush it. So rude.

I got an email to schedule a brief call. The recruiter was approachable and nice. She told me they had already hired someone but wanted to followup to see what type of person I was to see if they could reach out to me again in the future for career opportunities. I appreciated though I haven't heard back since. Happy for the opportunity to speak to Facebook.

recruiter interviewed me. horrible experience.

The first interview was the basic HR background information, talk about your resume, etc. The main purpose is to screen you and make sure that you are a "fit" with the entrepreneurial and results focused company. The HR rep was very nice and responsive and made me feel comfortable. I was able to get to the second stage of the phone interview with the hiring manager. He was not as…  easy to read and it was a pretty difficult interview. They wanted somebody with more programming skills then I had. The questions were the toughest part.

Standard resume screen, behavioral interview.

Uploaded resume and cover letter on careers websiteWas contacted by recruiter.During the phone interview the recruiter only asked me for my cv, and my experience with Tableau. The job position itself was much more complex (did not have a strong focus on Tableau, although it was mentioned) and I did not deviate strongly from my actual CV/resume that I handed in. Then the recruiter pointed out that she thinks that…  I do not have enough seniority for the position (which I am wondering about - I was clear on my CV about my qualifications and didnt deviate from that in my self-introduction). So I wonder what her change-of-mind comes from. Then she pointed out that she had another position in mind that would be better suited for me. I also wrote her a follow-up mail, but have not heard from her since. Overall this is really disappointing.

Great experience in the interview Process. Interviewer asked smart questions, very friendly and conducive. Great company to work for! Nice office and employees are given a lot of space to be innovative and creative. Smart casual setting.

Amazing process.I was sourced through LinkedIn and a recruiter reached out to me. Had a quick general profile discussion and I was forwarded for a telephonic screening with the business. In screening round, I was asked about my experience, hobbies, interests, passion, digital industry, advertisement space etc. The interviewer was really warm and pleasant to talk to. I was then contacted within a couple of days by the recruiter for…  an onsite interview. This was a set of four interviewers - my business manager, her peer manager in cross functional team, my technical manager and one of my peers for technical evaluation. The interview itself tells you, people are not bossy! It is important that your potential team together sees you befitting the role. A lot of behavioral questions, literally out of the box thinking was tested. I was not tested on what have I done in the past and a trust was invested in me. I was rather asked things that I do not know and how FB can help me know those and once I know them, how can they help me function better. What do I want in life, what motivates me, my short term goals, my long term goals, my choices, my aptitude - overall, I could feel the focus on just ensuring one goal, "We need to know the person we are hiring, and not just the programmer we are hiring"Cut short -I have given interviews at multiple places including some of the best organizations in the world, bigger than this one too, but never felt this comfortable and yet challenged!

They want to be big as Google, but the interviewing proccess is disrespectful.If the candidates are not the chosen ones, why not letting them know? At least Google gave me an answer, Amateurs.

**************************************Safety Analyst**************************************
Spoke with recruiter, had a follow up interview with the manager. The recruiter was really friendly, encouraging, nice. The manager asked all questions about my personality/behavior. He wasn't very friendly and was very strict on time.

**************************************Global Marketing Manager**************************************
8 phases: 1 phone screen with HR, with Background check, plus 3 phone interviews with senior management from different roles and countries, 4 face to face interviews in the office to check culture fit. Regular questions used by this type of company. It was not too long.

**************************************Front End Engineer, Infrastructure**************************************
The position I interviewed for was a 10 month contract through a staffing agency. In order to get an in-person interview I answered a 4 question written test that was emailed to me. In my opinion, the questions were not very well thought out and did not reflect well on the hiring process I was about to enter. At least one of the questions was actually relevant to the position…  for which I was interviewing. Though it was rather trivial.The in-person interview was three 45 minute sessions, each of which consisted entirely of solving a programming problem on the whiteboard. The questions were not relevant to the task I would be performing if hired. They were just generic algorithms off of somebody's Comp Sci 101 test.Unfortunately I suck at the "solve an irrelevant problem in a prison cell interrogation environment" so I did not get a call back. Fortunately this weakness hasn't prevented me from having an extremely successful career. Just not at any of the companies that utilize this lazy man's approach to interviewing.

**************************************Software Engineer - New Grad**************************************
I applied through my school's career services and was contacted by a recruiter a few weeks later. She set up a phone interview that she did herself. It was a technical interview, asking questions about data structures, algorithms, and runtime analysis. It wasn't hard. The questions were mostly about trees, hash tables, and a couple sort algorithms. She was nice at first when she asked me about my experience in…  the field (school projects and internship experiences) but she caught me off guard when asking the technical questions and I asked for a minute to think about the answer. Even though she said yes, a moment later she'd say "Would you like me to move on to the next question?" as if I didn't know the answer, but I did. So I'd try to explain to her what I thought at that moment and if I missed anything in my explanation, even the smallest thing, she'd cut me off to point that out and moved on to the next question. Fortunately, I did quite well. By the end of the week she emailed me that I'm through to the next round and that another recruiter would contact me with the details.After a few weeks, I didn't hear back from them so I emailed her. Apparently she had been snatched up from Facebook to a new startup company and left her files to other recruiters who didn't have time to go through all. It took me about a month (through the help of friends who also interviewed with Facebook and school's career services) to finally get ahold of a Facebook recruiter. She apologized and set me up with another interview right away. A software engineer called me a few days later and we used a website that let me code and he'd be able to see it. The second interview was just one coding problem (make sure you're fast and code bug-free programs!) and then we spent about 15-20 minutes talking about Facebook itself. I thought I did well and hit it off with the interviewer. But a few days later I got an email saying that I'm not through.

**************************************Software Developer**************************************
I applied online and through my university's career fair. I got an on campus interview of two coding questions, followed by an on site interview of about 4 technical interviews and 1 behavioral. Then the offer.

Software developer internship interview is done in 2 rounds. One is initial screening by any software engineer from the company and the other one is on-site. Got a call from recruiter and was asked to give dates for an interview.Both were phone interviews.

Campus Recruiting where candidates were selected on Resume Shortlisting during Career fair.The Career fair took place in Sept and one month later they got back. The recruiter was good but was not happy with my solutions in n logn complexity. He wanted both the questions in o(n)

Overall, the process was straight-forward, but a bit slow in turnaround. I had been contacted by one of the recruiters every 2-3 months for the past year or so, and just had to give the go-ahead. Every round of scheduling seemed to take a week, and then getting feedback was another 3-4 days minimum, then another week until the next interview.

Phone screen (with coding). Sometimes had difficulty understanding the guy. No behavioral, pure code. Question itself was pretty challenging compared to the other questions I've gotten at other places, but not unsolvable. I didn't get a working solution, unfortunately, before I ran out of time.

there was a phone interview starting with introduce yourself, asked me about the current on-campus part-time job, describe your typical day. Then he gave me the coding question of finding a triplet which sums to 6, given an array of integers.

I applied online, and then was scheduled a phone screen interview through email. I got a call after two weeks. First part was a five mins mutual self-introduce, then jumped to the technical questions using collabedit online. The interviewer was very nice and gave necessary guide during the whole interview process.

Contacted by a recruiter. 45 minute phone technical interview. The interviewer was very nice and asked about my interest in working at facebook. Contacted by a recruiter. 45 minute phone technical interview. The interviewer was very nice and asked about my interest in working at facebook.

Current employees take turn talking with you. Interviews includes everyone from peer developers, to the architects and product managers. Some interviews were frank discussions while others included white boarding abstract system design.

One technical interview conducted on campus. Very quick response time and nice people. I would learn one language and be a master at it before going for the interview. Have very good reasons for why facebook specifically

I applied online and within a few days received a request to choose a date for a 45min technical interview. They sent me a link of the "collabedit" I think - to familiarize myself with it.Once I got on the phone with the interviewer, she send me the link and she had already typed the problem that I had to solve. The problem statement was unclear, when I asked questions…  she could not explain well what she wanted, there was a lot of disturbance on the phone - so I offered to start writing some code but she would not let me write till I came up with some idea of how I would proceed with the data structure she had in mind.Unfortunately, we spent 40 minutes just talking and brainstorming and then finally in the last 5 minutes she said I could start coding. I quickly wrote some working code, but ofcourse 5 minutes is just not enough.Overall, I think they should have a timed online code assessment where these all issues don't come in the way.

First round, a 45 minutes phone interview. At the first 15 minutes, the interviewer gave me a brief introduction of his group, and asked me to introduce myself and my experience. In the second part, which is a 30 minutes, he asked me some coding problems.

Applied online, was contacted by a recruiter. Had one phone screen then was asked to come in for a full loop at the Seattle campus.The culture is unusual for a tech company. It is both good and not so great. The interview was amateur grade. All of the people who interviewed me, except one, had significantly less experience than I did. It's not an ego issue. In most cases, they…  had a little more than 1 year of experience. The problem with someone like that interviewing you is that they might not know of a good way to do it. For example, I was constantly interrupted. I let them know that I was thinking out loud and that everything I say might not be the best way to do something. When I have something concrete I'll set it forward and we can discuss that. That didn't stop the interruptions. I'd lose my train of thought and would have to start again. Again, while writing code, the same thing. I said that the code isn't optimized, i'll optimize it later. I'm trying to get it right, then tweak it later. Every few lines, I was asked if something was necessary.I was pretty frustrated by the end. I wish I could tell them that you're interviewing me- meaning you want to see how I think, check my problem solving ability and NOT show how much you know. You're probably good at what you do, else you wouldn't have been there. Can we please focus on me solving the problem?In other interviews, at other companies, I've noticed the more experience a person has the more patient and observant they are during an interview. They will ask questions and prod, but almost never interrupt unless you're heading down a seriously questionable line of thinking path.

Phone interview, then an interview at the headquarters

Online Coding test + 2 interview 1 hr each

I was contacted by a recruiter via telephone. The phone conversation was simple enough to warrant a trip to the office. The office was nice- catered food, and unlimited soda and candies. The first round interview lasts about 1 hour and consists of questions (no surprise) asking about time complexities calculation and data structures. Make sure you at LEAST know tree traversals before you go into the interview. Given the…  short time limit, feel free to ask your interviewer for help to speed up your answering.

I sent my resume some time ago, then was contacted by a recruiter. We went over my experience and interests. Then I got a technical phone interview, followed by on-site interviews (with a manager + 2 coding interviews + 1 design interview). Got another phone coding interview afterwards. Then received an offer.All the people I spoke with and/or met were very friendly and the overall experience was very positive. The…  campus is nothing short of amazing.

A series of phone interviews, final round is on main campus.

Got a plain email from a UK recruiter to set up a date for a phone interview. Had that interview asking the same questions she asked on the email before and thats it.

They were very professional, they sent me a lot of emails on how to prepare to your interview for Facebook.They made there an internet live sessions with current developers where you can ask questions about the process and about questions they may ask you in the interview.First they make a phone interview where they ask a code question and you have about 40 minutes to answer.There was only one thing…  I was unhappy about, in the live session before the phone interview they said there that the most important thing is to solve the problem they asked you, and only then try to improve your code, well in my interview I solved the problem in only 30 minutes but wouldn't able to improve code efficiency in the last 10 minutes, and a day later they sent me an email saying that it wasn't good enough.well.. what can you do.. it's Facebook.

First I was aked some soft questions like why I am interested in Facebook, etc. After that were two technical questions and finishing with my questions for the interviewer.This one is the first of two techincal interviews needed for the position, I am having the second interview in mid-December.

Several engineers came to recruit to my university. I didn't feel the process was aimed at finding out about my thought process. I felt the interview was more about whether I got the answer and how quickly I figured it out. I did figure it out. The interviewer was at several times messaging on his/her mobile phone while I was explaining my reasoning. I felt he/she was rude at time,…  too. Some friends that interviewed with other recruiters got easier questions and passed to the second interviews. I searched for the question later online and my solution was correct and optimal. Bad taste on the whole experience.

So far have had 3 interviews and am going onsite for further interviews (I am an international candidate). First was a "general chat" lasting about an hour, including some basic technical questions about the Objective-C runtime. Second and third interviews were technical/coding challenges - an easier question and harder question. Coding is done in a shared online code editor. At every stage the recruitment contact has been *very* helpful, and…  the technical interviewers were also great to get along with.

This was an interview where Facebook came to our University to hire students. First we talked a little about what I do, the interviewer does. He asked me about my Interests in Facebook, about why I'd want to work there. After that came the coding - he explained it not so strait forward..

Was contacted by an internal recruiter (not through an agency). Basic phone screener to initially determine my eligibility. This was followed by a second technical phone interview with an engineer at Facebook. Collabedit was used to allow me to type and the interviewer to review what I was typing. The questions asked of me can be found on glassdoor - do your research!I made it to an in person interview…  where I met first with a technical engineer. More coding, this time on a whiteboard which is really annoying. Made it past that, then met with a manager for lunch to discuss the position a bit further. He asked me typical team, role, and fit related questions. In the end, I was offered the position, but turned it down.

It was a phone screen, first the interviewer asked me a couple of questions about my background. Then he asked me to solve two technical problem. Finally he let me ask questions about Facebook.

A recruiter has contacted me through linked-in, asked whether I'll be interested to work for them, then had a talk about why would I like to work for them and I replied: that I would like to work with the best engineers.Afterward I had a phone interview with some engineer, asked me to write binary search, when I finished, he asked me to write binary search on a shifted array…  (10 20 1 2 3 4). Wrote that and then asked me to find the offset (2) in log n. I guess I did that ok and then I was invited to onsite interview.I had 4 consecutive interviews: first one was a general talk about my experience, second was to write a json beautifer, third was to design their newsfeed, and last was to write a program that prints all subsets of size k of a given set with n integers.

Basically focusing on data structure and algorithms. 5 rounds of different interviewers. Use white board and pen to answer coding questions. And also questions about pay expectations.

**************************************Partnerships**************************************
I was contacted by an employee who referred me. After I was contacted by an internal recruiter who arranged for 3 rounds of interviews with about 15 people. Questions were very relevant to the job. Interviews were pleasant and interviewers were smart in contrast with other companies were I interviewed. The process lasted 2 months.

I saw the role advertised on facebook.com/careers and it looked made for me: my level of experience, exact sector specialisms and working in a team that I had had regular contact with in a previous role.I first contacted a few people within Facebook (either my own contacts or through colleagues) to understand more about the role, working at Facebook and the recruitment process. A huge positive for the company is…  that everyone you speak to at Facebook is amazingly enthusiastic about working there and very keen to pass that enthusiasm on to you.I submitted a customised, comprehensive CV and cover letter to my main contact at Facebook who said she would pass it on to the HR lead working on this role.Two weeks go by and, fortunately for me, I spent a bit of time prepping for a possible interview (thanks Glassdoor for some great interview question suggestions!)After two weeks, I send my contact a chasing email and at 4.30pm that afternoon, a recruitment manager from Facebook emailed to request a half hour phone interview at 6.30 that evening - lucky I'd done some prep already.On the phone interview, the lady was initially unsure which role I was interviewing for and had not got my CV or cover letter. She told me that the hiring manager was in London in two days time so we had to move quickly. Oh, and the job description online has now changed - they require someone with different sector specialism and technical product experience. We spent 30 mins talking through my CV, why I wanted to work for Facebook and what I thought I could bring to the role, but it was clear that the goal posts had moved and I was no longer suitable for the role... Surprise surprise, no call back.Overall a disappointing experience with a disorganised and unclear process.

I applied online on facebook careers. Got mail from technical recruiter for phone in interview. 1st round was a Phone in interview which lasted for 45 minutes.The interviewer was a nice guy and was very cool. He helped me in each stage to proceed when i got stuck.

The whole telephone lasts about 40 minutes, a Facebook technology person begins the interview by introducing herself and the project she is doing now. Then she asked some background questions. And we talk something about my experience both on education and career. And then she asks me some algorithm questions.When i was stuck by the question, she was friendly and gave me some hint to help me finish that question.

Very straightforward no tricky questions. Just wanted to see that I had done my homework. I had an interview on campus and then three more at Facebook, and the process was over quickly. They got back to me within a couple of days.

**************************************Public Content**************************************
Interview lasted about 40minutes and consisted of a 1:1 in a small room in these big chairs. Very informal setting but make sure your posture is correct in those chairs as it can be a bit awkward which you may come off awkward as well. Pretty straight forward interview. At the end you will be asked to do a little written test thats timed. They ask pretty much how you…  would go about communicating to a facebook member about a problem. You have 5minutes.

First was an initial phone screaming which you will get past if you are able to talk on the phone with another human being. Next is an in person interview which is pretty straight forward. After that is another in person interview which at that point they will offer you the position. The process is more relaxed then stressful and if you have what they are looking for then it…  shouldn't be difficult to get hired.

**************************************Security Manager**************************************
Après un premier entretien téléphonique avec un recruteur, un deuxième a été organisé avec un des responsables de la branche. Le premier est généraliste, le deuxième fut plus technique. Ces entretiens ont à chaque fois duré un peu plus d'une demi-heure.

**************************************Client Solutions Manager**************************************
First interview was via phone with a Recruiter in NY. This was a positive experience, she was very nice and knowledgable about the role and process. The in person interview is where it got very odd. I interviewed in person in the Chicago office. I was placed in a tiny, hot room with no windows where I met with 4 different people, 2 via video conference.Each person drilled me with…  all soft skills questions and no one really asked me about myself, my experience or anything. Each session with each person had a different "theme" around what questions they were asking me and they all just read off a sheet of paper. No one was very personable at all and no one told me why they like working at Facebook.The last person that came in gave me a scenario to prep for about 15 minutes and then present to her how I would up-sell the client. She gave me no feedback on what she would do differently or what she would change.I walked out of the interview feeling very uneasy about the opportunity and the company and didn't have any additional knowledge about the role itself.

First interview was over the phone with a CMS from New York. A few day later I was invited to headquarters for an in person interview with two employees. Seemed to go well. It was very laid back and casual. A few days later I had another phone interview consisting of two 30 min sessions with two higher ups. They dug further into my resume and asked more in depth…  questions.

The process is extremely professional. From the time the recruiter contacted me until the time an offer was presented it was a very smooth well communicated process. recruiter was very helpful in negotiations and was willing to fight for my interests. Also if you don't get the job the first time and you felt you had a nice repport with the team, keep in contact. It's easier for a company…  to bring in a pending candidate again that might be a better fit in a different roll than to start over again.

I had a series of four interviews. I was a contractor at Facebook applying for an internal role so the process is likely a little different than an external candidate.

The interview process took 2.5+ months, the recruiter(s) and people I met with were incredibly nice and supportive throughout the entire process - hands down the best recruiting processes I've experienced. The process can be a little long but still a fantastic overall. I would recommend checking out FB Blueprint to get more knowledgeable about FB's Ad Solutions when interviewing for this role or any ad-related role.1. After applying I…  was contacted by a recruiter and an initial phone interview was set up2. 30 min phone interview with recruiter, asking mostly behavioral questions while assessing fit for the role3. After the interview the recruiter checked in with the hiring manager to confirm whether I could be a good fit4. I was called in to the office to have four (4) 30 min interviews back to back with several individuals from FB, including my hiring manager. It was a great way to meet different people in the organization. Each interviewer is tasked with asking different questions and gauging different skills but everyone is looking for fit. Questions ranged from behavioral, to situational but also problem solving questions with regards to measurement.5. A 1.5 weeks after I was offered the job and they proceeded with reference checks, contract signing and onboarding.

Applied through employee referral. 1-week process. Did a phone interview. The talk was very light, I didn't feel like I was interviewed. The recruiter was nice and explained further about the job requirements.The job requires relocation and I had to decline unfortunately.

First call was to present the job and to know more about my background. Second call was deeper talking about the job and more technical questions. I was then invited into their offices to meet 3 different people. I wasn't accepted because of a lack of experience in a specific market. It was a great experience!

I applied online. Got contacted from México.First it was a phone screen. Then they sent me a confidential agreement. Then interviews started:1st: basic questions. Then specific about online advertising. Then, brainteasers. Passed.The interviewer here was great! Nice person, made you feel good.2nd: personal questions, specific questions about ads online and startegy. Finance questions. Untill here was where i got.The interviewer was a bit obnoxious.Overall the experience was good. Want to…  give it another shot.

Recruiter contacted me immediately after I submitted my resume. It took 2 weeks to get the phone call from Recruiter (as there are holidays etc. and the recruiter seems to be pretty busy). Recruiter was nice enough to refer me to this job post ( I was originally applying for Marketing Science Analyst) and one week after I got a chance for on-site interview, 2 rounds with department head and…  team head separately.Interviewers are easy-going and chatty. It lasted for nearly 2 hours - I certainly enjoyed it. However I still haven't got my interview feedback yet after nearly 2 week. I guess it was a No and they are too busy to inform me. Sad :(

I was contacted by the recruiter via my linkedin account on Monday, and had a phone screening by Thursday.I was noticed on the next day for the next process, about 2 weeks later I had a phone screening with the member who is on the same role for 30 minutes.Next day, had been noticed for the on-site interview with 4 members, 30 minutes each which was held a week later.Next…  day, had been noticed for the on-site interview with 3 members, 30 minutes each which was held a week later.Next day I went to the next process, which was reference check.Week later, received an offer.

Interview process was smooth but took quite long -around 2 months-. Interviewed with 7 individuals from various levels.General digital media knowledge, analytical skills and past experience relevancy questioned and tested.Presentation stage was challenging but fun. Experience in a related industry is a strong plus.It is good idea to outline what is CSM's responsibilities and why you are a perfect fit.

I did assessment test and then had another face-to-face interview. the assessment test took around one and half hour. In the 1:1 interview, they asked about resume, knowledge of customer service and your competence in Facebook adverts. need quantitative and communication skills

Interview with recruiter and hiring manager.Love the way they arrange for the interview. Everyone is really friendly and helpful. It was a good interview experience though I wasn t accepted

I was initially contacted via LinkedIn for that position. Afterwards I had an interview with a Facebook recruiter via phone. Thereafter one more telephone interview with Head of Client Management before I was interviewed from three different managers via video call. Overall the atmosphere was nice and the questions not too hard/quite obvious.

The First stage was a phone call with HR. Here I was informed about the role and the next steps of the interview.The Second stage was a video conference call with a personel from Facebook. At this stage my marketing skills and knowledge of the local market were questioned.The Third stage was an invite to Dublin. Here is were I was asked to prepare and execute a presentation.

**************************************Software Engineer for Android**************************************
I had a telephonic interview asking overall 8 multiple choice questions. The questions where real big to keep in mind for telephonic round. So one has to listen very carefully during interview.

**************************************Consultants**************************************
there was not much things to answer they just asked that why i would like to join the company

**************************************Facebook Internship**************************************
I turned in my resume during college job fair, and were given a chance to interview on campus.

**************************************Software Engineer IOS**************************************
I applied for a job and recruiter from Facebook initiated the process of 2 phone screening interview 45 minutes each. I was ask to implement Anagram checker, removing duplicates from array procedure and "permutations for digits represented by phone number" task. The recruiter and FB HR person were nice and supportive. The main request they had after the first interview is speed, as I understand from discussion the speed is…  very import for them in candidates.

**************************************Ads Data Analyst**************************************
It was quite hard to get an interview for facebook. Anyhow i have managed to get an interview through a consulting firm, which happened after a initial screening of my profile. Interview was quite challenging and it went almost for an hour. Full of application oriented questions, which took me to think for a while before answering to the questions. But I got a good feedback from the interviewer.

**************************************Marketing Specialist, Community Operations UK**************************************
1. Phonecall with the Recruiter - Going over my CV, relative experience, testing knowledge of the role. Overall the recruiter was extremely pleasant and helpful during all stages.2. 30min Video call with a member of the CO Team - Thoroughly enjoyed this stage & the interviewer really made me comfortable throughout the process. He had someone shadowing the call as well but both were friendly and I really felt it…  went well.3. Final stage involved three 30min video calls with separate employees - The first was with a Market manager who was really friendly and relaxed, had some tough questions but was very enjoyable to interview with and mainly focused on me & my experiences. The second was difficult with the interviewees being somewhat tougher & asking very specific market questions. I could tell they were looking for in-depth answers. The final video call was more solution based and designed to test your problem solving. It was much more analytical and the questions were tough but the interviewee was again extremely friendly which helped.Unfortunately, I didn't receive an offer & I'm still waiting for feedback but it was an extremely positive experience. I do think all three rounds went well but i'm not quite sure I had the level of detail & knowledge on the market/CO that they required.

**************************************Senior Software Development Engineer**************************************
A 45 minute phone screen, followed by an hour at their offices. This hour was 15-20 minutes touring with the recruiter, and ~40 minutes on a white board question. Interviewer was very disinterested, gave the impression he didn't want to be there. After the white board problem, interviewer dumped me at the elevator and ran off. Other Facebook employees in the elevator with me commented on how rude my interviewer…  was.Recruiter mentioned they expect a 50 hour week.

**************************************User Operations Analyst**************************************
Spoke with a recruiter who then set up a video interview with a member of the community operations team in Austin. Mostly asked about my experience and how I would help people with different user issues. Most of the experience questions were related to problem-solving and steps I took to solve them. I was also asked to explain how to use an existing Facebook feature, some of its benefits, and…  how I would see if it was being adopted by users.

A 30 mins written test, containing 2 essay questions. 400 words minimum

I applied online through Facebook page, and they contacted me right immediately like on that day which was scary for me. I guess they embody truly the culture of moving fast. I got an e-mail with to complete some online test with 13 questions and they were on:13 questions:9 Analytical Multiple Choice Questions – focusing on sets, trend analysis, calculus, stats, etc.1 open ended basic SQL question.1 open ended normalization…  question.1 Multiple Choice English language comprehension question.1 open ended language question (this part should be 200 – 300 words).The entire online assessment test was conducted through hackerrank.com and it was for 90 min.Personally I did not go and complete the Quiz within couple of day. I did take my time to prepare and I was right. It is a difficult test. I did use apps like the impossible interview and the aptitude interview from iTunes app store to prepare. They were a help.

I applied online via Facebook and received an email from a recruiter two or three days later. First interview was via the phone with a recruiter and was pretty relaxed. She asked about some of my experience specific to the position and also had me walk through some resume highlights. She then talked about the position I applied for as well as another she thought might be a good fit…  and asked about my general interests as it related to those positions. Overall, the interview lasted about 30 minutes. She said she'd pass me onto a phone interview with a team member.Phone interview with the team member was a fairly straightforward behavioral interview that lasted about 30 minutes.The original recruiter contacted me and said they wanted to invite me in-person. It sounded like there was some internal reshuffling/reorganization and they ended up cancelling the in-person interview.Overall, my interviewers were fairly friendly and didn't ask any hardball questions. Interviews were fairly relaxed and felt more like conversations.

I had three different phone interviews in addition to the on-site and the online timed writing task. They want to make sure you are a good fit for Facebook. It's also a great opportunity for you to make sure Facebook is a good fit for you. All-in-all, it was a smooth process and my recruiter was awesome. My advice: prep yourself for the interviews (e.g. come up with answers to…  possible questions, scenarios, etc.)!

Referred by a friend. Contacted by a recruiter via email shortly thereafter.

On campus screen and writing sample. General questions, nothing surprising. About two weeks later a recruiter called and offered an onsite. Flew to the interview later that week and had four rounds of interviews with three analysts and a manager.

I was referred in for a position through a friend and put in touch with a recruiter. I did an initial screen with the recruiter and she had me interview with someone on the team the next day. Both were phone interviews, both lasted about 30 minutes and just covered basic background experience and interest. From there, I was invited into the office for an in-person interview - that consisted…  of four interviews with team leads. After that, I did one more phone interview with a director. I interviewed with a total of seven individuals individually (including the recruiter).Everyone I interviewed with was super friendly, incredibly punctual, and the follow up was always timely and informative. The recruiter prepped me well for each round after my initial interview with her and none of the interviewers threw me any super weird curveballs. Overall, one of the more pleasant interviewing experiences I have ever had. The whole process start to finish took a little over 2.5 weeks, but I think I just happened to get in at a time when they had already scheduled and blocked times for interviews so it happened to move really quickly for me.

After submitting my resume on the Facebook website a recruiter e-mailed me and asked me to complete a timed online writing sample. The writing sample consisted of two questions. After submitting the writing sample the recruiter got back in touch with me to complete a phone interview. The phone interview lasted about 20 minutes and consisted primarily of discussion regarding my work experience and a brief description of the position.…  I was asked to come in to the Austin location for an interview. I was given a brief tour of the facility and had four one-to-one interviews. The recruiter called me a week later to tell me that they would not be offering me the position.

Very helpful in making sure I got through the interview process in the amount of time I needed. The final round was very detail oriented, and they are focused on making sure that you are love Facebook and User Operations. Make sure you have experience with all of their user operation tools on the website such as help center, etc.

The only reason the entire process took 3 months was because I was abroad at the time I started communicating with FB about the role. They were prompt throughout the whole process. I received a call about a week after submitting my resume (via an FB recruiter). The process consisted of an initial phone interview, followed by a writing sample test, and 2 more phone interviews. Since I was not…  in the US at the beginning of the process, I did one Skype interview and was flown out to Austin when I got back to have 4 more interviews at the office. My last interview was on a Thursday and I received a call on the following Tuesday. Rather than just saying "sorry can't offer you a position," the recruiter actually explained which questions indicated to the team that there might not be a match.

3 online questions - easyphone interview - easyanother phone interview -easyon site interview - met 4 people in 2 hours - easy to hard....it's fun after all.

Very, very chill. I went in in a suit and my interviewer had on jeans and a tshirt. There were several on campus events before the interview of which I went to one to just mingle. These were very relaxed environments and the recruiters were very willing to talk about all subjects even outside of the job/company details.

Very casual interview. The process was done through my university and it began with a "coffee hour" the day before to meet some of the recruiters and talk a bit more about the company. The interview was very laid-back and asked basic questions about my resume and experiences. Interviewer was very friendly and I was told I didn't need to dress up, which I of course still did.

In the phone interview, they look for people exactly matching this position and have a lot of passion for this position.

I met first with Facebook's recruiter at The University of Texas and was then taken to speak with a current employee of Facebook. He asked detailed questions about my resume and leadership experience and typed into his laptop. There were behavioral questions and open ended questions without definitive answers. The open ended questions can overwhelm if you are not prepared to come up with strategy. While both recruiters were kind…  the interview felt very exclusive. Tip: Wear Business Professional even though they interview in jeans and T-shirts.

There were many steps to their interview process: interview at the university career services, an easy written test, and two on-site interviews. Be prepared for all types of behavioral questions and random ones that just test how you think (ie. if you could be any animal what would you be). In the end, it just wasn't a good fit. I liked half of the people I met, and disliked the…  other half.

I applied online through Facebook's website. I was contacted several weeks later by a recruiter. After an initial conversation with the recruiter, I was required to complete a writing sample online. A few more weeks went by while the sample was being "reviewed." Finally, a phone interview was set up. The questions consisted largely of my experiences working on a team, what I thought I brought to teams, what to…  do if a team member is not participating, etc.All in all, it was an "ok" experience.

I submitted my resume online on the first week of Dec 2010. A few hours later, a recruiter sent me an email response with a link to a writing test. I passed the test because the same recruiter emailed back and requested a phone interview. The recruiter was very nice and asked general questions about my background and why I wanted to work at FB. They scheduled me for an…  on-site interview a few days later but it was moved to the first week of Jan 2011 because some of the staff members were on vacation.On the day of the interview, the recruiter said that I was going to be interviewed by 5 people instead of 4! It wasn't any big deal for me because I had already prepared myself. The first interview was with 2 members who were young and started as analysts. The other 3 interviewers were mid and senior-level members. I didn't do well in one of them because the person asked really difficult questions and I had to pause and think for a minute. That person grilled me and I left the place feeling confused. The members were nice and each one told me in great detail about their job responsibilities. It was interesting hearing from each one of them on how much they enjoyed working there.I got a general rejection email from the FB team a few days later. I felt a bit upset because for 2 weeks, I was researching about the company, website and came up with ideas on how to improve the user interaction. I even prepared my Q&As in two languages (in case they were going to test my language skills). However, I'm glad to have practiced my job interview skills with 5 people.The position is still open. For those who want to apply, I recommend that you study all the basic FB features, the Help Center, Terms of Use, and read a lot of FB news. This entry-level position requires candidates to be above and beyond. Good luck!

Interviewing with Facebook went very smoothly.Three current employees and one manager asked a series of questions focusing on working as a team, challenges that you have overcome in the past, and what kinds of activities put you in the "zone."Facebook interviewers are very open to letting you highlight your strengths, and how that would fit in well with the company's goals.

The process was quick and lasted about 3 weeks. On campus interview, then on site interview at HQ. On site interview started with a tour then sometime to mingle with employees. At the time I didn't realize but the mingling was an informal interview. After lunch, we were placed in a room and 3 different people rotated to interview all of us. Mostly the same questions over and over. It…  was long. Questions sometimes were poorly worded or unclear. Interview processed seemed to be a lot about how you would fit in to the culture in addition to identifying if you have the right skills.

I applied for one of the foreign language analyst positions that were open. After receiving my resume, a recruiter contacted me within 2 days and gave me a link to an online writing test. I had to respond to questions both in English and my foreign language, and translate into my foreign language. I'm not a native speaker of my non-English language, so that's probably why I didn't make it…  any farther. They were very polite, though, and responded quickly, which is amazing if you're on the hunt. After some further investigation (I know people who work for them), it turns out that only people with really top-notch (and I mean absolute number one) language skills were being considered, whereas I was probably middle-ground. I would still really like to work for them someday, what a great company.

I got an email for an 1-hour writing test after I submit my resume online. I passed the written test and had a short phone interview with the recruiter. The recruiter is nice and professional. And I will have another phone interview later today.

Was contacted within days of sending in my application online to do a 3 question timed writing sample. A week or so later I was contacted for a phone interview followed by another 2 question timed writing sample. Had a second interview over a week ago and I am still waiting to hear any news. Questions were fairly simple, interviewers very friendly.

From the time I applied for the position online, it was three weeks before someone e-mailed back asking me to take a 30 minute online timed writing sample comprised of two questions.I thought I would get the chance for an interview at the least because Austin is the first place Facebook is opening U.S. sales and online operations outside of Palo Alto, and they will be hiring at least 200…  people in the next few years. I received an e-mail about a week later saying I'm not the right fit.

Received an email asking for a phone interview and scheduled a time. Phone interview was fairly standard - mostly discussing my resume. Tips: if interviewing for a marketing position, prepare some marketing ideas as well as some comments/thoughts on improvements for the site. Interviewer was polite and friendly, overall the interview went for about 30mins.

The recruiters are excellent here and the company has it's choice of who they want to hire. Names are big at this company so if you didn't graduate from what they call a top tier university... GOOD luck. I had a friend refer me which also helped my case.Just know Facebook and everything it does. Be active on Facebook and go through the HELP CENTER <---

Had 2 phone interviews and several in-person interviews at Facebook HQ over the course of about a month. Interviews were very straightforward -- past experiences, expectations for new position, etc. They were also very informative and fairly honest about the type of work their new hires would be doing.Everyone was very young and seemed pretty willing to give straight answers when I heard about something that didn't seem particularly exciting.…  They definitely describe a lot of the perks in detail, but may not mention the downsides of the work unless you ask.

They seem to have a good work culture, but that's only after you get in. Getting past the screening process is ridiculous and I get the impression that they don't care about anyone external to the company. If you know someone within the company it's a good way to get recognized quicker.

I was interviewed by six people individually on two separate days. Each interviewer took about 30 minutes for the interview. They were either team leads or managers. They described which teams they were from and then went through my resume and started asking specific questions about my work experience.

I applied online. The process included three interview rounds in total. It started out with online tests, which were ok. It is a benefit to prepare. Moving forward I had a two phone interviews and one interview through a video conference. The first interview was with on of the employees from HR and the questions were mostly related to competancy and my motivation for why I wanted the role and…  why I wanted to work for Facebook. The second interview was with someone from the user operations department. I mostly got case questions about what I would do in various situations related to the role. The last interview was with three different people, all from the user operation department, but at different levels.

Applied online. Received an invitation to do an online test a few days after application. The test consisted of 8 analytical multiple choice questions (sets, trend analysis, statistics, calculus), 1 multiple choice comprehension question (questions based on a given short text) and 1 essay question to be answered in the language applied for.

I applied online and then around 2 weeks or so I received an email inviting me to a test. I passed it and went on with a phone interview with the recruiter. She walked me through basic questions like tell me about yourself, what is the trend that you see, how to deal with a thousand of reports per day, how to spot a fake account...After that I got on…  an interview with someone from the team. The conversation got disconnected a few times and then after waiting for more than a week for the result, I got a thank you email. It was disheartening experience

Telephone interview, 4 Skype/site interview

I was referred by a friend and a recruiter called me within a week, we had a long phone call where I spoke a lot about my previous experience and tried to explain how it relates to the position in Facebook ( as I worked in a completely different industry). I was then invited for onsite interviews very quickly. I had 4 onsite interviews, 3 with Team Leads and one…  with the Manager at the time. Interviews were tough but really good, each interviewer touched upon different topic (experience, competency, Facebook products, knowledge of the region I'd be covering etc.). It was a great experience for me, I would've said the same even if I didn't get the job.

First I have taken a skill. Then I have been contacted with a human resources manager, user operations manager and then 4 consecutive skype calls.

I got contacted shortly after submitting my resume,My only negative experience was that there were no news for next result, so I had to follow-up after weeks of waiting.Didn't pass the screening process, but the recruiter was very friendly.

The Recruiter found me on LinkedIn account and attached me a JD. Then HR rang me to ensure that I understand the job description, what did I do and what am I doing now. Furthermore, she set up an analytical interview with another person a week later and passed me to the final interview. All interviews are phone interviews except the last one through skype as I am based in…  England.

Took a questionnaire and then a phone interview.

I applied through an employee referral, and three days later got an e-mail from HR. The 1st screening was 2 different exams One for language and another one for math/statistics skills and sql, both examinations had a time limit and I found them quite interesting and difficult.After that I had to confirm availability for a phone screening with HR and then another one with the Hiring Manager. Questions where basic…  and needed a lot of knowledge on the area and challenges that the company face at the current moment.I was again ask to confirm availability for back-to-back interviews with 4 different people, including the hiring manager. I got an email from two different HR contacts with a bit of information on what each interview would focus on.People where very kind and made me feel on a conversation instead of an interview, but they had a lot of controversial questions, and got a good-cop bad-cop situation going on because the first interview was really difficult and the second not so much, the next one was really hard and the last was easy as could be.They asked me a lot about why facebook, what I wanted from the company, what I liked about my job, where I failed and what I'd do better.I had to show a lot of passion for user operations.

After the first phone interview with HR, I got invited for onsite interviews with 4 different employees. There was the manager of the team, 2 seniors from different teams as well as a senior team member. Really nice people and nice chats, they make you feel very welcome and comfortable. The questions were not mean, just very open and apparently, I should have brought more examples from previous work/life situations…  in order to prove my points.

Hard interviews. Know all of Facebook's features, current and upcoming, and history. They say they are looking for people who truly want to change the world, so be passionate about this and the ways Facebook changes lives. Three phone interviews lead to one on site interview. First two phone interviews went great. Third one, the interviewer was in a rush and did not ask many questions (I tried to be…  considerate of her rushed tone, but this likely hurt me in the end). They would not give feedback, but I feel this I did not get to do the on site because of this.

The agency gave me a call, and interviewed me, I went there once to prep up my CV and once to prepare for the face to face interview. The whole process was quite quick and easy.

I applied to Facebook and as part of the application I had to answer a potential user problem regarding a friend purchasing credits through a game application on Facebook. Afterwards, I made it to the second round and was invited to get to know the people who work at facebook socially at a bar/restaurant cocktail hour.The next morning the formal interview took place.I did make it to the next round…  of interviews.

3 phone interviews including the first one with the recruiter. Then, 3 interviews in Dublin. Facebook invited me to Dublin paying my flight and hotel expenses. Overall, a positive experience.

After having applied for the user operations analyst in Dublin, I have been contacted by the recruitment manager of the Facebook office in Dublin. The tone of her e-mail was very polite and friendly. I was requested some background information such as my past and current employer and salary indication. Also, I was given detailed instructions for a writing test for the second language required for this position. The test…  lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes and consisted of four questions: the first I had to respond in English and the second two in my second language.After I completed the test, I have received an email from the recruitment manager that they will contact me again once they have the results. Yet, it has been three weeks and I have not heard from them. I assume that they have found a more suitable candidate.

Online test with 4 questions.

If you are interested in applying for a position with Facebook or you’re already engaged in the interviewing process, you may find my insight helpful.A Facebook recruiter contacted me within two week after submitting my resume to schedule an online writing sample. One week after I took the writing assessment, my recruiter contacted me to schedule a 30-minute phone interview.Takeaway#1: For the writing assessment, be clear, concise, and manage your…  time effectively.My first phone interview, which was more of a screening call, was with a Facebook recruiter. The call lasted around 30 minutes and entailed a discussion of my resume. She was very thorough and asked very detailed questions about all aspects of my experience. I was surprised at the level of detail sought, considering she didn’t work in the area for which I was applying. After the screening, she told me to expect a follow-up call from someone working in the department for which I applied.Takeaway#2: Be prepared to discuss your resume in detail and relate your experience to the Facebook job for which you are interviewing.The next day, a recruiting coordinator from the local Facebook office e-mailed me details for the next phone interview, which was with someone working in User Operations. This phone interview was more traditional and lasted around 30 minutes. I received an e-mail from my recruiter the next day inviting me to an on-site interview. I accepted.Takeaway#3: Know what Facebook is all about, express your excitement, and be prepared to articulate in detail what makes you a good fit for the position AND Facebook in general.The on-site recruiting coordinator contacted me to schedule the two-hour on-site interview. She also asked me to complete the Facebook employment application and nondisclosure agreement and bring both to the interview. Upon my arrival on-site, she took me to a very small room, with just enough room for three chairs, and asked me to wait for the first interviewer.The first interviewer arrived with her laptop in-hand, and proceeded to ask me standard interview questions, typing notes as I gave responses. The interview lasted 30 minutes. In fact, all subsequent interviews lasted 30 minutes.Takeaway#4: Be prepared to provide interesting stories about your most positive and negative work-related experiences, including lessons learned. Make sure you don’t throw anyone under the bus!The second interviewer’s questions were about personal and professional goals, why I was interested in Facebook, why I wanted to leave my job, etc.Takeaway#5: Be prepared to articulate the importance of life goals, why you’re interested in Facebook, what you will offer Facebook in the first 90 days/five years, and what skills you will take away from working at Facebook.The third interviewer’s questions focused on the position and asked philosophical questions about what role Facebook should play in ensuring safety on the site. He also asked for specific solutions to scaling User Operations support as the business continued to grow.Takeaway#6: Be prepared to offer suggestions for improving the Facebook user experience for both novices and experts.The final interviewer was older than the previous ones. The other interviewers were in their early 20s to very early 30s. I’m sure he was a manager in that office. His questions focused on team dynamics. This entailed what kind of team I prefer, what role I fill in a team, what I think is destructive for a team, etc.Takeaway#7: Be prepared to reveal professional criticism you received from peers while working on a team, and explain how you dealt with the criticism.This was the end of my interviewing experience with Facebook. The recruiting coordinator told me I should receive word from my recruiter in about a week. A week later, I received an e-mail from my recruiter indicating I was not the right fit.Final Takeaway: If you didn’t receive an offer, find something positive from the experience. It’s only natural to feel the sting of rejection when losing out on this kind of opportunity, but rest assured that you wouldn’t have made it that far in the interview process if you didn’t have the right skills. They simply found a personality that would be a better fit for the team they’re trying to build (or you were too old – kidding – sort of).My goal here is to share a more complete understanding of Facebook’s interview process so others may spend less time trying to anticipate the process and more time thinking about why they are right for Facebook.I am more than happy to share other aspects of my interviewing experience with Facebook. Feel free to ask questions in the comments section below...I will respond there so everyone has the benefit to learn from my experience. Remember, it’s anonymous…Note: Some things I will not be able to comment on due to my NDA with Facebook.

I really enjoyed the interview process for facebook! they are friendly, reliable and asked interesting questions!

I was first submitted an online test where I was asked three main questions both in English and foreign language (in this case, mother tongue):1) How could Facebook best gain new users in the EMEA region?2) Identify your favorite product/feature on Facebook and describe it to an end user3) An email translationAfter a series of phone interviews with HQ in Palo Alto (with recruiter, team leader, etc) I was invited…  for an onsite interview in Dublin, where I was interviewed by the Dublin team, which at the time was made up of only five people.The process was pretty straightforward and all the people I was interviewed by were really friendly and tried to create a laidback atmosphere. They were very focused on suggestions for improving Facebook product (almost every person I spoke with asked me this same question, by the end of the process I was exhausted to try to come up with new ideas every time I comfronted a different interviewer!!); they also wanted to know how to face the challenges they were encountering in EMEA region and ways to expand their user network in the country I had applied for.The interview seemed to go down really well and one member of the team even told me he was sure they'd see me around very soon which, TBH, made me believe the job was practically mine. When I thought the process had finally come to an end, I received another email from the recruiter scheduling AGAIN a final phone interview with Palo Alto. Eventually, after one month's waiting, I was phoned by the recruiter who told me that, though the team really liked me blablabla, they'd decided to go in for somebody else at the last moment. I felt quite disappointed at the time but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

I was asked to write a letter (as if it was for the website user) informing about the favourite FB application/feature. As I was applying for the position in a foreigh language, I was asked to write it in the particular language. The test was quite short - 20 mins. I never got to any following stages

**************************************Engineering Intern**************************************
In total I had two interviews: one on-campus interview with basic algorithm questions and a phone interview with somewhat more abstract questions.The interviewers liked their job, but were fairly closed about the actual work people do at Facebook. The hiring process is interesting in that they don't match you with a host until you start your internship.

First round HR interviewed with one simple puzzle and Algorithm questions. Complexity of some sorting algorithms. If the questions are not answered properly, they will ask you to solve a puzzle and send it across.The difficult puzzles from the link http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.phpMeal and buffet questions.

I was contacted by Facebook after finishing several of their puzzles puzzles. The first round phone screen from HR was non-technical. The second round was from a software engineer. There was one technical coding question, and we shared an online doc to write the code. I didn't do well, and received a rejection letter a few days later.

**************************************Contractor**************************************
Interviewing at Facebook for a contractor position has already been a tremendous experience. The employees I have encountered are welcoming, supportive and very knowledgable. Process went as follows: Initial screening, case study, interview loop with 3-4 people.

they seem rushed while interviewing but ask good question that are focused on your past work and what the job is. They also describe themselves first so that there is less tension. you are put in this little room so the 1 on 1 interviews are private which helps with the nerves

**************************************Computer Vision Engineer**************************************
Two technical phone screens with software engineers on the Oculus team followed by an onsite. The interview questions revolved primarily around generic SWE questions, nothing specific to CV. The hiring process was very good, the recruiters were friendly and super nice to accommodate me in their montreal offices. Interviews were fairly standard.

**************************************Account Manager**************************************
The procedure for the interviews was pretty straightforward. There were no tricky questions or overly complicated aspects to the overall process. The interviewers were nice and seemed to be genuinely excited about the company and what they were trying to achieve. I talked to a recruiter, the team lead, and to the individuals on the team.

I only got to the phone interview. It consisted of problem solving and situational questions dealing with advertisers. The recruiter asked a lot of compound questions at once. I had to listen carefully. I was told of the career opportunities at Facebook after answering them and to expect a decision in a week.

30 minute phone interview with questions regarding SMB. Was asked a bunch of questions from a manager in the specific office about why I wanted it and how I could drive impact through the company.

I applied online and then had a phone screening call. It was a fast process. The phone conversation was brief. I don't think I was taken any further in the process because I did not have any relevant experience.

This was a long and drawn process that included 8 total interviews. 4 of which were by phone and 4 were in an all day in person session. The first two interviews were phone screenings, the preceding ones were from different account managers. The onsite interview was with two account managers and 2 folks from different teams

Recruiter emailed to set up a phone screen. Did the phone screen with recruiter. Basic questions about employment history. Recruiter emailed me again to set up the next phone interview with person in the Account Manager position. Had interview with that person. Wanted to make sure I knew the basics of the product and how I would pitch it.

Very basic initial phone interview from a recruiter at Facebook. No questions were asked to be thrown off, general background information and resume review. Nothing unexpected. General review of past experience and general knowledge. Nothing even too specific to Facebook or the role in general.

Applied for an Account Manager position in early 2014 via an employee referral. The recruiter contacted me within in a week. After the initial phone screen, they set up a video interview with 4 team members. The video interview went smoothly. Interviewers mainly asked about my experience in advertising and client services; there were no curveball questions. After the video interview, the recruiter wouldn't return phone calls or emails from…  me so I assume the role was given to someone else.

They're helpful, respectful and incredibly organized. They're there to help you succeed and will do what it takes to get you in the door if you're the right fit.

Referred to by current FB employee and the process was very quick and took about 3 weeks total. I had 5 phone interviews and then a half day of in person interviews with team members at their Texas location. Recruiter was great at prepping you for the interview.

Its a thrilling email when you get an email from fb.com saying they're interested in you. The overall experience was good. I got my decision in 4 days of my on site interview.The interview style is definitely very different. They expect you to be an independent thinker, know the product and industry at expert level, and show energy.The most common question is simply, why do you want to work at…  Facebook. I don't think they want to hear you want to get rich.Expect to whiteboard, present case studies and show world class qualifications. The recruiter actually tells you this, so take it seriously.

A friend of a friend referred me for the position and a recruiter reached out to me to schedule an interview about a week later. I had a relatively easy 30 minute call with the recruiter, which she was 10 minutes late for, where I described my background, and learned a little more about the position. I was told I would have to speak with an employee in the position…  I was interviewing for, and then the next step would be to fly me down to Austin for an in-person interview (I'm currently in NY).A couple days later, I spoke with an Account Manager who asked relatively straightforward questions about my experience, and why I was interested in Facebook. Overall, I think it was a good conversation and I was able to develop a rapport. Things started to get a little weird after this point. After the call I asked the recruiter for the Account Manager's email so I could send a Thank You, to which I received a cold response that they couldn't disclose this information. I was then told I would have to have another phone interview with another Account Manager, and that this was "standard procedure" despite her saying different previously.My call with the second Account Manager went find. She was a little more cold and standoffish than the first one, but it may have just been the phone interview. The call seemed to go fine, more softball questions about my experience, what I thought of the Facebook advertising product, etc, etc. I didn't get as good a vibe this time, and followed up with the recruiter at the end of the week for next steps. I got an email Monday that they would not be going forward with me as a candidate with little insight as to why.My overall impression is that the HR department at Facebook is very young and inexperienced. Being late to my call gave me a bad first impression, and their rejection email referenced the incorrect names of the people I had interviewed with from their Account team. She also referenced a different position than the one I had applied to, and to which they were recruiting when I spoke with her - I applied for a job on their Agency team, and she said the position was on their Vertical team when we spoke, though when I spoke with the Account Managers they reverted back to treating it as a position with their Agency team. I'm sure part of it has to do with the fast pace which the company is growing, but I think they could do a lot more to treat their candidates respectfully.

Had an informal call with a recruiter that was trying to rush the process so it sounded like they were trying to move quickly. She told me the process consisted of a one on one phone interview followed by an in-person interview where I would meet 4 other employees. My phone interview was 2 weeks after my initial contact with the recruiter because there was a Global Sales Conference the…  following week and no one was in the office.When I had my one on one it was with a potential peer (NOT someone I would be reporting to) She had a similar background to mine and was very polite. Questions were relevant and not too difficult. I think in order to do well here, the interviewee has to be REALLY passionate about Facebook. If they don't get that sense, they will end up passing on you even if your experience and background fits like a glove. There's tons of people that are dying to work for this company so they can be picky.My tip is make sure you sound excited about the chance to work there. Also, I'm sure they screen your profile so make sure you hide any inappropriate pics or comments. They won't bring it up but you can't convince me otherwise that they don't look you up beforehand.

Ridiculously long and drawn out process. If you want a snot nosed Ivy League 22-year old telling you how the business world works, you should definitely interview here. I met with 8 different people, most of them were straight out of school, yet cocky as hell.

I applied at facebook several weeks before a current employee there recommended me to the talent recruiter. The interview process consisted of 1. Timed writing sample, 2. Phone screen conversation, 3. Phone Interview, 4. In person rotation interview (talking to 2-4 interviewers, each individually).Everyone involved in the interview process was very friendly and pleasant.

Process started over email and scheduling was very long and drawn out

applied online and received an email asking to complete writing skills sample - basically these were questions on facebook policies and work related scenarios for me to imagine myself in. In a couple of days, I was asked to provide some times for a phone interview.

Applied to a job as an Direct Response Account Manager via their website, and got an email from a Facebook recruiter 45 days later. Asked about my experience and knowledge of direct response advertising. I did not get a second round interview, but the recruiter referred me to another recruiter who was hiring for another job at Facebook.

I applied online in Facebook site and was called for the interview at the same day. It was just a phone call with the person from human resources. Not sure about the proccess, I did not have a chance to express my skills and how I would contribute for the role.

I applied online and was also referred. After a week or so, I got contacted by a first recruiter to arrange a phone call in the next following days. I specifically made sure to provide with my new phone number as I was moving to another country at this time (the recruiter did answer to the email).On the day of the interview, the recruiter tried to contact me on the…  wrong phone number, and we exchange emails at the same time to clarify everything out to make sure the person could contact me on the right number. Eventually, the recruiter decided to reschedule the call the next day to have enough time to chat and I did confirm. The next day, the recruiter just skipped the interview, without prior notice.I did follow up the next two weeks, no answer. I eventually got an email back from a different recruiter saying that they decided not to move forward with my application. Still a little surprised with how the candidacy was taken care of, did not seem very professional.

Submitted online application form and sent in CV. Got an Interview the following week with the program manager. The process went very quick and smoothly. The first email was just 10 questions about my willingness to move to Ireland, visa requirements and how I heard about the position.

Very smooth process overall and fairly quick. Recruiter wrote me on LinkedIn and we scheduled a first call to talk about my motives and FB as an employer. Scheduled the first interview with a Manager - Series of questions around FB, Workflows and my relevant experience, second part was to play through a typical client consult.Afterwards was invited to an onsite interview which was 3x30 Minutes and a presentation. I…  was booked into a very nice hotel, picked up at the airport by a cab and brought back the next day by the same. They took care of everything and even reimburse a good amount of the miscellaneous travel costs, like train tickets or food.The actual interview was really pleasant and efficient, every manager was excited to meet me and genuinely interested in getting to know me. The interview questions were not very challenging but that always depends on your level of confidence and experience - If you know what you are doing / talking about you will have a good time.

-Head hunted via linkedIn recruiter.-Screening phone interview by recruiter-Phone interview by general manager of the department-3 location interviews on site, and 1 presentationAll in all good experience with a lot of helpful employees. Questions were somehow pretty standard compared to other types of interviews, and you might expect a company like Facebook to be more creative and less rigid.

First, I had a telephone call with a recruiter for basic screening, the second interview was a video conference with a manager for more technical knowledge and sales experience but also a screening. After that I had three interviews at the FB office where more knoledge and experience questions where asked as well as some case questions, at the end I had two negotiation calls, bacground checks and reference checks.

HR contacted me for a phone screening and immediately I had another phone interview with the manager. Finally, they gave me a topic for me to prepare 30min presentation through Bluejean website.

Had 1st call with the recruiter. Asked basic questions like describe your current role, why facebook, what do you love most about your job. Basic questions and recruiter was nice. Unfortunately no follow up.

First I had a screening interview with the Recruiter. Nice and easy going not too hard.Then I had an interview with a manager. Still easy going, focused more on how I would approach the position.I was lucky to get invited to onsite interviews in Dublin. I was asked to prepare a 10 min./5 slide powerpoint presentation of a high level marketing strategy. Additional I was asked to prepare a mock…  call. Additionally I had a regular interview in Dublin.Everybody was super friendly. All expenses was paid and they were friendly and helpful. My recruiter was able to answer question throughout the process.

I was contacted on LinkedIn by a recruiter. Then 4 calls followed:1) he called me to talk about the role.2) he called me to ask some screening questions3) a manager called me to ask the "tough" questions about how I would act in the role4) the recruiter called me and told me i didnt get it (the response was delayed for more than a week)

30 min phone interview with recruiter-->30 min phone interview with team manager -->30minute presentation interview with team manager--> on-site interviewthe phone interviews were basic.I had prepared everything in English, but the hiring people had no interest in asking me questions in English, which totally threw me off.The presentation interview was intense. They ask questions based on your presentation, and of real life situations.

Interviewer was not interested to hire you but trying to find out some strategies on how to overcome certain market based on your past experience and company. I guess they are clueless on how to grow the business.

Phone interview HR, Phone interview hiring manager, Personal interview with 3 person. The last round was really intensive! The panel is trying to understand your real motivation to join Facebook and to understand what drives you.

I applied online for the role of Account Manager (International). After a few weeks, I was invited to a phone interview, which went quite smoothly (typical questions about my background). Then, I was invited to take a language test and to record myself answering 4 questions. Then, the process stopped for over a month due to an internal restructuring. When the process resumed, it had been handed over to a…  different interviewer, to whom my CV was passed on. This next interviewer contacted me in order to arrange another phone interview. This time around, the process was a lot quicker – just one phone call and I was invited to Facebook's HQ in Dublin for an interview day. All expenses were paid for by the company except for meals and transportation.I arrived at Dublin on a Sunday and the interview day was on Monday. It was super-quick – less than 2 hours and 4 interviewers from Account Management, Partner Management, Client Services and the Regional Director. In my opinion, the questions they asked were too thoughtful and mind-draining for such little time and the position itself, and honestly, sometimes I did not know how to answer them. The hardest part was the last one with the regional director. I sensed from the first moment he didn't enjoyed being there. "Tell me something that's not in your CV", "Why should I hire you", "Do you like football." I asked what was he looking for in a candidate and his answer was "we're looking for bold people who can make an impression." (As if he just read that.) After we were finished, he simply left the meeting room and I had to find my way to the exit from a 3rd floor myself, and to the airport.But other than that, it was an interesting experience although it felt like getting the on-site interview was just a matter of luck.

Had 5 interviews all up, 1 with the recruiter (phone), then 4 on-site back to back 30 min interviews. Was quite an intense process all up

I uploaded my resume online and just a couple of days afterwards I got an email inviting me to do a phone interview. The first Interview was with someone from the HR team. The intervieweer was very nice and mostly asked about my experiences and my understanding of the role. At the end of the conversation I was told that the team manger would call me also and also what…  I should prepare for this next conversation. The team manger went more in depth with the questions.

Received a request on LinkedIn from a Facebook International Recruiter (based in Palo Alto). Was informed that Facebook is seeking an Account Manager for Online Sales Operations in Singapore. Wanting to understand further (and passion for social media), I consented to a phone interview. The first phone interview was from an International Recruiter and the call was mainly to highlight the responsibilities of the job. Questions asked were mainly open-ended…  questions about myself and thoughts on the company.My second phone interview came a week after. The interviewer was a Sales Associate and her questions duly appraised my areas of expertise and suitability for the position. Questions this time around involved hypothetical scenarios ("What will do to convince your client to invest in FB Ads", "How would you prioritize 50 clients?").Was informed a week after with regards to my 3rd phone interview, this time from an Account Manager based in Texas. Her questions were mainly related to the position and consist of hypothetical and behavioral questions ("What are your strengths/weaknesses", "How can you improve FB ads", "Say you are the account manager for XXX, how do you sell FB ads to them"?.Received an email a couple of days later for an on-site interview with my potential colleagues. The office has quite a bit of communal space and the setup encourages interactions among colleagues - as expected from coming from FB. The session was split into three 1-on-1 interviews and aside from personal queries, some key questions asked were, "Who are our competitors?", "How can we improve FB ads?", "Advantages of FB ads compared to our competitors".Although I did not receive the offer, overall it was a positive and enriching experience. Would recommend FB to anyone who wishes to pursue a career in the field of social media.

The process was fairly standard and straight forward. I applied online and got a call from the recruiter based in California. She was very nice and extremely helpful and responsive. She prepped me up well for the upcoming interviews. I was then scheduled for 3 more phone interviews.The first two went very well and the recruiter called me again to check in and give some good and immediate feedback on…  my interviews so far. The last call was with a girl from Texas. From the onset, it appeared that she had a closed mind and only wanted to hear answers which she thought were appropriate. I don't think she had any working experience in Asia to be expecting to hear what I said. Throughout the interview, she was generally not interested to hear anything apart from her 22-yards and she was extremely cold. This was the exact opposite of what I had experienced so far. Needless to say, by the time the call got over I had a feverish feeling that I won't be getting the job and that is exactly what happened.I hope FB takes in to account that while having a diverse set of peers interview you, they should appoint individuals with an open mind, rather than standoffish.

Received an email saying that someone from HR would be calling for a phone interview. No call was ever received, but about a week and a half later I received an email instructing me to take an online essay prompt. After completing and submitting the essays, I was contacted by email saying that I did not recieve the position. At no point, did anyone contact me by phone, nor respond…  to any emails.

I had only 1 interview with the recruiter who contacted me within 3 days after my online application. She sounded very professional over the phone setting the framework for the interview. Do be prepared for questions relating to adverstiments, campaign ads on Facebook, how does Facebook differ from Google and Yahoo and what makes Facebook so unique.

First interview with the recruiter. Basic interview questions were asked.Second interview was with someone on the team. More in depth questions (based on experience) were asked.Waited around a week before getting rejected for on site interview. I was told they were looking for someone more experienced and could work directly off being hired.

Gruelling, intensive. However it was great to meet all of the team and learn more about the workplace this way.

I applied online and received a an email after two days to schedule a phone interview.The first arrangement didn't work out and the interview was rescheduled.The interview consisted of basic questions about my background, and questions related to advertising on Facebook. The call was of a bad quality and I did not hear the questions properly.

Initially, I was dealt with by a fantastic recruiter in Palo Alto, who walked me through the process, and asked me probing questions to ensure I was applying to Facebook for the right reasons. I then went through an arduous process of multiple interviews over 6 months, which meant by the end of the process, I hadn't actually learnt a huge amount about the company, but they'd learnt a lot…  about me. After 6 months, they deferred my application, and put me on hold. Eventually, I got the job.

Intéressant, un peu long, mais les recruteurs sont bienveillants. Il faut bien se préparer, autrement c'est compliqué. Le premier phone screening est facile, les entretiens métier sont plus compliqués. Je me suis déplacé a Dublin, et le rdv avec le manager s'est pas très bien passé.

Wie andere Techfirmen ist der Bewerbungsprozess sehr umfangreich. Ich hatte gespraeche mit einbem Recruiter, dann ein Telefoninterview, dann drei Interviews in Dublin und zum Schluss noch einmal ein Telefoninterview. Facebook war sehr nett, freundlich und wirklich bemueht um mich. Die Gespraeche liefen wie erwartet, Schwerpunkte vor Ort: analytische faehigkeiten, Cultural Fit, Role Specific.

The Facebook interview process can be quite lengthy as it involves several people and steps.I applied through an employee referral for 2 different roles, and heard back about one of them quite quickly. I went through the process again for the 2nd role after the 1st was completed.I had a preliminary phone screening with the recruiter, then a phone screening with the hiring manager and 4 onsite interviews on both…  occasions.Onsite interviews are with both management and peers (from the same team or other team).I had an extremely positive experience with both recruiters. They both came across as present and committed to the candidates success. They were proactive and provided targeted input and feedback. Even after the interview outcomes, they both took the time to make a phone call to provide feedback on the interviews.There is no formula for the onsite interviews, all of the interviewers have different styles.Some of the interviewers came across as not fully calibrated. Overall the experience was positive in both occasions, it is not easy to impress so many different people, with such different styles.

**************************************Software Engineer (internship)**************************************
I sent my resume through a friend who works for the company and was addressed by mail regarding it in the very next day. I was then asked by phone a few technical questions about my availability in the summer, the languages I prefer to code in etc, and set a phone interview for 2 days later.

**************************************Community Operations (Market Specialist)**************************************
Stages: test, interview with HR, 3-4 interviews with team members and managers. The stages are clear and transparent, and each interview focuses on different topic so you don't get to answer the same thing again and again. They don't ask generic CV-related questions; the questions are more role-based or competence-based. However, it's obvious that the interviewers have perused your CV prior to the interview. I felt appreciated and no time…  was wasted during the whole process.

**************************************Sales Function**************************************
10 rounds of interviews and presentations. This is one company that does not know what they want and cannot make up their mind if they are looking for alternate skills set or complimentary experience.

**************************************Production Engineer Summer2017 (London Office)**************************************
I applied through career website. After a week I got an email from the recruiter asking me for the further information about my education and experiences. After submitting necessary documents she didn't reply me for the next fifteen days. I sent her reminder and got the positive reply from her. She took my first interview around of 15mins. She asked me questions related to my motivation, experiences and also ask…  a few systems admin and networking questions.After that, she didn't respond to me for the next three weeks. I again sent her reminder regarding my application and got the positive reply.My next round was a coding interview. Where recruiter asked me few questions related to my CV and then asked me two coding questions.1. File parsing and sorting2. Check if host is up or notIt was such a bad experience with him. He was not clear for some of the questions. He was doing some other stuff when I was coding. From the starting he was in rush, he didn't give proper time to code or even didn't discuss the proper test cases of a program with me. He just put some questions on the text area and just asked me what is your approach? Even he didn't run my code or didn't check it syntactically or logically.After an hour I got the rejection. Still, I don't know what he was expecting from coding round or why I got the rejection. My entire process took around 2 and half months and during that, they just took my two interviews. Totally unhappy with the Facebook's recruitment process.

**************************************Software Engineer Intern - Graduate**************************************
I contacted by a recruiter at a career fair. Then, I had an e-mail asking my available time. I was a bit busy those days, the interview was scheduled almost two weeks later from that time. I should say I do not have any experience related to interviewing for an intern position, I never know what I will be asked. During the interview, I had explained what I did up…  to now, I was expecting to have questions about my study, but interviewer does not express any interest to my study.

**************************************User Interface Engineer**************************************
I really liked the process.

My Facebook interview process might be described in a single word... lengthy :) The process could drag on at times, but to be fair, this all happened around the time of the IPO and the campus move to Menlo Park, so in a very real sense it's a wonder it moved along at all. My (generally very positive) experience went like this:1. Recruiter phone screen with questions about my background…  and a few simple technical questions.2. 8-hour programming test to be completed within one week.3. 2 or 3 (I forget exactly) 1-hour online coding tests, where the interviewer watches you code remotely in real time.4. 4 more technical interviews at the Menlo Park Facebook HQ.Everyone was very polite and helpful throughout the process. By the end I felt like I had forged a new friendship with my recruiting team, who were all great about keeping me informed, especially towards the end of the process. Travel to Facebook HQ for the onsite was well-managed - I stayed at a nearby hotel and all local travel was reimbursed. The onsite lunch was very good :)The four onsite interviews all had the same format: maybe 10-15 minutes on interviewer/interviewee backgrounds, 20-25 minutes for a technical interview (all involved coding with a marker on a whiteboard), and some time reserved at the end for general questions the interviewee might have about FB. All interviewers were technically very sharp, as one might expect, though I experienced absolutely none of the of supposed Facebook arrogance that some reviewers have reported. They're very good and expect you to be very good, which is fair, but nobody was rude.I won't reveal any particular questions, but I'll say that none were terribly "computer sciency" in nature. You'll obviously want to be able to write hand-coded Javascript/HTML/CSS with some facility, to understand how different browsers load & interpret your code and render pages, to explain how the web works in general, etc. You should be prepared to discuss various tradeoffs between different approaches to solving UI Engineering problems. You should be able to defend the code you write, predict how it will behave, and make amendments if the requirements change a bit.The 8 hour programming test was by far the most difficult coding question. I don't know if my submission was perfect but I sure wrote a hell of a lot of tests and tried to break it every way I could think of before sending it in.There were no "gotcha" questions, which I've seen on almost every other interview I've been on in my career (e.g., add the numbers 1-100 in your head; name as many table-related HTML elements as you can, what are all the HTTP verbs, etc). Questions were mostly of the "implement this" format, with a somewhat broad description of some interaction model.It's worth noting that I was explicitly invited to provide feedback on Glassdoor, which I feel reflects positively on the FB culture.

I applied through the website, but got no response, so I headed to LinkedIn to find an HR rep for Facebook. About a month after I emailed, I was contacted by a rep and asked a few basic questions, a standard initial interview. One unusual thing about the interview was that it began with him asking me if I had any questions about Facebook, which is usually left for the…  end of the interview. He then sent me a puzzle to solve, which took about 8-10 hours -- another user on glassdoor.com said he also completed (a calendar-type puzzle) -- and a few days later I received a call to set up another interview. I interviewed with one of the other UI Engineers, who seemed very friendly. He asked me to do some live coding to some problems he provided through collabedit. Once again, I was asked if I had any other questions. A few days later, I received another email about setting up a third interview with yet another UI Engineer (their UI engineer staff is currently around 10, so this seemed a bit unusual to interview with another of the team). I declined after that interview.

**************************************Performance and Capacity Engineer**************************************
I applied online, and within a few weeks a recruiter followed up with me to do an initial screen. After the screening, I had a phone interview with a team lead for the performance and capacity engineering group. After that phone call, they decided to fly me out to Menlo Park for a full day of interviews.I met with 6 people at Facebook's main campus. Each interview was about 45…  minutes and had a different focus:- Coding interview, where the goal is to come up with a solution as fast as possible (on a whiteboard).- System design.- Probability and statistics.- Culture fit.Everyone I met was very pleasant and friendly, and the recruiters were quite helpful throughout the process, almost acting as a sort of coach.Less than a week after the on-site interview, the recruiter contacted me to tell me they would be moving forward with other candidates.When I asked for feedback, I was told I didn't perform well enough on the coding exercise (though I did solve both problems, but perhaps I wasn't fast enough?).

There was an initial phone call with the hiring manager to assess job fit, followed by a phone screen interview, and an all-day interview gauntlet on-site in Menlo Park. Despite things seeming like a good fit for my software and DBMS optimization skills during the phone discussions, it turned out that the group was interested in low-level hardware design issues (e.g., optimal cache-line sizing).

**************************************CSM**************************************
Apply)Paper )call interview )hiring manager's call )more than 7 on site interviews.)Overall it has been hard but gr8 experience to learn about their company and me. Through this interview, I was able to understand values that Facebook uphold. Not to mention, I was very impressed with the philosophy and values of Facebook.

**************************************Senior Engineer**************************************
Phase 1Initial emails exchangedPhone interviewSeveral (5) 1:1 interviews over 2 daysOffer (3 weeks after 1:1 interviews)Declined offerPhase 2 - a year laterExpressed I was still interested1:1 interview with team leaderSeveral (4) 1:1 interviews over 2 daysOffer (3 weeks after 1:1 interviews)NegotiatedAccepted offer

Very thorough. Covers technical, personality, etc. There were four interviewers, broken into two coding questions, one architecture question, and one person who covered fit and personality. The interviewers were all very professional, and the recruiter was a pleasure to interface with.

**************************************Equity Programs Analyst**************************************
Applied through the website, was contacted by recruiter. Set-up initial 15-min call to discuss position (she called 15 minutes late but was at least nice about it). Then talked with another HR person prior to scheduling on-site interview. 3-hour interview with 6 different people (three team members, hiring manager, one HR, one payroll). Since job was more corporate the questions were of no surprise; was basically a typical interview asking…  about challenges, overcoming problems, strengths, why I wanted the job, and giving me an idea of the Facebook culture. 3 hours was a bit long and since it was 10 AM - 1 PM, it breezed right through lunch. I would have liked to try out the cafeteria however I was just offered a few snacks prior to leaving. Some of the interviewers probably could have tag-teamed instead of doing all 1-on-1 because it was a tiny bit repetitious by the end, but overall fine.

**************************************Sourcing Manager**************************************
3 phases of interview; phone from Recruiter, met with hiring manager but was not selected for panel interview. Should have been more prepared and done more research to respond to expected questions for the position. Impromptu interview with peer was unexpected.

Very efficient . Phone interview first , then in Person first interview with Hiring manager & then panel interview . very thoughtful process during long hours of panel interview

linkedin application, hr emails to setup time and talk, but follow up is not quite much; maybe it's better to have referrel from the company otherwise a bit difficult to get thier intrests

**************************************Quantitative Analyst- People Analytics**************************************
I applied through an employee referral and the process took 2 weeks.The recruiter contacted me the day after my resume was internally referred. Set up a call a couple of days later for a short chat (15 mins) about the nature of the job, my general qualifications and backgrounds, and continued interest in the position. I was immediately notified I'd be moved to the next interview, a 45 minute phone…  interview with the head of the team. The recruiter was very informative about the subject of the call (statistics, statistical methods/concepts) and background of the interviewer. Interview went well.Fifteen minutes after that interview concluded, the recruiter called me, asked me how I felt it went, and informed me I'd be moving toward a second (45-minute) phone interview. The call was scheduled for the following week and again, I was informed on the subject of the interview (advanced stats, probability, and live syntax for data management) as well as the background of the interviewer (quantitative engineer). The call went well, though I did stumble a little bit over the syntax (I'd just taught myself over the weekend), but not because it was difficult.A week later I was informed my interviews went generally well, but unfortunately I didn't make it to the next round. My background is in org psychology, and I think they were looking for someone with more engineering/computer programming experience. Overall, very pleasant experience working through the process.

**************************************Partner Manager**************************************
The most professional yet very stringent recruiting process I've ever been through. In summary: Phone screening with recruiter and hiring manager, followed by a series of on-site interviews, case analysis + presentation, and video conferences with HQ folks (I was an overseas office candidate). Additional conversations may be added. All interviewers put a lot of effort to the process to assess the candidate's all-around professional experience and personal character. Everybody…  was courteous and professional but the expectation was certainly very high as well.

**************************************Procurement Coordinator**************************************
The interview process took too long. I got a call from the recruiter then it took over 3 weeks to get a response to schedule a phone screen. Afterward, I got scheduled for another phone interview with the hiring manager. It took about 1-2 weeks to hear back on the next step. Unfortunately, I didn't make it to the next round. However, the next round would be to fly to…  its headquarter to interview with the hiring team. Then the final interview will be with business partners.

**************************************Media Solutions Specialist**************************************
I was first contacted by a recruiter from the New York office (I was applying for a job in Austin). She did a basic phone interview and gave me tips for the next phone interview with a member of the team in Austin. After that interview I was asked to come in for an in person interview consisting of four 30-minute interviews. Again, the recruiter gave me "tips" about what…  to expect during this process. Nothing she told me was accurate in terms of how the interview actually went. This recruiter was also very flakey, telling me she would call me at a certain time to discuss the interview and never did and not telling me the time my second phone interview was scheduled for (catching me off guard when at work I was called for a phone interview).Overall, the process felt very unorganized and I did not feel prepared for the in person interview based on misinformation from the recruiter.

Contacted by Recruiter. Informal phone interview. Interview at office with four members of the Media Solutions Team, held consecutively ranging approximately 30 minutes. Each interviewer represented different facets of interests and skills sets. Interview one seemed to gauge client management/sales ability. The second was to deduce if I was a team player. The third individual asked the technical skill set questions. The final interviewer was the traditional top manager interview.

Interview involve about 3-8 steps, where all round skill, strengths and few other things are thoroughly discussed.

**************************************Qualitative Researcher**************************************
I initially spoke with a recruiter on the phone re a position at Instagram. I was screened and provided my credentials, plus an example of my work (a presentation submitted online). After a week or so, the recruiter suggested an opening at Facebook that was well-suited to my background. I then proceeded to interview with three current FB researchers via phone over a week-long period. Each interview went well &…  progressed from initial screening to a longer phone interview. Thought it went well, then I didn't hear back. I recall reaching out to recruiter for feedback, but don't think I received any!

**************************************Python Dev**************************************
Got call on experience basis(On contract), Written Round,for Python Developer post Written round is compulsory at Facebook This job is about Facebook Advertisement reach calculation.(Facebook India Online Services Pvt Ltd.,Hyderabad)

**************************************Software Development**************************************
A friend referred me and I heard back from a recruiter immediately. Over the next two weeks I did two phone screens, and a week after that I heard back that I passed and would be moving on to the team matching process.As this was for a PhD internship, they spent the next two weeks gathering team hosts to interview with, and finally settled on a date for 3 interviews…  with potential hosts. They told me as long as at least one team wanted me, I would have an internship. The day of the interview comes, I have an hour long talk with three different teams, all of which I thought went great (two of them even verbally said they would love to have me and to hear a follow-up shortly). I was ecstatic at the thought of interning for Facebook, and the recruiter told me I would hear back a decision in two business days.Well I didn't hear back in a two days. The recruiter messaged me a week later that it would take a bit longer to make a decision. One evening a week after that I get a copy pasted response from recruiter about how Facebook will be not be moving forward with an offer and that there were many qualified candidates this year.Shame on the recruiter for not keeping to original timeline. Shame on the teams for lying to me about joining their team. It's good to know they put off my decision to hire these "more qualified candidates". Given how I thought the whole process went very well, just to be pushed aside at the very end, means I will never be applying to Facebook again. There was no trust or transparency at the end.

I had applied during the career fair and got a call after 10 days. The interview was on campus. The interviewer was very kind, helping me throughout. Overall a good experience.

Facebook held an in-person interview at university, wherein 4 interviewers went through candidates in hour intervals. Following this, 2nd round candidates were flown out for on-site interview in Menlo Park, during which they were shown around the Facebook campus and performed an hour-long interview with a software developer.

I talked to a recruiter on a career fair at my university. One week later I got an email to schedule my on-campus interview. It was about 30 minutes. The interviewer was very nice. Then after about a two weeks I was informed that I didn't make it.

I applied through Facebook's website, and received an email from a recruiter within the next week or two. She had me send in my availability, and then scheduled a phone interview. During the interview, I talked on the phone and coded in a collaboration site in my browser. The interview consisted of two technical questions, and that was it. I finished the first question, but could not finish the second…  question.

In campus first round interview. I gave my resume to one of the recruiter. They schedule an interview next week. The interview questions are not hard, but I didn't do well because I didn't prepare for it. There are two questions, compute square root and k-select problem. I got an e-mail from the recruiter that I was rejected that night.

It was the first round interview on phone for a full-time position. Half of the interview was behavioral and half was a coding exercise where you had to write a running program. The whole interview process was decent and there were multiple recruiting people involved in contacting me so was a bit messy.

**************************************Account Manager Online Sales**************************************
Well first of all you would think Facebook would have this process down to a science, but it was so disorganized and HR girl from Austin was very rude and unreliable.- First I sent in my resume on the Facebook job site.- Got an email to fill out 3 questions.- Then got an email from HR Austin saying they would call me at 9 am which she called at 9:20am  She…  asked me basic questions about the job, but I felt like she had a "i know it all attitude" and kept asking me to repeat what I said, I think she was trying to fill out a form on what I was saying. It was like a bad phone reception interview, please repeat etc etc. lol very odd.- Then she told me I would get another phone interview from someone in the main HQ and would email me the day and time. She asked if I was available Weds or Thurs. I said yes, she said she would email me before then. --- Thurs came around and never got an email. So, I emailed her asking about it and she set it up the next day.- Got the call the next day - the girl was very nice and knowledgeable. The interview went really good in both directions. I really was sure I had an in person interview next. She said to contact the same HR girl from Austin.- A week went by and I got an email from her and she wrote that I fit the part, but they have alot of candidates and I would not be moving forward with me.In all honesty I was shocked. I'm not sure if its the HR in Austin or Facebook, but it was an odd experience and felt like something is going on with the interviews or the process. Very strange. I thought this from really talking with the HR girl that thought she knew it all.Yea I would of loved to work at Facebook, but after going with the interview process, not so much. I wouldn't wanna work with people like that, but the girl from the main HQ was super nice and understood what I was saying. :) Wish HR didn't make some decisions cause I really have the talent and I'm 25 :) lolBye bye Facebook, Here comes Twitter!!!!!Ps: I think some really good employees would not be getting hired the way the process and HR is.

**************************************Critical Facility Tech (Contract)**************************************
A few technical questions that I answered correctly followed by some personal "what do you like to do?" questions, then a tour of the facility. I thought it went very well, however I was wrong because I received the "we not going to move forward" email before I made it five minutes down the road. The prompt notice is definitely appreciated but at the same time, it left me feeling…  confused and mislead about the whole interview.

**************************************Platform Stability Engineer Intern**************************************
Got a mail from university recruiter saying there is a profile match and background checks have been already completed . Two rounds of phone interviews on successful dates. First Round had just one technical question (Search a Tree) and rest all were behavioral . Second round was also very similar. (Reverse a string).

**************************************Critical Facility Engineer**************************************
I had several phone interviews with recruiters and site technicians. When chosen as one of the final group of candidates, I was invited to 6 45 min. interviews in one day. Some were done in person and some video phone.

**************************************Market Analyst**************************************
Very unprofessional , received emails at 11 PM , got called on the wrong day for the phone interview... I was always sent back an forth between 2 different people in charge of the recruiting . It was simply a total mess .. Very deceived

**************************************Escalations Specialist**************************************
Initial call with a recruiter was a good one. Quick talk about my background and why I wanted to apply. Then I received a writing assessment in the language I applied for (30 minutes, 1 question) next call was scheduled for a week later. I received advice and links to check from the recruiter. The call with a peer wad a hard one. Not a native English speaker questioned me…  in a straight forward way. She didn't explained the next steps and I had chase the results myself.

Total of 6 interview rounds. First 2 are phone screening and the next 4 were on-site interviews (3 over video-call and 1 face-to-face). The first call was just to understand my job profile better and get to know what exactly I am into. The second call is a screening round, to test whether I would be able to face the actual interview rounds. The rest 4 interviews are with people…  involved with the process and who have a better idea about the skills required for the job.

The phone interview with a recruiter was easy, she was helpful and friendly. Later, I had an online language assesment test for two languages (German and Turkish). There was an essay question which was not hard. However, the time was too limited to write essays in two languages.

**************************************User Operations Specialist**************************************
2 part interview process - 1 over the phone and 1 in-person interview onsite. The phone interview was first screened by Facebook's on recruiting agency. It was very thorough and lasted about 20 - 25 minutes where it primarily focused on your problem-solving skills and judgement calls. The in-person interview was a little casual and asked a lot of scenario-based questions and how well you knew Facebook's goals.

**************************************Analyst, Online Sales Operations**************************************
I was first asked to take a time writing test, which lasted an hour. I was asked a few questions like "Why Facebook" and "Would you permit tobacco advertising on a localized basis, or globally?"

**************************************Head of Facilities**************************************
Phone interviews with HR recruiter. After that, in-person interviews with Global Head of Real Estate and Regional Heads of Real Estate, and Regional Head of HR. Also interviews with Regional Head of Sales and Regional Head of Real Estate over video conference. HR asked very thought provoking questions which were more theoretical. Others were what I would call normal interview questions.

**************************************Stagiaire en Ingénierie des Logiciels**************************************
J'ai postulé sur la page d'offres de stages de Facebook en joignant seulement mon CV et j'ai reçu un mail un mois plus tard pour me poser des questions complémentaires. Rien de très compliqué, juste des questions à propos de moi, de mes études, de mon langage de programmation favori, etc... J'ai ensuite fixé une date pour une cession de codage de 45 minutes au cours de laquelle on m'a…  posé deux questions :- Donnez tous les sous-ensembles possible d'un ensemble ou d'un ensemble des parties d'un ensemblePar exemple : si un ensemble de trois éléments {1,2,3} est donné, tous les sous-ensembles possible sont :{} Ensemble vide{1,2,3} L'ensemble complet lui-même{1}{2}{3}{1,2}{2,3}{1,3}- Trouvez trois éléments dans un tableau qui, additionnés, égalent 0

**************************************Client Solutions Manager DACH**************************************
first phone screen by recruiter, second call by manager, thirsd call by another manager, forth onsite interview in dublin with 4 interviews incl. presentation, fifth feedback and offer. i got accompanied by a recruiter from the first to the last step. it was a very smooth process with all costs covered.

**************************************Software Engineer**************************************
phone interview starting with introducing yourself followed by two code questions.The first coding question is very standard coding question and the second one isa little more related to facebook's certain functionality

This was my first phone interview. The interviewer started with introducing himself and in a minute we started our technical interview. Only one question was asked. After listening to my various approaches, he kept on adding more and more constraints.

I talked to some engineers when Facebook visited my college. About a month or two later, I received an email from HR and got a phone technical interview the following week. Everything went smoothly and everybody was very polite.

As far as difficulty, interview was pretty standard. Facebook has a very low tolerance for bugs/mistakes, so definitely test hard!Having received offers from major companies (Google, Microsoft and Amazon) and having 8+ years experience at one of these, I feel reasonably confident in saying I wasn't challenged. Instead, the whole process felt like an exam, and most interviewers behaved like examiners, not collaborators.There was very little discussion or debate. During…  4 coding rounds, the interviewers took a backseat right after they gave me the problem statement. After I was done coding, the interviewers examined my code and stated their objections to it, such as:- There's a wrong variable name that won't let your code compile- Please don't use your own utility functions, I've provided you with a few- Your code doesn't meet my contract exactly (I did implement an optimization, with the verbal agreement that the client didn't need the extra data)- In my system design round, I was asked to scale out a complicated data structure. I did make reasonable progress, but the interviewer and I were playing catch-up for the entire interviewTwo interviewers told me to implement a 'silly' protocol, or a 'silly' class. This clearly makes it an exam, and not a true discussion/debate since it is not possible to make many logical arguments.

Quick 15min phone screen w/ recruiter. Recruiter asked some multiple choice questions about Android development. Approved me for next stage with technical phone screen interview. Sent email with lots of interview prep material. Technical phone screen interview was setup with a screenshare platform where I was asked two different algorithm type questions. First question was rather easy and involved a standard hash table. Second question involved bit manipulation which I…  had not expected. Even the interviewee had trouble giving me hints/help. Was not accepted for the next stage onsite interview.

I had two interviews. Both over the phone where I coded on a coder pad document. During my first interview I was asked a LeetCode medium question. The interviewer was nice. During my second interview I was asked to implement a certain Facebook feature. My second interviewer was extremely friendly. Also my recruiter was awesome. I haven't accepted the offer, but it's definitely being highly considered based off of the…  way I was treated.

Was shortlisted after talking to them at the career fair and the recruiter was in touch throughout the process. Was called for a persona interview for 45 minutes. We talked about my past work for three minutes and then moved on to the coding question. Interviewer was helpful.

A brief discussion with the team member about the target program. Then there is a online coding problem on sorted array about medium difficulty and a following problem about it.

There are5 minutes resume problems(based on your projects list in your resume and what kind of tech you use in this project) and self introduction and 40 minutes coding with a shared editor, finally there are 5 minutes for you to ask problems .

Background questions using my resume. Then coding questions (USE LEETCODE PREMIUM) . Then I asked questions about working at Facebook. The interviewer was very nice. That was it for the interview.

Applied through internal referral. Got notified about interview in less than three days. Scheduled interview a few weeks later. Had phone interview with an engineer. The interviewer was friendly and gave hints whennI was stuck. Was asked a lot of time complexity questions.

Skype Interview. A software engineer in ads team interview me. We introduce our background to each other at first. Then he asked me two algorithm problems. Not very hard. But I am nervous and may fail it

Hr find my resume and I pass the easy phone interview. However the onsite is terrible. One of the interviewer is an Indian, he just gave me the question and started to play on his phone. This is system design stage and I have to comform some uestions. But he did not even look at me. I have to weite down and speak to my self. After 50 minutes, he…  did not even talked to me then went out! How can they find such oeople do the system design interviewing?!

Since I had interviewed on-site before, they directly brought me on-site this time. I had 4 interviews: 1 behavior, 2 coding and 1 design. I have 12 years experience. All interviews went well in my mind, but surprisingly, no offer. No feedback given. I feel it was because one of the interviewers wasn't that nice and was quiet through most of the interview. While I wrote on the whiteboard and…  talked out loud, he was mostly on his laptop and barely responded. They tell you to think of the interviews as a discussion with a coworker. Well it was definitely not an engaging or pleasant coworker at all. Makes you wonder if the interviewer decided your fate as soon as he met you because he didn't like you. I have launched many successful products with many customers. None of that is taken into account in this kind of hiring process.

1. phone interview from HR2. onsite:  ask about the education background and related coursework  ask about the projects mentioned in the resume  give a question about binary tree and test the coding ability  first ask to describe your method and logistics  then write code on the white board

It was on skype call, first round with recruiter, second with Software engineer from California office, it lasted for fourty five minutes, first he introduced himself and then I did the same, told about my masters programme. then the interview happened through shared text editor link.

Technical phone screen, short background on interviewer, myself, then tech question. Had a call with recruiter to go over the process. Had the opportunity to go to a CTCI class to prepare

H.R contacts me and scheduled a phone screen pretty quick. Was expected some algorithm questions but did not really prepared much. Interviewer is quite friendly but being asked a question i never saw. Figured out a solution that does not work on all circumstance.Still do not quite agree this type of algorithm only interview especially for guys with 5+ year experience and family/kids. Since these algorithm questions are not used…  during day to day work, it quite difficult to spend that much time to practice in leetcode.

Interview process is well-organized and conveyed professionally. Be ready to be surprised by questions. Do your homework. For software engineers, try to dig a bit into how they do stuff at Facebook. There will be very specific questions they gonna ask. The difficulty is to be calm down and devote yourself to think about the questions. Don't try to recall some problems that you've resolved, it may waste your time.

Interview process was good. The interviewer was very helpful. He told about himself and what he does there. He explained the question in detail and gave ample amount of time to think and solve the problem.

Phone interview, I was very confused as to what the interviewer was saying. I was called sharply on time, and was introduced by the guy who leads the mobile apps. His question to me was very confusing and I did not know exactly what he was asking me for, but as he explained through examples I got a good gist of what he was asking. This however, took a lot…  of time, and I lost a lot of time to do my test.

Applied via refer, in the first phone screen, I was asked to introduce myself, then comes two coding question, did it on code pad, I got the both answer right but didn't pass the interview.

We had four rounds of coding interview and one of them is behavior interview. The interviews mainly focus on basic data structure and algorithm questions. After the interviews, they took us for a lunch, and a tour of Facebook HQ.

The process takes about 1 month. Referred by a friend. The interview questions are not hard and easy to prepare. 2 rounds of technical interviews and 1 round of team match interview. The technical interviews are easy to prepare. LeetCode will be helpful. In the team match interview, interviewer asked me about my research projects.

applied through referral, got a phone interview with 3 simple coding questions, invited onsite for one 45 minute interview and a tour day of the HQ campus, got an phone call a week later

I made contact with a recruiter to set up an interview and their initial response was quick. They wanted to set up an interview, however after I sent in my available times, it took them months to get back to me. Eventually after more emails were exchanged we were able to set something up. It ended up being a 1 hour technical phone interview, with 2 questions.

The interview was conducted via skype. It was brief and interesting. Interviewer was from Internet.org. He gave an introduction about himself and then asked about me. The interview was 45 minutes long. Interviewer was friendly but particular about time.

Initial HR phone interview, introducing yourself, small coding task.Second phone interview with a developer, generic discussion about things I do at the beginning following by a coding task about traversing a binary tree in some specific order.

Phone interview after referral. I got referred, responded to a few emails, and got interviewed over the phone. Interviewer couldn't speak much English, which is fine, but a problem when having a conversation that would be evaluated

At first, I submit my resume to hr, then I have a interview in 13.Dec. This is a phone interview. We talked about my resume and interest at first, than I did some code problems.

I contacted a recruiter via email that I received by a former Facebook employee. She followed up asking some standard questions about my experience and availability with a phone screening that lasted about 15 minutes. I then scheduled a phone interview with an engineer in the Instagram even though I was only applying for positions in Europe. The question was pretty difficult and it was more of a mathematical problem…  than a computer science questions. I studied a lot of algorithms and data structures exercises. The engineer helped me getting the idea on how to solve the problem but I was running out of time unfortunately.

I had one phone screening, which I did not pass, because I was unable to complete my coding within the given time frame. Overall the interview went clear, I was given hints, we talked about possible solutions, complexities and everything was friendly. That's why my overall impression is positive.Later, after the interview, I was able to solve it in a relaxed environment within 30 minutes. Which is still too long…  for phone screen. Conclusion: you need practice more, more and more..

Got in through a referral. Fairly standard interview questions, mostly leetcode and CTCI will suffice as practice. Interview bit is also helpful. It was my first interview so I had a hard time trying to talk as well as code at the same time.

Failed out first round although that was my fault. Interviewer barely spoke english, and they had an extremely bad connection (it was on the phone). The test was fair however and they gave me plenty of time, I just wasn't good enough. One weird thing was that they asked me to choose any language I wanted to do the interview question; I picked ruby and then the back off and…  say well, anything but that.

Spoke with the recruiter over the phone and was invited for a screening, which I chose to do onsite at a whiteboard. Recruiter gave a quick tour and then I spent about 45 minutes with a senior engineer doing some whiteboard coding, followed by talking about Facebook. Although I didn't move on to a full onsite, it was a positive experience and I enjoyed meeting with the interviewer.

There was a phone screen which lasted under 30 minutes followed by a day on the Seattle campus where there was an hour long interview, campus tour, and lunch. When I went there were 5 other people going through the process with me on the same day.

Contacted by university recruiter for a phone screen. They provided a helpful prep resource and the questions in the interview were straightforward. I was flown out to the Menlo Park campus for University day, where I had 4 interviews and then QA sessions and a campus tour. Most interviews were standard except one negative experience where I asked about the result of a test case and the interviewer kept changing…  his answer. It seems that even one poor interview will hurt your chances.

Telephone interview, very bad, the INDIAN interviewer is very tough and speaks very poor English, it's hard to get his idea when you first hear about it. Although I passed, I don't like it at all.

Asked me a few questions about my resume, then a typical coding question. My interviewer was helpful in pointing out bugs and providing clarification when requested. University day is great, candidates get a full tour of Facebook's Menlo Park campus.

It was a phone call with coderpad for coding. Just like how some people say college professors/lecturers who teach class shouldn't have heavy accents, THE SAME THING GOES FOR INTERVIEWERS. I had trouble understand him and it seemed like Facebook didn't give a damn about who they use as their interviewers and just pulled someone out of a hat. The interviewer was nice and knowledgeable about the question he was…  asking, but that was it. He also called in late, saying he had trouble finding a room that was free. That's super irresponsible, and I feel like Facebook does not dedicate time to improve the interviewing process. I'm glad they don't recruit at my university.

I had two technical interviews with Facebook. Both interviewers asked me a few behavioral questions first such as why facebook and then move into coding challenges. I gave two solutions to one problem during the first round and passed it. For the second one, I only managed to solve one quite hard problem and failed it unsurprisingly.

Interview process moved quickly - the interview was a few days after they contacted me. They held an interview social on the evening before, so we were able to meet our interviewers and ask questions in a more casual setting. The actual interview was spent briefly going over my resume, then most of the time was spent on the coding questions.

The process was fairly smooth - good information provided for preparing for the interview & proper expectations were set before the interview regarding they day's schedule. My experience with both recruiting and engineering was very good.

Emailed recruiter who's email I had from last year's internship interview. Probably due to large amount of applicants, they kept losing my information and taking a very long time to get back to me. Took around 3 weeks to schedule a first-round phone interview.After passing, I told them I had a deadline within a week - they were able to schedule an onsite that was 3 days later, and I…  received an offer 2 days after my onsite. Initial phone screen scheduling was frustrating, but they more than made up for it by getting back to me so quickly after the interview and working with my timeline.

I applied through employee referral. The process took 2 days. The HR was very nice and responsive. After one phone interview, I was invited to Menlo Park main campus for onsite interview. The interviews have three rounds, the final round of which is a 20 min behavioral questions and 20 min coding. All other interviews are purely technical.

On campus interview followed by an onsite interview. Great interviewers, very nice and helpful - answered all my questions about facebook's technology and the job's tasks. The interviews themselves weren't too hard, pretty standard DSA questions. The process was very quick as I had competing offers, but it was still pretty slow to set up the onsite interview after the on-campus round. I got delayed a week later than I…  wanted.

First had a behavioral phone screen and then a technical phone screen. The process was very organized and efficient, and the recruiters were all very friendly and professional. The technical interview as 45 minutes and was not a particularly difficult question. However, the interviewer was not very good at making it a collaborative process or helping out if I was ever stuck.

First, I was contacted by the recruiter after being referred by a Facebook employee. We had a brief conversation about my background and future plans, and then he gave me some preparation material and asked me to provide some dates for phone screenings.I set up the phone screen after 2 weeks, the interview was 1 hour with 2 coding problems. The turnaround time for phone round was quick, the recruiter…  then followed up with the onsite interview process.The onsite interview was total of 4 rounds of behavioral, system design, and coding problems. There was also a lunch with FB engineer during the onsite which doesn't count towards the interview feedback. Overall, the interview problems were of average difficulty and leetcode is a good resource for preparation.It took around two weeks to hear back from the recruiter for the final decision, which was positive. The offer was pretty generous which I accepted.

After I applied for Software Engineer Internship, there were two phone interview. Both were coding interview, but the second round is more difficult. The interviewers were professional and they also told me about their work. It is a good way to imagine the interview was solving some problems with the interviewers, that could help you perform better.

They were always really nice and helpfull. We had a really good chat. The questions were not super hard. When the questions became harder they still stayed really nice and helpfull. It was a really nice chat !

Phone screen followed by onsite. I need 30 words so I am going to keep writing. Everyone was very friendly. Super pleasant interview experience. I still need 30 words but hopefully I am close.

It was a phone coding interview using online coding software. The engineer who called me was very nice and it was a positive learning experience. The coding questions seem simple at first, but make sure you know how to write an optimal solution, and that you can think on your feet regarding improving your solutions to the problems.

I was head hunted and after a phone screen, I went to Menlo Park to attend the onsite interview. The interview went really well and I gave the optimal solutions possible. I was optimistic to get an offer. After two weeks I got a mail that because of high volume of applicants they are not going to extend an offer.This literally made no sense. I even took pics of all…  my answers and when I came back and verified all my answers. The recruiter didn't even have the courtesy to mail answers to my questions. Please save yourself time and energy and not apply here.

It all started with a mail, I applied online but they noticed me through the recommendation of someone that already works at Facebook.A week before the online interview the recruiter called me through Skype and explained the process.The interview was held through Skype (No cam) and I coded using codepad.io.

I applied through career fair, and received email within a week. scheduled a tech phone interview the next week. It was a 45 min interview. the interviewer was nice, but I was not in good condition (just taken a nap, and my brain was not functioning well). we went straight to the problem. The problem is some dynamic programming stuff, I was afraid that I can't come up with the…  right solution so I just started writing stupid recursion solution to save some time. and then we spent some time fixing it. And I came up with the "right" solution at the end, but I don't have time to write it, so I just explained how it should work. and then I asked a few questions, and that is it. I got rejection email in only 15 minutes later.

The recruiter first asked me about the project. That took about 5 or 7 minutes. Then he asked to solve one coding problem. I successfully described the most efficient solution. However, it took me way too long, so I ran out of time before getting even halfway though the implementation.

Got the interview from LinkedIn recruiter contact. Got a very coding question during the phone interview. I was able to get the solution but not able to get the optimal solution.

Applied through University Career Center. An On-campus interview was set up with the Career Center. It was difficult to communicate with an Indian Interviewer, and I ran out of time when I was implementing pseudo code into Python code.

I was referred by my friend. I interviewed at Facebook in Oct 2016. The question is not difficult but I did not give an optimal answer in the first place. Rather starting to code right after the question was given, I spent some time to explain how would my idea work and simulate the process. I thought more communication would be more important than just coding, but it turnt out…  not. I would suggest no or little communication with a coding show for the interview.

The speed at which the interviewing timeline happens is very welcome. Most companies take weeks to get feedback and then relay that decision to you. Facebook did this in a matter of days. This is definitely an advantage so they can snag top candidates before they commit to other companies. Overall, the process took 3 weeks from receiving an email about an on campus (university) interview to the final decision…  after an on-site interview.I applied through the career fair at my university and received an on-campus interview the following week. I passed the on-campus interview and then went on-site in Seattle about a week later. During the on-site interview, I felt I choked and got too nervous. Overall, the questions were challenging, but nothing that was extremely difficult.During the on-campus interview, it was structured that I was asked about my background for around 5-8 minutes, and then had a technical question, and then got to ask the interviewer any questions I had. However, during the on-site interview, the interviewer told me about himself, and then immediately told me we were going to try to get through 2 technical questions. We then started the questions and got through about 1.5 of them. It should have been possible to get through both if I was less nervous.The biggest con to the overall process was the lack of interaction with my interviewer on the on-site interview. I felt he didn't get an accurate sense of my ability as an overall programmer and peer since there was no chance to introduce myself. Due to this, I didn't get a chance to converse even a little bit before doing the technical questions, which I think might have helped with relaxing a little bit.Overall a good experience, but I wish there was a chance to be a little bit more personable with my on-site interviewer.

I had a technical phone interview where I shared a little about myself with the interviewer from California. Then we did one interview question, which I coded on an online notepad and talked it over on the phone. Then I asked 2 questions and awaited for the result. It was a good experience even though I did not get an offer.

It's a 45 minutes phone interview by a software engineer. He asked two questions about general coding. The questions are not too difficult, but there are some corner cases that are hard to be completely correct for the first time. The time is also a little bit tight.

on-campus interview. I wanted to schedule a phone interview, recruiter said they have on-campus interviews in 2 weeks, so I went to the on-campus interview. They move pretty fast in terms of scheduling and giving out results, within 3 business days.

The process started when one of the recruiters reached out to me on LinkedIn. Pretty much asked me a few basic questions which took the place of the screening process and a couple days later I was contacted to set up a round of interviews over the phone. The phone interview was quite easy actually and the interviewer was super nice and helpful.Two days later I was contacted again to…  set up onsite interviews. A couple days before the interview, one of their recruiters called me and told me absolutely everything I needed to know for the onsite interviews and what to expect. Right then it was evident that he really did care how well I did and I wasn't just another candidate.The onsite interviews consisted on just a single 45 minute long technical interview along with a free lunch, tours around their Seattle offices, and a few presentations by some of their engineers.Just a week later I got the call that I got an offer! Overall, Facebook was by far the best company I have ever interviewed with. They really try and take care of you and sell you the company, instead of just shuffling you through interviews. Because of my interview experience alone I decided to take the offer.

I got contacted by a recruiter after attending a conference, but did not take further steps until GHC. At GHC, I met a Facebook engineer and showed interest in one of their products and got a 45 minute interview on the same day. After a few days, I received an invitation to join their on-site interview. It consists of three 45 minute interviews. I was asked two coding questions in…  the first one, a behavioral and an easy coding question in the second, and a coding question in the last. The questions were basic Leetcode ones.

The recruiter was nice and all the interviewers are friendly. I solved all the questions but still fail the interview, I think they really need totally bug free!!!! It is said interviewer will run the code from white board!

Referred by one friend, and response in 3 days. First round is phone interview with online code judge process, second round is on site for 4 rounds interview. The HR are so nice and the phone there are mostly busy with their work, they do not seem to have lots of time for the interview. The quicker you finish, the more question you answer, would be the way that they…  prefer. One of the interviewer asked me a lot things related with my previous project, but I do not think it is related.

Got referred through a friend, one phone screen then onsite, they had everyone do 4 interviews then toured us around and then we left the Facebook campus. They gave us t-shirts and fed us lunch too.

Conference, I met with one of the engineers at the booth and got into a heated discussion about the applications of virtual reality into social media. Gave me a fast-track ticket to schedule an interview in 2 hours. Interviewed, performed mediocrely, then got an offer to do an interview again tomorrow at the exact same place.

I'm a CS new Grad. The interviewer asked about my experiences and projects and a programing question. Tell me which project you are most proud of. Why you want to work in Facebook?

I had a one on one interview on campus in West Lafayette. He asked about my projects for a bit and then jumped straight to coding questions. He asked me two questions. One of them was dp which I didn't get completely right.

I had three technical interviews - one after another, 45 minutes each. One interview focused on career/behavorial questions: asked about my prior projects, difficult technical challenge I overcame, my weaknesses, etc. A coding question was asked as well. My second and third interviews were similar: primarily a coding question(s).

Recruited at university career fair, started with an event with pizza to meet the interviewers. Then I had an on-campus interview with an engineer for a 1-hr coding problem on a whiteboard. The interviewer was not very responsive and not enthusiastic, so I didn't feel that I could do my best during the interviewer. Don't expect to get any hints when you start pursuing a wrong approach, and make sure…  you think about the best runtime solution instead of pursuing a brute-force solution first - they seem to really care about that.

I was contacted by a recruiter to sign up for an interview after applying online about three weeks ago, and set up a time about two weeks later. The first interview consisted of 2 programming questions. I was then was invited that night to do a second interview. The second interview also consisted of 2 programming questions. I received the offer the next day.

I was contacted after a career fair. It was a live coding interview and was asked to use coderpad. The interviewer called me via phone and gave me a problem which I had to code before him. Got an email after a week that I was rejected. The question was on encoding and involved recursion.

Applied on the Facebook career website. Received an email response about a month later, and a phone interview was set up about a week later. Brief introductory questions about experience/fit followed by a coding question. Coding question was done online using a coding interview tool.

1 Phone Interview + OnsiteThe onsite interview consisted of 3 1 on 1 interviews, 2 technical and 1 behavioral + technical. Be sure to have an answer for "Why Facebook" that definitely tripped me up.

oc interview i didn't take long before they reached out to me after the career fair on campus. the interview question is very hard compared to other interviews I have done before.

I applied from my college's job fair and I was emailed for an interview. I replied to the email with the basic information and the time I was available. I gave the interview but the lady who was taking it had a very dull tone and felt like she didn't wanna take the interview.I was denied after the phone interview.

applied at campus career fair; had a phone interview but i didn't think I did well but I was invited to an onsite interview. the interviewer was very nice and basically answered two questions. About a week and half later, the recruiter called and said I was not not offered an internship. both interviews were mostly coding

Went to Menlo Park on their university day (super day), received only one 45-minute technical interview. The event took your entire day. There were about 40 undergrads coming from different colleges. They were all for the internship position. I solved the problem really quickly. But I cannot optimize my code as the interview expected. That was probably the reason I got rejected.

I was contacted by a recruiter for this role. She was very kind and accommodative. She was flexible enough with me availability.However, my luck wasn't so good with the interviewer that was picked for me.3 minutes into the phone call I realized that it is going to be extremely challenging for hold the attention of the interviewer. The engineer who interviewed me seemed very disinterested in the process. He probably…  called me from home while making his breakfast. I could hear vessels banging and he was talking to someone while I was trying to arrive at a solution. He carelessly responded to my followup questions and cut me off at 40minutes mark in a 45min interview.I did arrive at the solution and code was 95% done before he cut me off. I spoke about different algorithms and issues with them. But he didn't seem to be listening to whatever I said. It seems like all he wanted to solution and not how I approached at the solution (so all that you hear about FB interview of being tested on how you arrive at the solution may not be true always.)My request to FB recruiters (if they come across this post) please consider who volunteerr (or gets picked up) for interviewing. If a person is not interested, kindly don't force that person. It ends up wasting everyone's time.

Applied online and heard back a few months later for a phone screening. I was asked the Wildcard problem. Be sure to clarify the question. I had trouble understanding my interviewer and the didn't fully understand the question until I only had ten minutes left.

The whole process went by incredibly quickly. After applying directly to a recruiter, I completed a coding challenge through HackerRank as part of the screening process. I then received a call from the recruiter to walk me through the interview steps, which was a very kind gesture to make towards an intern.After that, there were two phone interviews, each just a week apart. Both went rather smoothly, but I was…  rejected by email just hours after the second interview. While no feedback was provided, and although I thought the technical portion of the interviews went well, I have a hunch that they were looking for someone with more university and extracurricular project experience, something which I lacked.

The interview process was good and smooth. I had 2 phone interviews. The Facebook office is really mind blowing. My interviewers were really nice. 5 onsite interviews - 2 system design and 2 coding and 1 behavioral interview with a small programming question. I think my system design was not as good as the coding ones but despite that I think because of my overall performance I got the offer.

the first phone interview with facebook, and the indian brother first ask me to do a background introduction. So I start with introducing me background and projects I've done. after 3 mins, he stop me and said, let's coding. so we were using collabedit to code, it spend a bit of time to set it up (set it up earlier and prepare it, practice coding on it). the whole process…  is good, he give me hint when I got stuck

I applied through employee referral. It took about two weeks and I got a phone interview invitaion.The phone interview lasted about 45 minutes. The phone line was poor, I could barely hear what the interviewer said. I was asked to code online. No self introduction, the question is Print the tree by column

Got contacted by recruiter. Had an on campus interview and was asked a couple behavioral questions and dived straight into coding question. Interviewer was very friendly and overall made it a less intimidating experience.

A phone interview then an onsite interview. Then phone interview begins with a behavior question "tell me about project experience you have" then followed up by 2 data structure & algorithms questions

Applied via Campus Career Fair, got a call after a week for on campus 1:1 interview. Got the reply in couple of days for onsite interview in Melno Park. Will be going for onsite soon, where there will be 4 interviews on the same day.

First had a 45 minute interview on my school's campus, then another 45 minute interview on site. For both it was one on one with a company employee. Both were very nice and professional. Involved general algorithm questions and asking about interests, etc. Both interviews involved coding on a white board.

I applied online. After a phone screen, I went to Menlo Park on their university day, received three 45-minute technical interviews and one behaviroal interview. Interviewers were so friendly and cheerful. I faced seven coding questions in four interviews. Overall the experience is great.

- Applied through referral- One phone interview- Onsite interviewsInterview process was very smooth. And recruiter was really nice! Some interviewers looked tired, but some of them were nice. Their hiring process was really smooth.

The phone interview was pretty fast and the experience was good.The onsite was kinda ok, easy questions.Then comes the interesting part, I waited 9 business DAYS after my onsite was finished. I took him 7 days to collect feedbacks. I have few competing offers deadline approaching, which really annoyed me. I sent one email to my hr per day, and then she just stopped replying to me for few days.Anyway,…  the interview process was extremely slow in my case.

Had a phone interview that lasted about 45 mins. Basically just coding problems not much behavioral questions. The interviewer was very helpful. They usually ask 1-2 questions. I thought I did fine but I think there were just better candidates. I never got to the 2nd problem though.

Recruiter contacted me. It was followed by a phone screen where I was asked to solve a problem on coderpad.I was brought onsite to the Menlo Park office where I had to go through 4 rounds of interview - one career discussion+coding, two completely coding and one system design.The office seemed pretty dead and so did the people. During the design round, the interviewer never gave me any feedback and…  was busy typing on his phone the entire time. The lunch interviewer found it hard to smile it seemed. Overall, the place gave a pretty negative vibe to me.

The recruiter contacted me and asked if i'd be interested in interviewing for the position. I went through a phone screening where i coded on a shared editor, i breezed through the interview and got the solutions, then optimized them as needed. The interviewer seemed happy with my solution however i got a no go call the next day, pretty confused as to what went wrong and they refused to…  disclose due to their privacy policy :(

Applied online. First I had a phone screening, after that I had a phone interview where I was asked to solve a programming problem. It was rather straightforward, I solved it with a BFS. The interviewer then asked a couple of questions based on the solution such as running time and how could that be improved. I got called for an onsite interview. They give you total freedom in choosing…  your interviews date and time. The on site interview took all day long. I had 5 different interviewers asking coding questions, design questions and behavioral questions. The questions were hard but I did not feel nervous at all, all of the interviewers were nice and friendly people.

Chatted with an recruiter, who then directed me to the recruiter for Facebook Seattle. She had a list of multiple choice android questions as a really quick initial screen. After that had a skype interview with an engineer there. Mostly coding questions worked through in an online shared textpad environment. After that had a day with 4 onsite interviews. One was around system design, one was on career so far/career…  goals, and two more coding interviews.

I was contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn. We scheduled a phone interview. The phone interviewer asked me about my background and then a coding question. He let me know that I did well at the end of interview. The next day, I got a call from recruiter and told me that they would like me to come onsite. I was also forwarded to another recruiter. Both the recruiters had…  been helpful along the way. I had two coding rounds, two design rounds and one behavioral round onsite. I may have made couple of mistakes in behavioral round, and some mistakes in other rounds. I was not very confident of getting through, but thought there could be a slim chance. I did not hear back from the recruiter for seven days, so I followed up. The recruiter mentioned she will get back to me as soon as she has an update. Three days later, I received a reject email.Overall, I liked the interview process and everyone was great. I would have appreciated a call, just as a courtesy. The lack of courtesy seemed to me that the recruiter did not seem as much enthusiastic after on-site compared to before the on-site interview. It is understandable though, but she was thoroughly professional whenever I worked with her.One more thing, if Facebook has so high a rejection rate, it is better to have phone screen + a video call screen, before bringing people in. It will save them some money, and save time from my side.

I was initially contacted by a recruiter and we had an initial discussion about engineering at Facebook and my interests. I was then scheduled for a phone interview.The phone interview was with an Engineer and he asked 2 pretty standard coding questions, nothing crazy. After the phone interview, I was invited onsite.The onsite interview consisted of 5 sessions:* A discussion with the interviewer about my past experience and how I…  reacted to certain situations ("tell me about a time when" type questions) and a coding question* 3 coding sessions* A system design sessionI also had lunch with an Engineer and was able to ask additional questions during lunch. Overall, the sessions were well managed. 2 of the coding sessions involved standard coding questions that can be found on various online resources (leetcode, geeks for geeks, etc). The third was a question that I hadn't seen before and that I found challenging. I ran out of time on this particular session.The system design question was relatively straightforward.The discussion + coding session threw me for a loop. I had a discussion with the interviewer for most of the session about various situations in the past. Suddenly, he said "ok, we have less than ten minutes left, time to code". It was a little jarring and I had a little bit of a tough time switching gears so suddenly. The question itself wasn't too difficult, but the sudden change caught me off guard and I had some mistakes in my solution.Overall the interviewers were very nice and respectful. When I had the opportunity to ask questions, it felt like they were hones and sincere in their answers (it didn't feel like unnecessary corporate cheerleading).After my onsite had concluded, I received an email for feedback on the interview, which was nice. They asked for detailed feedback on the interview and whether or not the folks were on time for the sessions. It seems like Facebook takes their interview process and the feedback seriously (from what I can gather).In the end, I was not extended an offer, but the overall process was very efficient and smooth.

First call with recruiter went well and after a few days they told me that I am being invited for an onsite interview with a single interviewer (instead of the phone screen). That interview went well and I was selected for the 2nd "pirate interview". They gave me enough material about what those interviews will be like and how to prepare for them. Everything good so far. I go for…  the 2nd interviews and I thought I did really well in the interviews. The only gotcha was that I had a lunch with an "interviewer" and that lunch took too long and it shortened the time I had available for my next coding interview. Unfortunately that lack of time resulted in me doing not so well in the coding interview (i.e. not being able to come up with a good working and efficient program) and apparently that resulted into it being a "no go" for me. :-(

The interview started with a round of phone calls covering standard coding exercises and select domain-specific questions. After that we proceeded to the on-site interview. It was a long day full of many great talks and problems. I saw a large part of the campus and got to see people in their work environment. Overall, it was a great experience.

Was contacted by interviewer on LinkedIn. Since I live in Seattle, I was called onsite for 45 min preliminary round. HR received me and gave office tour. Then, I was introduced to interviewer. Interviewer was young and energetic . Interviewer asked me a question around binary tree and I was able to answer the question and write code quickly. Next day I was contacted by recruiter saying that they want…  to scheduled another interview before calling me onsite. This time I asked for phone interview. Second interviewer asked another question related to trees. I was able solve the problem and write code in 40 min. Later HR contacted me and said Interviewers are not happy with me. I'm not sure what they were expecting. HR said they couldn't tell me the reason for rejection due to legal reasons. It seems like they just want young engineers who can just code.

This was a phone Interview. Was asked about a challenging issue that I had worked on. Was asked various other questions about projects on resume. Followed by a simple graph question

The recruiter reached out from linkedin. Then I was scheduled for a phone interview.One week after the phone interview, I went on-site for 5 more 45 minutes one-on-one interviews. The first one dedicated 25 minutes on behavioral questions. i.e. challenge, conflict, etc. Including the first one, three interviews had white board coding algorithm questions. The other 2 interviews were on system design. The algorithm questions could be found on leetcode…  and careercup. The system design focused on distributed system.Practice was the key. Though, I had about 3 weeks to prepare for the interviews, as a father of 2 toddlers, I could only have a couple of hours here and there. It's pretty hard to study when another pair of little hands are also banging the keyboards at the same time. With limited time, I focused more on the algorithm questions and did well on the coding rounds.However, a week after the on-site, HR informed me the decision to reject my application due to the poor performance on the design round. I didn't think I did badly on the design round, but with a large candidate pool, I guess they could be very selective on hiring. It's really a devastating feeling to see your faith controlled by some 20-yo. Still, I feel with more practice on the system design questions, it's not impossible to get there.

My conversation with Facebook started when recruiter send me an email, we scheduled a call where she asked about my interests and background. Surprisingly recruiter asked me a technical question, it was not hard (Fibonacci function and its optimizations), but it was unexpected. Anyway I answered her question in details (bottom up solution, top down, DP) and she replied that it's exactly what she expected to hear.Since I'm local to…  Bay Area I had an opportunity to have 1:1 onsite screen instead of phone screen. I choose that option and we arranged the interview in a week. Onsite screen was good, the interviewer was very nice and friendly, he was very helpful during the interview and there was an impression that we wanted to see my process of thinking. Eventually I solved the problem that was average difficulty. I started with brute force and then optimized it. In 2 days I got a call from the recruiter, she told I did well and we scheduled onsite interview.There were 5 interview for onsite: whiteboard programming -> whiteboard programming -> resume discussion with coding -> architecture discussion -> whiteboard programming. The problems were average difficulty. I was kind of slow on the first and last coding, I think it was expected to solve a couple of problems instead of one. All interviewers were very friendly and helpful, at the end all of them shared that I solved the problem correctly and in an efficient way and that it was OK that we solved only one problem.I already wanted to say that regardless the result my experience was positive, but after the interview I got a pretty bad experience. I didn't have any response or feedback for 2 weeks after the interview. I expected the rejection, but the silence in the first week gave me some hope that they are thinking about me (I was slow on the interview, but I didn't fail it completely). After the first week of silence I tried to contact me recruiter and eventually I figured out that she left Facebook and didn't move my case to anyone. I tried to contact Facebook careers page on Facebook, but it was helpless, they didn't reply to me. So, I found coordinators email (who scheduled my interview) and she finally shared the decision with me.

It was a typical Facebook interview with 2 phone screen rounds and then the onsite interviews. The phone interviews were both algorithm problems. The onsite rounds consisted of 2 coding, 1 system design and 2 behavioral+coding rounds. Lunch was included with an engineer and also a round with an engineering manager where I got the chance to ask as many questions about Facebook as I wanted without being evaluated.Questions in…  the coding round were not difficult (if you prepare well) and I was able to come up with the most efficient algorithm very quickly (later verified on the web) but - and here's the most important point - do not mess up the coding. You are expected to write perfect code, clean and bug-free. If you don't then you get axed. I didn't, so...What was disappointing is the fact that even though they say reaching the optimal solution is the most important thing and what they are evaluating is your thought process, they don't mean it. They want coders not engineers. Perfection is needed even if they tell you that it's not expected.Overall though I had a positive experience. All the people involved were very nice and smart. They did not make me feel unwelcome. I guess that's why people love working there.

I got two phone interviews, one is all about behavior question/ background check and the other is technical interview. After that, I got onsite interview with Facebook in Menlo Park. Three interviews in one day.

My process was very long but this was mainly due to my timeline rather than theirs.I was referred to a recruiter by a colleague.Then had a phone screen with the recruiter.Then a phone/white board coding interview/test with an interviewer.Was then invited to Menlo Park for an onsite interview, which consisted of 4 1hr interviews which mainly focused on coding ability.

The interview process consisted of an initial phone screen followed by 3 onsite interviews. 2 of the onsite interviews were technical while the 3rd was informational. A smooth process overall.

I submitted my resume through school job fair. The process took 4 weeks and got the phone interview. The first round phone interview is around 45 minutes. Went through my background and previous internship and project experience. Asked about most interesting project and previous team work experience. Got three algorithm questions.

Asked a friend to refer me to Facebook. Received the email after several days. Phone interview in April and the onsite interview in May. I did not know enough about the onsite interview and after the interview I found I was slow in answering all the questions which might be negative. At least I should have shown my efficiency.

They called me for a 45 minute technical phone interview and asked me data structures questions. It wasn't too bad and before the technical stuff I just spent a few minutes talking about my resume projects.

I had one phone interview + 4 on-site interviews: 2 coding, 1 cultural + coding, 1 system design.My experience suggests that I should have not waste my time with Facebook. It seems that they just interview with people without giving them offer. I had a perfect day at my on-site interview. I heard a few others were like me as well. None of us got an offer. In my case,…  two of the interviewers were really surprised with my answers and I finished 15 minutes before the time goes up and we chat the rest of the time. One of the interviewers told me that she believes Facebook should hire less people to have enough challenges for the current employees. Recruiters at Facebook are also terrible. They respond to your emails with template answers and unfortunately have very low technical knowledge.

Internal recruiter called me. Asked her how she got my name-- She found me on LinkedIn. Asked if I was open to relocation. Sent an email about what the interview would include. Got a call from an interviewer who was super nice and understanding for a code interview.

Had a phone call from recruiter, from my linked in profile. Recruiters were polite. Had a 1st round onsite interview, then got invited for the 2nd round.The questions will be of easy to average difficulty if some time is spent in brushing up the basic algorithms (from arrays to graphs). There in lies the problem, i,e. questions are not challenging. I answered all questions, with efficient solutions. There was no…  indication what so ever from the interviewer if there was anything wrong in my solutions. However, I'm guessing that since I couldn't finish in time to run through couple of examples, I got rejected. They don't give any grace period, if there's no time left, they end it abruptly. I guess they want to be fair to everyone. There was absolutely no feedback from any of the interviewers during the process, so it's hard understand what are they looking for, if anything is going wrong. This is true for the system-design as well.In my case looks like the decision was already made before lunch, the last round interviewers seemed completely un-interested. One of them was on the laptop typing continuously while I was presenting my solution.I'm sure they are able to find people who are able to code the solution in time. In my opinion, for most, this is only possible if you have already coded same or similar problem. There are tons of websites that lists the questions. Just spend enough time to practice them in coding.The interviews are less about problem solving ability, it's more about finishing the code in time. This process has worked from them and they will continue to follow it. Keep practicing writing the code, if you are lucky you'll get one of the questions that you are already familiar with.There was no feedback from the recruiter except I didn't get through.

Don't waste your time with Facebook unless you're desperate. Like the other people mentioned here, there is something fishy going on with Facebook interviews. I really did well with the onsite interview and they told me that they passed on my application with no feedback after 2 weeks.I've gone through two phone interviews and then an onsite interview with 3 coding (ninja), 1 design (pirate) and 1 cultural/coding (jedi) interview.…  I have heard that they usually do only 2 ninja interviews, but I got 3 for some reason.The coding interviews are pretty standard. You either got it right or not. Explain everything clearly as you code it, because they may not understand your solution even if it's an optimal solution. Be prepared for follow up questions after that. Since I got the coding questions right, I got asked a second one each time. So on a successful interview be prepared to do 7 coding questions (again 5 in most cases).

Typical Facebook interview: 1 conversation/coding interview, 2 coding interviews, 1 architecture/design interview. The questions were very typical algorithmic questions that you might see for a software role. Sadly, I had seen a few of the problems before. The interviewers were really friendly and collaborative. The office was really nice and definitely is worth the visit.

Find someone referred me. Then recruiter reach me out and asked me to provide some available time to take a phone interview. And then received a confirmation email, and the link of online editor. During the phone interview, interviewer will talk with you on the phone and type the questions in the online editor. And you are also asked to write your code in the editor.

Technical interview conducted over phone and coderpad.ioThey didn't require the code written to compile, instead they just wanted me to convince them that my solution worked.The entire process took about an hour: 15 minutes discussing resume, 30 minutes for the question, and 15 minutes for any questions you may have for the recruiter.

Awful overall process. Had a phone interview and then on-site. On site interview was too generic. Facebook followed up with asking for references, then academic transcript which took two weeks. Then Facebook asked me to solve a coding puzzle and after one month, said no. The overall process was unorganized and length and even if I had gotten a job offer, I don't think it was pleasant in any way.…  In contrast, Google's interview process was much smoother and they replied within a week of on-site. Facebook should learn a thing or two from Google.

Started with two phone screens before an on-site interview. On-site interview was 4 rounds on 1:1 or 2:1 (in the case there was a shadowing interviewer) and includes lunch. On-site interview travel arrangements and reimbursements were handled by a contracted travel agency acting on behalf of Facebook. All my interviewers were very nice and professional. You will be hard pressed to find engineers with big egos here. The recruiters I…  worked with, on the other hand, mostly seemed like they had their act together.I thought my interviews went well – each of my on-site interviewers complimented me on my solutions, so I was surprised when my recruiter emailed me that I did not get an offer.Something fishy is definitely going on at Facebook. I am under the impression that their HR department is not completely honest with their candidates. If you sort the interviews by date on Glassdoor, you will notice that no one recently has been getting offers. I've been told by friends (inside and outside the company) that they thought Facebook wasn't even hiring anymore until the Fall... So I was definitely surprised when I was approached with the opportunity to interview with Facebook. I am at a loss of words after receiving my rejection despite the positive feedback my interviewers provided me. This experience has definitely deterred me from considering Facebook for future employment as it feels like I was brought through the process just so HR could justify their recruiting budget despite there being no job.

Interview process took 3 weeks. Had phone interview. After bit of background started with coding. I got some clues and solved it. But they rejected. They just want coders and to jump into correct code right away.

It takes about one month. Referred by a friend, passed the phone interview after two weeks of the referral. I went to an onsite later. The process was pretty standard and most interviewers were respectful and friendly.

I attended Facebook's University Day, where they had about 20 university students who were there for interviews. The day starts off with the interview itself, then you spend about 5 hours touring the Facebook campus and learning more about Facebook. When the interview process began, all of us were siting in a room and interviewers would come in and call our names. I watched as interviewer after interviewer came in…  with cheerful looks on their faces and called out names of other students. After about 5 minutes, my interviewer came in and called me. He was a heavy set man, dressed sloppy, and had a look on his face like he didn't want to be there. I could tell right away that it would not go well. When we entered the interview room, he immediately began asking technical questions. He didn't ask any questions about me to get to know me, and after asking other students that were there, they all began with a talk about their backgrounds. During the entire interview, I had the impression that my interviewer just wanted to rush me through so he could go on to do something else. He asked me 2 questions, one which went well and a second where I had a bit of trouble. My recruiter had told me beforehand that if we got stuck on a question, our interviewer would make an effort to get us back on track by offering hints. My interviewer did no such thing. I even told him what I was trying to do, and why I was getting stuck, implying that I could use a hint. He just sat there without saying anything. Finally after I wasted about 10 minutes trying different ways to solve it, he tells me that we're running out of time and hurries me through the rest of the problem. He gave me the last 5 minutes to ask him questions. Since I had a feeling that he was being forced to be there, one of my questions was if Facebook employees have dedicated interviewers, or if random employees are selected to be interviewers from time to time. He said it was the latter. So of course I knew that he was being forced to be there and he just wanted it to end. After the interview was over, he walked me back to meet the other students. By this time I already knew he wasn't going to give me a good review, but Facebook doesn't all you to go home at this point. You're forced to spend 5 hours learning about how wonderful it is to work at Facebook so that you know about all the good things you just missed out on. A week later I received my rejection email.

HR first appointment the interview by email. The interviewer first introduce herself. Then ask some question about the resume. Then process the technical question for about 30 minutes. And ask if I have some question. More than one week, the HR give the result.

Submitted by resume online. Got email back in a few weeks followed by 2 Round of phone screen. Prepared all I could on leetcode and hackerrank. Interviewer first asked about my passion and followed by 2 technical questions. Questions were not that hard but I wasn't entirely ready.

First, ask some questions about Facebook, do you use Facebook? Why you like it? Which part of it should be improved? and the begin to the coding part. It is a question about CVS encoding and decoding. It took me several minutes to understand the question, and I am too nervous to come up with a perfect solution. it is my first interview and I think I should learn more.

Initial phone screen from Human Resources. He followed up after an application 5 years ago or so. He did a quick phone screen and forwarded an overwhelming number of resources to help with the interview process. This included live meetings with Gayle Laakmann McDowell with help on technical interviews. I've never been more prepared by a recruiter and probably never will be again. Ironically, this is one of the cases…  where I needed it the least. It really just wasn't as technically challenging as interviews at Google or Microsoft.He then followed up and was super flexible on the phone screen which I opted to do in person. It's on the candidates schedule and terms. Very accommodating. During the in-person initial screen, the recruiter again offered tons of preparation and "pep talk." He did say not to rush and to take my time, which is definitely a tendency of mine. Don't listen to that advice, though. My adherence to this advice was ultimately cited as the reason for my rejection (my slow deliberation was interpreted as "struggling"). But otherwise, it was extremely helpful and really great.The interviewer I was scheduled with was out sick so I got another guy. It was the least adversarial interview of the Google/MS/Amazon style I've ever done. He was helpful and supportive. Very laid back (he was wearing sweat pants and a T-shirt) which really helped.I really took my time and avoided going into rush-panic like I do, and was only able to get through one question in the allotted time. I answered it and came up with the solution on my first try (very long and deliberate first try), which even my interviewer said he couldn't do during his interview. But at the end of the day, I was rejected anyway.It showed that it's important not to obsess over the technical preparation. The guy who interviewed me probably was less prepared technically when he interviewed, but he probably did a better job on the soft skills. And he got the job. I worked through on the technical front with no issue, but probably spoke without a sense of confidence and made bad jokes while slowly deliberating through the problem.

Recruiter reached out on LinkedIn, wanting to set up time to chat. Responded with a few suggestions and then heard nothing & had emails bounce back. Finally about a month later she responds and we connect. I'm in Seattle and after we talk, we schedule a single interview on site in Seattle. Initial confirmation was for an interview in Menlo Park, so had to have another go around with the…  recruiters. Got it scheduled for Seattle and I came in, interview went well. I heard back later that week about going to an on-site loop. I had to reach out to get the confirmation of on-site loop. On-site was pleasant and the interviewers asked some good questions. After the loop, it took them a couple of weeks to get back to me with a no decision. I don't mind the no decision from the loop, but this whole process shouldn't take three months and recruiter juggling. Doesn't seem too organised behind the scenes for recruiting. After the whole process I left feeling disrespected.

I applied for the position and quickly received a response that they were interested (about 1 day). They informed me that there was first a technical interview, then if I passed that, they would schedule a second culture/fit interview.Facebook provides access to a sponsored interview prep session by Gayle McDowell (author of "Cracking the Coding Interview") which were provided on a twice-a-week basis indefinitely, in in-person and online form.From this…  point on it was clear that they are very interested in churning through interview candidates at a rapid pace. I scheduled an interview a week after their contact, and ran prep (LeetCode.com offers a lot of questions in the style of their whiteboard tech interview) as much as I could.There were three other candidates in the lobby at the same time as me. I can only assume that there are as many as a couple dozen interviews done daily at this rate (they were scheduled 15 minutes before me).The technical interview is scheduled for a pretty tight (not hard, but they will stop you) 45 minutes. You'll get asked some sort of non-linear algorithmic question, and you MUST FOLLOW THE INTERVIEW PREP INSTRUCTIONS PRECISELY. One of the options for blueprinting out your solution is to maybe toss some pseudocode up explaining your algorithm - I did it a little while trying to explain and got dinged for "jumped to coding right away."As far as I can tell, they go through enough candidates that they can be extremely picky with their technical selection - ace it, you're golden. One misstep and you're chopped liver.

Referral, two phone screens, first one was memoization problem so use a hash set to remember prior values (this is a pretty practical question because you do use this in developing software), second was quick sort, then in-place quick sort (not as practical)

Was a 45 minute interview. Interviewer was very friendly and had interesting stories to tell. He was able to answer all the questions I asked him, I wish it was the same the other way around.

Contacted by a recruiter and an online screening of an algo problem. The whole process was very positive and everyone was very professional.The technical questions were easy and the interviewer extremely helpful.On the first call they tell you about the company in general and some of the benefits, they also explain the whole process of the interview (generally 3 steps).Then the technical interview is on a shared text editor.

Phone interview after 2 weeks of applying. Interview started with discussion of projects based on resume and then 2 questions asked on LinkedList and Trees. LinkedList question was average but question on tree took quiet a time.

Two rounds, each consisted of two programming exercises and respective follow up. Both interviewers asked about my most recent job experience. They were both very nice and introduced their team, and both interviews ended up to be around 45 minutes.

Employee referral, got a 45 min phone interview scheduled right away. I chose to go to the site and give the interview. Interviewer jumped right onto the question and helped me solve when I got stuck. I should have been more thorough with concepts.

I only got one phone interview. It was easy and positive. First, the interviewer asked me about the challenge I had before and how did I solve. And then two coding tests. One is about counting the 0s in an integer array and the other one is level traversal about BST.

Applied through career fair in my campus, on campus interview, then 4 rounds onsite interview at Facebook HQ in Menlo Park. The campus was very nice, looks like disneyland, and got chance to try Oculus rift and their free ice cream.

Basic Leetcode questions. The interviewers were really nice. Could answer all the questions in the interview but still got a reject after the final(2nd) interview. The people i talked to were really interesting.

1. Phone interview, technical. An engineer will call you. First is some typical HR questions related to resume, then is a coding question. At last you can ask some question to him.2. University Day, onsite. The same process as phone interview, but you will need to solve the coding problem by writing the solution code on the board.

1. Referral2. Got contacted by recruiter, scheduled a technical phone screen3. The technical phone screen, two coding questions4. Onsite interview invitation5. Onsite interview, one 1:1 technical interview, didn't quite figure out the coding problem, then lunch and campus tour6. Two week later no response. I had to ask the recruiter and referer for the no offer response

Phone interview. Chatted for a bit about my past, did a single programming challenge in my choice of language, chatted a bit afterward about Facebook.Overall, the interviewer was pleasant and helpful.

First recruiter phone screen, then 45 minutes on-site technical interview followed by a 4 rounds technical interview loop.Interview process is good however it appears the interviewers are more focused on coding fast and coding without bugs. It is a test for memorization skills instead of actual algorithms knowledge and the candidate's ability to solve a real engineering problem. They are looking for canned solution, any out-of-box idea would get rejected.I'd…  say the facebook hiring criteria would prefer younger coders who are just out of college and who had been exercised simple algorithms codings for a year or so. Leetcode.com is its bible. Experienced engineer may not be favored if you don't have time to sweep the coding exercises.

Had a phone interview followed by on site. Phone interview was good and the interviewer was very friendly. During onsite, I had about 5 one one one interviews. My interviews started on a bad note - the recruiter was late to pick me up from the lobby and my first interviewer came 10 minutes late. He then rushed me into a system design question. I outlined the initial design and…  checked with him if there were any specific directions he wanted to go into but got no response. I then kept working on the design question without him giving me any feedback. When there were only 5 minutes left, he started asking some questions on how some scenarios would work. I always thought that interviews were supposed to be a discussion rather than the candidate talking and other people listening but perhaps its different at Facebook.Other interviews were also average - my third interviewer was a girl who seemed too full of herself and kept being very sarcastic. My fourth interviewer hardly showed any interest in my thesis work though he was a very experienced guy so its possible, they are able to absorb everything without even listening.

The interviewer introduced himself, and talked a bit about his work. Then ask me about my research, and he was specifically interested in my image quality project.Then we started the coding question. The interviewer guided me towards the direction he wanted to go. Then in the end he gave 2 minutes for me to ask questions, I asked more about his research as it is related to mine.

Three rounds of phone interview. First two rounds are technical interviews, the final round is team match. The HR is very quckly in given feedback. Normal he will notify you whether you will have another round the same day of the phone interview.

Firstly there was a telephonic interview after I applied from the University and then after 1 month interview was setup. The question was asked by engineer and she helped me along the way. It went well but after a week got rejection

Passed phone check, 3 onsite interviews everything was great according interviewers, gave in average 3 solutions for each problem and after that they said that they cannot give an offer.

To begin the interview the interviewer told me what they do at Facebook and asked me to tell them about myself a little bit. I elaborated on a recent project I had been working on. Because of a shortage of time, no more personal questions were asked. Then we jumped straight into coding questions. At the very end I could ask about 7-10 minutes worth of questions about general Facebook…  information.

After two phone interviews I was flown in to the main campus for an on-site which consisted of four separate interview sessions and lunch. There was one design interview, one behavioral interview and two interviews purely focused on coding. Everyone was very friendly and professional.

A employee from the Ads department invited me to talk on Skype on time, he first introduced what the Ads department do and then he offered a link to me to work on a coding problem. After finish, he asked me the time and space complexity, and opened to answer any questions I have.

We had back and forth emails where they asked for my resume and choice of domain, product or infrastructure. Then, they scheduled my phone interview. The phone interview was with a facebook engineer. There were two phone interviews but I didn't make it to the second one. The interview was 45 minutes long. They took 4 to 5 days to tell me I hadn't been selected.

A 45 minute interview. The interviewer will first talk a little about your resume. He will pick a project and questions on it. And then he will write a problem on the board and will tell you to first explain him your thought process. After that you will have to implement the problem in the most efficient manner.

I applied through my school job website. Their interview process for the Software Engineer, Intern position is 2 technical interviews via Skype/phone. HR recruiter reached out to me through email and set up an interview with a software engineer. HR recruiter asked me initial background questions in the email such as: what teams would you like to be a part of. The software engineer used Skype for the first technical…  interview. The interviewer asked me questions about my resume and we used an online text editor for coding questions.

Recruiter reached out and scheduled two phone interviews. The interviews are all about solving algorithmic problems. After solving the problem, I asked some questions. Got feedback and offer in a week.

2 rounds phone Skype interview, each round lasted from 45 mins to 50 mins. The difficulty was average, hadn't met tough questions. The recruiter replied promptly and helped me a lot. The interviewers were kind and helpful, gave me hints during the interview. Got offer one week after the second round and I accepted it without doubt.

I applied online and about a month later was emailed asking to set up an hour long phone interview. Phone interview was between myself and a Facebook engineer while we were on a program that allowed him to see me code in real time. Was emailed a few days after phone interview by recruiter to tell me they were not going to pursue any further.

Applied online and heard back within a week or so, the first phone interview I was only asked "Tell me about yourself in 1-2 minutes" and one technical question, then saved about 5 minutes for questions. I was later asked about the time and space complexity of my program

It's a phone interview about 45 mins. First the interviewer asked me something about my resume, then we began to do coding. There are 2 questions to solve, and then you need to analyze the time complexity.

Apply on university job fair. It took about one week to hear back from Facebook and schedule first phone interview. The whole process moves very quick.The interview is a 45 minutes phone interview. The first 15 minutes was behavior questions and ask details in resume. Then it started to code.

Two technical rounds of interviews. Basic and straightforward data structures questions with a little bit of trivia (which I did not know). In my first round I got through two questions. In the second round, I got one question and was working through a second when I ran out of time. Both interviewers were great -- very helpful and supportive during the interview.

The process takes about 1 month. Referred by a friend. The interview questions are not hard and easy to prepare. 2 rounds of technical interviews and 1 round of team match interview. The technical interviews are easy to prepare. LeetCode will be helpful. In the team match interview, interviewer asked me about my research projects.

Recruiter on campus at Ivy League school, I decided to interview anyways despite never having programmed before (but having taken graduate level physics courses). Interviewer was nice and said they would ask me easier questions since I had never programmed before.

I was referred internally by my friend. I attended a phone interview after contacted by a recruiter. The interviewer actually told me directly on the phone that I should work more on my coding skill. So I was totally surprised to learn that the interviewer's feedback was positive and they'll continue with my application.All the following process was mostly coordinated by another recruiter, who is very responsive and I greatly…  appreciate his help. The on-site interview had 2 sessions before noon and 3 after, with the last one and lunch time not being evaluated.Originally I was told that I'll hear the result the next week, but instead I waited 2 weeks and learned that I didn't make it. The recruiter did emphasize that I was really close, and also let me know that it was the system design question that I didn't perform well. (There was yet another coding question that I found difficult, but the recruiter told me that they had no problem with my coding skill.)

just reviewed with HR, and HR asked you select facebook? this is very interesting question. I just answered I like facebook, this is a popular company. then HR ask me to introduce myself briefly.

Easy, was straightforward. There were three rounds of telephonic interview. All of them were simple algorithmic questions. They mostly stressed on the correctness of the code. Make sure you structure it well, and it's bug free.

The interview consisted of a phone interview, covering some algorithm design questions. Phone calls were totally technical, little discussion regarding experience etc. Questions had to do with big-O notation, algorithm design and complexity, and data structures.

I applied at a campus recruiting event and got an email a few days letter about scheduling an interview on campus. It was a 45 min technical one on one interview. He asked me one straightforward question (see below). A few days after the interview, I got an email inviting me to their Menlo Park location for another interview on campus. I flew out there for University Day and really…  enjoyed the whole experience. The interview was 45 mins again and the interviewer asked me two questions (see below). I thought I answered the questions really well in O(n) but did not get an offer.

Contacted by recruiter, scheduled phone interview after a couple weeks. She setup a tech interview. The interviewer was very hard to understand and did not explain the problem well, when I would ask for clarification on certain parts I couldn't understand him. He only asked one question which you will see below. Unlikely to get call back:

Applied at a career fair, and then got an email for an on-campus interview. The process was really quick, 2 weeks so far. They will notify for on-site interviews within a few days after the on-campus.

This is the first round technique interview which lasts about 45 minutes. The interviewer just asked one coding question and I spent almost 30 minutes to figure out what problem is it and what he wanted to test me, so I don't have time to finish the coding. It's important to prepare every kind of coding question and don't think you are lucky enough to not meet the problems that…  you are not familiar with.

I applied online and heard back from a recruiter in a few weeks. She asked me to answer a few questions about myself through email and then asked for my availability so we could schedule my first interview. A day after the first interview was done, we scheduled my second one.

I applied through a career center in school. The interviewers were nice and kind and the recruiter was really quick to respond. The interviews were not that hard so just don't be nervous (like me..) and it will be okay

A few weeks after I applied online, a recruiter reached out with an email about basically everything you need to know to interview. Two 45-minute skype interviews: first 5-10 minutes is introduction and resume/ past experience questions, then remaining is 2 technical questions. The questions I got are very similar to those on leetcode and CCI.

Great, the interviewer are really patient and very helpful during the interview process. You definitely can ask some guides for the interview questions. They don't limit your language to write code so just use the language which you are most comfortable with. On-site interview and university day of Facebook is really amazing. They will lead you to explore the whole Facebook campus and introduce a lot of fun stuffs of…  Facebook. Also, the food in Facebook is very very good. So glad I got the part!

Contacted by internal recruiter. Recruiter was really nice. Interviewer called on time. I had difficulty in understanding accent of interviewer. She introduced herself and straight went on for shared coding. Pretty standard questions. In the end, interviewer asked if I had any questions. In all, it was decent interview experience.

Applied online, contacted by recruiter in ~2 weeks. Had a phone interview. The interviewer did not say much, and when I had asked if I was going in the right direction, he said things along the lines of, whatever you think is right, which was not helpful at all. The question itself was moderately difficult, and would be really hard to solve without a bit of help, in my opinion,…  and the interviewer didn't seem to care much. He was pretty quiet the entire time, which made me nervous, but I suppose that is my own fault too. Overall, the phone round was pretty tough, and I would say to know your way around arrays and sorting very well.

It is very fast paced. Decisions always were made within two days. Although the problem seem to be easy, the requirement is very high. You should code in a decent, tidy and organized way.

A phone interview. A recruiter was very nice. At first he introduced himself. And he asked me please introduce yourself. And then he gave me a question. It seemed very simple but I should optimize time complexity of the question. I tried to use divide and conquer. I thought I can solve it by using while statement because I don't want to use recursion. It worked well but time complexity…  still depended on length of output. I regret that I should use recursion. Although I didn't get offer, it was good experience. Additionally, an interview process of Facebook was really fast and clear. I like it.

The engineer calls me on time. Then ask some behavior questions. Why facebook? etc. Then start to ask algorithm questions. after that you can ask some question to the interviewer.

It was alright. I think the interviewer could have been mush more polite. I think he had a bad day or something was wrong. He just had pre conceived answer and wasn't very comfortable to different approaches.

The first part was about 10 minutes of talking. Italked about one past project I did and its greatest challenge, and I also learned more about interviewer when he was an intern. Then it was 30 minutes of 2 technical questions. At the end, there were 5 minutes to ask any questions I had.

I applied through Career Fair in College and got called for on-campus interview. After 2 weeks, the interviewer notified me to go for an on-site interview. I chose San Francisco, at the headquarter of Facebook. The first question is easy when you only have to dfs or bfs to find all adjacent areas. The second question took place at the on-site, and it was a little bit harder than first…  one

I met with a manager at an on-site interview following a college career fair. We talked for a few minutes about my education and future plans. He immediately turned me down because "I didn't sound ambitious enough"

Applied through employee referral. Got a phone screen about two weeks later. Didn't get contacted for about 4.5 weeks, then was asked to come onsite to Menlo Park campus. The onsite was one 45 minute interview with one interviewer, and then a tour. Received a phone call the day after with the offer.

I applied at a FB info session at my school, and made it to the final round of applicants that they would consider. From there, I managed to get a phone screen. One big problem with 2 actual parts. Interviewer was nice, but I couldn't hear him well over the phone.

Phone interview.The HR arranged an phone interview after my application was referred by an current employee.The interviewer called on time. He introduced himself very quickly and also talked about what he is doing now for the job. After that he let me to talk about the most challenge project I have ever made. Then the coding question begins: he tried to mislead me by using a very long description about…  the question. For example, this is about PHP bla bla... But actually the question is about Depth First Search. There was just one question because I was slow. I think I will be rejected.

on campus at Menlo Park, which is called Facebook University Day. 45min technical interview, code on white board. After that we had a wonderful tour of Facebook Campus and had a lunch. The ice-cream was super good! After that, Facebook Engineers made presentations and lectures about how it feels to work at Facebook.

it was over the phone and the interviewer just went straight into the technical question.the lady was asian and had an accent that made it kinda hard to understand what she was saying sometime. At the end she asked if I had any questions about the company or internship.

Applied online after talking to a recruiter at a career fair, had an interview on campus and went to final round interviews during their "University Day." The process was fairly quick and the recruiters really make you feel welcome during your tour of facebook. There was a presentation about what an internship at facebook was like and lunch from their cafeteria. Each person gets their own individual interviewer and was…  taken to one of the many rooms in the building for their interview. There are 2 interviews total before you are given a decision.

45min technical phone interview. I was asked to give a short introduction of myself and went on with two technical questions. I have to say the questions was not that hard but took a lot time time. One is a hard tree question and I forgot the other one.

Got recruited during a career fair having previous established a relationship with my recruiter. Got called up for a phone interview. The engineer didn't even tell me his name and jumped right in during the process. The whole thing lasted 20 mins. I wished they would make the process a bit more personal.

Had two brief phone screening, first one was behavioral questions, next one was technical. Passed both and went for an online interview on Hackerrank. The question was easy but I believe I burnt too much time on the first one and the interviewers never got a chance to ask the rest of the questions.

Talked to them at the Career fair at our university. They really care about what outside projects you have done. heard back in a week and scheduled an interview with them in 5 days.

Applied through Career Fair at my University, Got called for an On campus interview.The Interviewer was very helpful. Started off with discussing my resume and asked two questions based on algorithms. The interview lasted for 45 minutes.Waiting to hear back

I was local to the Facebook offer so they did the screens in person. The first one did not go very well, but went well enough to get a second chance (as opposed to a full interview). The second one went better and I was invited back for a full day of interviews. They were able to rush the process since I had other offers.The full day interview was 4…  interviews. 1 system design question, 1 manager interview ("Tell me about a time..."), 2 algorithms questions. Everyone was welcoming and enthusiastic, so that made the stressful process easier.I got a call from the recruiter about 4 days later telling me they were not moving forward with an offer. A bit disappointing and it wasn't entirely clear why as I thought the interview went well. I was interviewing for a smaller office so maybe that made a difference.

First round of interview happened one month ago, and was informed one week after that I was invited to a onsite interview. As usual, it starts late, at noon. One system design, two coding and one culture. The interviews are not difficult, but do need solid knowledge on database design, basic data structure and algorithms. No more than string, pointer, graph and tree.

Applied through career fair. Got an on campus interview call after one week. Interview was scheduled 3 weeks after I got the email about being selected for the interview process. Facebook also hosted a dinner for all the people who were being interviewed.

Hiring was done through an on campus recruiting event. Very straightforward, submitted resume and was contacted by recruiter a week later to set up an interview time. Interview consisted of coding questions done on a white board. There was one person there who was observing. The overall atmosphere was very relaxed.

Directly went thru 2 technical questions, not pretty hard. After that, the interviewer allowed me to ask about him or the company. It lasted about 45 min and is a quite good interview experience.

Standard facebook interview process. I already had an offer from another big company and told the recruiter. He went about the process really fast. 1 phone interview. 4 technical onsite interviews. (3 coding and 1 system design). Very school like questions. Could answer everything except the system design. I could not connect with the interviewer which I feel is important for design questions and he was not verbose enough to…  explain the basic requirements of the system.

Messaged recruiter on LinkedIn a few months after being initially contacted. Set up for a phone screen about a week later.Phone screen consisted of online whiteboard with a question which took majority of interview time.

I submitted my resume through a resume book for a larger conference and then I got an email from a recruiter saying they were interested in having me for an interview. There was a pre-interview dinner where we got to talk to our interviewers. Then the next day was the actual interview. I didn't get an offer but it was an interesting process and my first technical interview so I…  didn't mind.

Facebook picked up my resume at the University career fair and scheduled an interview at the university career center after a week. The interview lasted about 50 mins and I was asked to write code on paper. I was asked one problem and then asked ways to improve the solution. I was expecting to get selected.

Phone interview organization is not very good. The interviewer of one phone interview was absent, wasting one afternoon. Onsite organization is really good.All questions are ordinary, seems they more care about the communication b/w you and the interviewer, and that is probably the reason I got rejected.Feedback was really fast, 3 days after interview.

Two runs of phone interview, all coding questions similar to leetcode, has to be bug free. The interviewers weren't very patient. The recruiter called back in a week saying that they won't go on.

Referred by a friend for an internship. After two weeks got a phone interview. The interviewer was nice, and after like 10 minutes behavioral questions I was given a technical problem. Passed the first interview, waiting for the second. Moderate question.

They came to campus for OCR. I walked into the interview room, introduced myself. He said hi, then we jumped straight into coding. His question was straight forward and I gave him the optimal solution and coded it up. I was sure to talk through the problem with him as I approached it and he told me he liked my implementation. I'm not sure why I wasn't offered a second…  round.

First round is on campus interview, the second round is Menlo Park on site interview.The major process of both rounds is white board coding, there are 2-3 questions each round, interviewer will discuss a little bit about resume projects ahead. The most important is white board coding and you have to tell the time space complexity of your code.

Whiteboard questions made overly complicated for the sake of being complicated versus accessing skills. The feedback I received was that the coding portion wasn't up to par, which tells me that had I been hired there my work would have been nit-picked to death, sabotaged, and argued with. No wonder Facebook products are what they are. I'm satisfied that the interview revealed the fit wasn't a good fit in both…  directions.

1) Facebook recruiter contacted me on LinkeIn, requesting resume2) Talked to recruiter over the phone3) Was invited to on-site interview4) Talked about my prior experience5) Asked about job experience in Facebook6) As part of interview they offered to write a program on the whiteboardWas interviewed in newly built nice building in Menlo Park. Interestingly, there were a lot of empty cubicles, probably people were working remotely.Nice buffet with drinks and…  pastries.

I am an experienced engineer. My phone interview was pretty standard. I got through 2 coding questions, and had a great chat with the interviewer. I was called onsite shortly.Onsite I had 5 modules. 3 "ninja modules", which are coding based, 1 "jedi module" which is behavioral/resume/experience and a small coding problem, and 1 "pirate module", which is system design. I've done interviews with Google and LinkedIn as well (and…  got offers from both), and the coding problems at Facebook were actually the simplest. I smashed all the coding interviews. The Jedi interview was pretty good too.The place where I failed was the pirate module. If you are interviewing with FB, I cannot stress enough that you really really need to prep system design. I actually failed my design interview spectacularly (they asked me to design a popular feature on FB). But based on my other performances, they decided to call me back the next week for another system design interview. Well, I failed that one too, LOL. Yes, apparently I was that bad at system design.It is strange, because at Google I was specifically told that the system design interview was used to "slot" a software engineer only (senior, staff, etc.). i.e. it was not a dealbreaker. For FB, apparently it is a dealbreaker. Personally I think every one has certain strengths and weaknesses. I readily admit that my weakness is system design. My strength is algorithms and coding, and I've actually done pretty well in competitive programming as well. But FB really would prefer to see someone who knows a decent amount about everything, rather than be really good at one thing (algorithms and coding) and not great at another (system design).As far as the interviewers go, they were an amazing bunch. Even when I was bombing the system design module, the interviewer was very respectful, encouraging, and friendly. I walked away with a very positive experience. Everyone was excited to be working there, and I can see that it is a terrific place!If you are interviewing there, my advice is to really read up on many many open source architectures, and thoroughly understand system design. If you clear that module, you will almost certainly get in, the other stuff isn't hard at all.

Phone screen test of duration 45 mins where interviewer started with briefly describing what he works on and straight away went to asking the interview question. Towards the end he left 5 minutes for me to ask questions.

I applied to Facebook through their website and got a call from the recruiter the next day. He asked the standard screening questions and set up a technical phone screen for later that week.The phone screen was done using coderpad.io, and they threw me off from the very beginning by setting up a C++ environment although I had told the recruiter that I was most comfortable in Python and although…  I never claimed anywhere that I had any familiarity with C++. Still, interview questions tend to be general enough that, as long as you aren't completely unfamiliar with the language syntax, you can generally do a decent job in any language. So off we went in C++.The interviewer was very pleasant, and even gave me some tips for how to improve my resume at the beginning. Then we dived into the coding. He had actually chosen a great question to determine my programming ability. Unfortunately, I botched it by making too many assumptions about the question and not considering carefully enough what lay behind the interface that the interviewer had provided me.This all happened maybe two or three weeks ago and I am sure that I won't be progressing to the next step. The one negative in all this is that the recruiter has not followed up at all with me. Yes, rejection is not uncommon when applying at a company like Facebook, but that doesn't mean that the company shouldn't have the courtesy to at least inform you of it.So overall, great experience in the beginning but I was turned off by the lack of respect for the process that I sensed from the recruiter.

I was reached by a Facebook recruiter through referral program. The recruiter was very quick, and I was phone interviewed in next couple of days. The coding question is not difficult, but has to be bug free for all coding questions. I answered two coding questions, and the last question had a followup question. The followup question is a bit difficult, so I messed up with some coding details.

This was the onsite interview. Before this one, I had to pass two phone interviews. The interview was very casual, more like a chat. The interviewer was nice and interesting. He helped me find some corner cases to the problem. It was overall a positive experience

Asked a friend to refer me. Was contacted by a recruiter within two days. Quickly scheduled a tech-screen (essentially mini-ninja interview). After that came the on-site loop.2 ninja, 2 pirate and 1 jedi interviews. Can't share specific questions, but plenty of other people did already. Unlike Google (interviewed with them also), Facebook seems to have a smaller question pool as one of the system design questions I got I've also…  seen on Glassdoor before.I recommend going through the information recruiters provide for interview preparation. Since Google and Facebook use very similar processes, "Stevey's Blog Rants: Get that job at Google" post is also quite relevant and useful. Know your data-structures, algorithms, practice solving problems for a few weeks and you should be in good shape.For system design questions, you will be asked to design Facebook-scale systems. Think data way beyond the scope of one machine, billions of items, thousands of requests per second. Hands on experience with such systems is of course "the king". In the absence of that - study distributed NoSQL systems, MapReduce and similar things and you should be in good shape.Overall I was very happy with the on-site interviews and the level of support Facebook recruiters and engineers provided me. This was probably the best interview experience that I've had.Having a competing offer handy will surely help you negotiate better compensation. Facebook seems to have an awesome culture. Deciding to reject their very generous offer for another one wasn't an easy call. One really can't go wrong by joining Facebook.Facebook is the only company that I know that provides interview feedback. Regardless whether you pass or not I recommend asking for it as it will help you get better.

I was contacted by a recruiter and had a phone chat with her the next day. After a week, I went to to the in-house interview. I arrived 5 minutes before the scheduled time and I waited for 20 minutes in the reception area. My scheduled interviewer could not make it and they found a young engineer to interview me instead.He is friendly and has worked in the industry for…  only 2 years. The conversation started almost like I was the interviewer as he introduced himself and told me what he does at Facebook for about 5 minutes. He asked me what I do in my current project and proceeded with a coding question. I solved the question in Java, tested edge cases, modularized the solution and discussed other potential solutions I could think of. We had a nice conversation and the interviewer agreed the solution given was good. He ended the interview by giving me the opportunity to ask any questions.They did not proceed to the next stage with me and I was surprised. Obviously I missed something and I do not know what that is. I asked the recruiter for feedback via e-mail and did not hear back.

I was ask to answer a few question about my resume and followed two coding questions. For each question, the interviewer asked the time and space complexity and how to improve them. At the end, he asked me whether if I had questions for him or the company.

Initial 45 minute screen: whiteboard coding problem, algorithmically simple, but with oddities.Full loop: 6 x 45-minute sessions: 2 coding, 2 design, 1 cultural/technical (tell a story about a difficult experience and how I overcame), 1 lunch (off-the-record chance to ask tons of questions about company culture)

Interview was a tough one the no of rounds depend on the college you did graduation or post graduation from it could be 6 rounds or it can even be as length as 12 whole rounds it is going to be a long day for a interviewer as well as you

Very friendly and open. Strong emphasis on problem solving and interpersonal skills and little emphasis on technical minutiae. (The initial interview was pure code but no gotcha questions.)The on site interview was four one hour sessions with either one or two people (the second being a shadow interviewer in training) with fifteen minutes of algorithm stuff and forty five of problem solving. (One was just problem solving).The only negative with…  all this is that it was very compressed (no breaks between sessions except for lunch which was with another employee)I was recalibrated afterwards and had to do an extra interview by phone. (I scored high on a newly added question so I was reinterviewed on the question it replaced.) The result was that my offer improved.Throughout the process everyone involved was friendly, open, and within limits helpful.

The recruiter contacted me. The recruiting process is very pleasant and considerate. They even have an interview prep session that the author of cc150 gave presentation about how to ace the interview, which is very helpful. Passed the first onsite screen and moving to next step so below questions may not be applicable.

Contacted by HR via LinkedIn. Went through phone coding screening, will be going for onsite. The phone interviewer was nice, the question EAS not difficult and it took some t8me to complete. Onky one question was asked, and we had enough time left to discuss aspects of ongoing project that he is working.

I've applied through an employee referral and got a ping from the recruiter in about a week. After the initial chat with the recruiter to chat about FB, my interests and logistics, I got scheduled for the initial 45-minute screening. I was given two options for the screen, either phone/codeshare or an onsite visit (likely an option available for local candidates only). I chose the in-person option, and got an…  invite for a round of full day (5 total) within few hours after the initial screen.Facebook recruiters send interview prep materials to the candidates on what to expect, what to brush up on, as well as some suggestions tailored to a particular candidate's weak-ish spots (in my case it was the speed of coding). I knew what to expect going in and felt well prepared on this front.Initial screen was algorithm + coding. Nothing overly challenging.Onsite consisted of 5 interviews (+ informal lunch) covering:1) One "Jedi" interview with a hiring manager testing behavior / culture fit + warm-up coding. Prepare to talk about past experience, career goals, as well as several "tell me about the time when..." questions.2) One "Pirate" interview: System design portion of the interview. There are great resources on Quora on suggestions on how to prepare and what to pay attention too.3) Three "Ninja" interviews focusing on algorithm + coding. I actually have seen all of the questions I got asked at Facebook before, but that did not help me as ultimately the reason for rejection was cited as not being able to come up with optimal solutions and code fast enough.Got an phone call from the recruiter in about a week+few days after the interview telling me the unfortunate news. I think I had to wait few extra days because of the July holidays and typically the process is faster.Culture: I did find some of the junior Facebook engineers conducting my interview a bit arrogant and cocky, but nothing too alarming.All in all, I had a positive interview experience. I wish the interview loop was better tailored towards someone more senior, e.g. less emphasis on coding, more on design. Current interview process makes it seem they hire code monkeys.

I had two interviews and each takes 45 mins. I answered each smoothly and near perfectly. All bug-free code. But they still reject me without giving any reason or feedback.

If you're a solid developer with years of experience working on high visibility products used by millions of people (and references to back it up) don't expect the interview process at Facebook to just work. It really comes down to how much you prepare yourself mentally to code within the context of an interview, and how much you study Career Cups as well as the other resources given to you…  by the recruiter. Sadly, you don't have to be a great developer at all.What's interesting is that none of these skills have been necessary during my 17 years of real world experience. I never had to write code on a whiteboard (except for other interviews) and I don't see how "writing code fast" should be considered a measurement of someone's productivity and code quality. That sort of thinking seems naive and haphazard to me.What frightens me is that I think Facebook truly believes they're "raising the bar" with this system. But they're not always hiring good people, and they're probably turning down a lot of great folks.The coding tests were super easy. Two were questions I've actually asked myself while conducting interviews for another company which was aimed towards entry level developers. I really wish they would have asked more challenging questions. I was able to finish them before the end of each panel, and with optimal solution.The design question they gave me actually aligned with something I developed and designed for a product used by millions. I felt good with how everything went at the end of the day, but somehow I failed at *both* coding and design. Interesting... whatever.Two of my friends--whom of which I mentored at my last company--were able to get offers at Facebook (same office, same interview process) but they were *not* the best coders nor the top performers, so if you get turned down at Facebook, don't take it seriously. They say there is some "randomness" in the interview, but it just seems strange that common sense didn't kick anywhere to question the obvious, or just the fact I was interviewed by a few people with only 5 years experience. Smart, but inexperienced (and somewhat arrogant) wanting to judge you with entry level coding questions.Half of the people that interviewed me didn't go through the interview process themselves. They were brought in by acquisitions. Specifically for a product that isn't doing very well right now.I was excited about the idea of working there initially, but after the interview, I wasn't so sure anyway. They do try to put a lot of emphasis on finding great developers, but many of the folks who interviewed me mentioned the codebase was a mess (probably from writing code so quickly and not thinking through it) And their open office (no cubes, no walls, just wires and computers everywhere) is a bit distracting. Not something genuinely appreciated by the people working there who used to have their own office. When you need to focus and get quality work done, there are only so many dedicated rooms to use and they're usually taken.Coupled with the fact that they're Seattle office is located in one of the worst traffic areas, I wasn't so sure I would have accepted anyway.

Referred by school mate and got the phone interview. Failed in the first round interview. No questions on resume. Just two coding questions. First one is easy. I just said minHeap solution, then the recruiter directly said next. I was stuck at the second problem and that is the reason why I failed.

Recruiter contacted me on Linkedin.I requested for in person interview in place of telephonic. Arranged a 1 hour interview at Menlo park office. Cleared the interview and was called for a six round interview.Interview was strange.Easy and not so complex algorithmic rounds. Not sure what is so special about those rounds or whether they were even part of the decision making. Interviewers were happy with the answers and not much…  corrections.Then there were these design rounds. One of the rounds was about designing location services. The interviewer was very knowledgeable. Pointed out my in-efficiencies with the choice of data-structure. Enjoyed it.Then started the real fun in the final round. An awesome interviewer with an awesome attitude. He spoiled my interview experience though. Asked me to design a messaging app system. Once the interviewer breaks the comfort zone, it would be a difficult place to stand. His expressions were horrible and sometimes I felt like saying "shut-up and listen first" which I didn't say obviously. When I mentioned that the server knows the ip address of client only when the server receives a packet from client. He said, there are a lot other ways it happens. I mentioned the only way is clients packet to the server. He made it an argument and finally I had to ask him to mention a way. He skipped the part and asked me to move on :-DIgnoring the final round, I actually enjoyed the interview process. No offer though :-)

Contacted by HR and setup a meeting, the HR is kind and the engineer is also kind, but I got nervous and blew it. Should have refresh my skills before going into an interview.

4 RoundsRound 1: Talking with recruiter and see if your interest align with FacebookRound 2: Phone Screen (45 Minutes) Algorithm and Data StructureRound 3: Phone Screen (45 Minutes) Algorithm and Data StructureRound 4: Onsite for entire day- 2 Coding- 1 Design- 1 Experience- 1 Hiring Manager

I started off with a standard technical phone screen with a Facebook engineer. It was a simple coding exercise with two questions of surprisingly low difficulty. I cleared this easily.Facebook's on-site interview process is far more rigorous, though. Each 45-min interview has a clearly defined role, intended to test you from multiple different angles. Specifically, I went through:- 2 "Ninja" interviews (coding & algorithms)- 2 "Pirate" interviews (system design)- 1…  "Jedi" interview (behavioral & simple coding)plus lunch with a Facebook engineer.The "Ninja" and "Jedi" interviews were straightforward. I hadn't seen the coding questions before, but they were not particularly hard. I would rate them as being of just average difficulty, pretty similar to the whiteboard coding questions asked at most other major Silicon Valley tech companies. And the behavioral section of the "Jedi" interview was just a friendly chat about my resume and my past experiences.However, the "Pirate" interviews were what killed me. Both "Pirate" interviews involved being asked to propose and discuss a design for existing features on Facebook. The interviewers were extremely meticulous and questioned me on virtually every last detail of my design decisions. In particular, they focused a lot on how huge datasets should be stored and accessed to support extremely large-scale distributed systems. Even though I am already working on web-scale systems in my current job, I was nonetheless still way under-prepared for this level of technical challenge and scrutiny.My advice to all prospective candidates is to spend most of your time preparing for the "Pirate" interviews. The coding questions aren't hard, but the system design questions will likely stretch you to your limit! (Unless you're a fresh grad--they don't ask "Pirate" questions to fresh grads. Lucky folks!)Additional side note: interestingly, my Facebook recruiter actually gave me detailed post-mortem feedback on each and every one of my interviews. They are the only major Silicon Valley company I know that does this, so major kudos to them for being so considerate.

Onsite interview process was fair. Difficulty level was average. First person to interview me had horrible communication skills. He couldn't explain coding problem clearly.Remaining three people were very good in communication. After on-site interview, facebook requested for yet another coding phone interview.Post onsite phone interview is what went wrong with me. This person had poor interview skills. He asked me an advanced algorithm question about graph/tree traversal (search for "same…  fringe problem concurrency" and you will know what I am talking about). I gave a natural solution which was not space efficient, but interviewer was looking for a specific solution he had in mind.I lost the deal to this question. I would give thumbs up to recruiters handling interview process. I think they are one of the best in the industry.

Coding on a white board. An easy question. Made bugs and did not finished but get through anyway - the recruiter was rather grading the thought process than details, which was a big positive surprise for me.

I talked to an engineer at college career fair, got a first round interview for the following week. The interview was a 1:1 technical interview that lasted 45 minutes. The recruiter hosted a meet and greet session with all the engineers and interviewees the night before interviews began so everyone could get to know their interviewer in a more relaxed setting.

Phone Screen 45 min duration in total, the interviewer said a little bit about himself and went straight to a technical question. No background questions. The interview process went as expected, no surprises. The interviewer seemed to be a nice guy.

Took multiple months as I was not available. The recruiter did an excellent job in making sure that I take the interview. The interview took 45 mins and started with details about my previous work experience. That took about 20 mins and then I was left with 20 mins for the programming question. He gave me a problem related to BST. Obviously I need to draw the tree etc and…  he cannot see that on phone interview. I started with multiple approaches and he told specifically what I need to do eg. give only recursive solution, you can only store few things no extra space. In the end i was able to solve with a minor hint and he was also telling me to fix bugs as I was coding as well indent code as per his standards. Overall it was a good experience but I did not get the offer as they are looking for people who can code in like 10 mins as I was able to code in 15-20 mins. They want bug free code and will only go forward with the best candidate. I think even if you do a minor mistake you are out as there is someone else who will solve it perfectly so try to solve it perfectly :)Another important lesson is if you get option of phone v/s in person interview, I will say go for in person interview as it gives the interviewer the chance to see what you are doing on paper verses imagining that over phone.

Internal recruiter contacted me. I had an initial phone screen with recruiter, including a couple basic technical questions, followed by a phone screen with an engineer where we coded on a collaborative editing Web site. Heard back the next day and we scheduled for an on-site. On-site consisted of 4 interviews, two technical, one architectural, and one behavioral. All interviews involved writing on a white board (actually just writing on…  the wall in a small room).Recruiters were consistently punctual and professional. Interviewers were friendly and helped keep the process low-stress.

The interview lasts 60 mins. First he introduced where he was working at and then ask for more details about my projects on my resume. Then he posted a technical question. I first discussed the solution to him and wrote it in C++. After all, I asked some questions like the daily responsibilities on that position.

First, there was a phone screen with the recruiter, a technical screen (either phone or on site, candidate's choice), and an on site.The recruiter was very professional and helpful, describing the process and the engineering culture at Facebook. They were very flexible in scheduling both the phone screen and onsite.The phone screen was a standard technical phone screen, with the difficulty dialed up slightly. The solutions allowed were constrained (typically,…  constant space). After I presented my solution, we discussed its complexity.The on site was very similar. The interview was very CS heavy. The questions asked relied on the knowledge of the properties of many data structures, including ones that are less often used. I can't recall any technical trivia questions being asked; all the questions surrounded a problem with an implementation that had to be coded on the white board. Parallelism and threads were also covered. I gave my answers in Python, and except for one interviewer that asked for a solution using Java, all accommodated. There was one design and architecture review which as different and a lot of fun. I was asked to design a system for a current feature of Facebook. The interviewers were great to interact with.I had a couple offers that were exploding, and they said they would be able to get a decision back quick. But there was an offsite, so the decision was delayed a few days. I withdrew when I accepted another offer. To put it in context, my other offers were exploding within 72 hours of the on site, so it was a tall order and it's to their credit that they tried.I left very impressed. When I'm looking for a position in the future, I'll definitely check them out.

Applied online; heard back within a few weeks. Set up a phone interview with an engineer which involved collaborative coding questions. I didn't do very well, and got a denial email a week or so later.

Meet female recruiter at check in station. Move to different room where you meet someone else, a male dev from Facebook. Not really interesting in learning anything about me or if I was a robot, so straight to whiteboard questions.

Phone call, code test phone interview. Asked one coding question, like all the interview questions that you can find online, it was judged by if you can recite those solutions as quick as possible, not thought process. Interviewer was not experienced.

2 coding question , on 1st question they asked time and space complexity. second question divide number by a noter without using "/" and "%".The interviewer was good and provide hints when i am stuck . it was a good experience.the interview lasted for 50 minutes. i advise to practice lots of code on editor like coderpad.io / styli.com. This will help a lot in long run.I am waiting for…  there response!!!

The process is straight forward , it consisted of multiple rounds , begins with screening , technical interview , and then HR and technical round at headquarters.My phone screening was easy totally based on resume and then there were two technical rounds online to be taken one to one

The phone interview was fairly straight forward and fair. The interviewer was nice and answered all of my questions. I actually had to reschedule my phone interview twice and I am grateful how they handled it. Overall the interview was simple if you are experience it CS and I simply screwed up.

1 phone screen followed by 4 on campus interviews. Standard coding questions, one highly scalable design questions, questions about past projects. Check out David Malan scalability lecture on YouTube. That's a good starting point. Write code

I applied on facebook site, and was contacted not so long after, told to schedule a date for an interview. I was called exactly the time given, interviewer went straight to the point. He gave a very brief introduction about himself and we went straight to coding. He asked me just one question but I couldn't give the right answer as I did not go over some basic data structures.I…  would advice that if you have an interview for any SWE, you should go over everything!

Roughly 45 min phone interview starting with introducing yourself and your working experience,Academic experience etc.Then a coding exercise using an online document sharing with a C language algorithmic question.i.e Without using STL or other external libraries.The question is a basic String Algorithm question.

Had a phone interview. Interviewer was very friendly and explained her work at Facebook. She asked for my introduction, then proceeded to a coding question.Advice: Definitely go over glass door questions and be able to do other variations of the problems here.

Met recruiter at the Facebook offices, she showed me around. Because I was applying for an engineering position, it started on the engineering floor, which isn't too big. Nice offices but nothing super special, she did mention they were moving fairly soon. After the brief tour went down to the 2nd floor and went to a small room for the technical screen. An engineer came in and for a minute…  or two asked me about my background and work experience. Then went and asked me two technical questions. The first one was pretty straight forward, but I spent a long time explaining my thought process and debugging and everything. (As a ton of sites say you do). Second one was a bit more of a puzzle question and stumbled a little on it, basically it was a binary search algorithm. Unfortunately a miscommunication at the beginning of the question caused me to try to think of it in a different direction, but eventually got it and realized time was up so I quickly coded the solution and debugged it, but didn't explain myself probably because I knew the time was up.Ultimately got both questions right with a minor stumble and then was not asked for a further interview, so I really have no idea why, and unfortunately I understand for legal ramifications why they can't tell me. However not getting past the screen was unexpected.

I have interviewed with facebook 3 times. every time they ask the same stupid question given an array of integers, find 3 integers that sum to zero. as many as 3 people from HR get involved to schedule a simple phone screen. and even after solving the problem in O(n^2) time, i did not get any on-site with them.

I applied through employee referral. I got an email from a recruiter with a questionnaire asking about my experience, why facebook, etc. Next step was a phone interview. The interviewer was very nice and helpful. The interview question was not difficult. I gave an optimal solution with some help, also finished coding in time. I don't know what they don't like about the interview, but probably I was not very…  fast coding and testing the code. I got an email after a few hours that they do not want to move forward.

applied online. Contected by recruiter for initial screening in facebook office. When to local fb office, where I waited for few minutes after getting to reception. First, recruiter gave tour of center and talked about perks and then took me to conference room, where I met interviewer whole first discussed about my past projects and then jumped on coding question.

Onsite tech screen followed by 4 1:1 rounds. Three of the technical rounds were on coding questions and one of them had a design problem. Most of the technical problems were easy but I didn't code well probably because I didn't take enough time to practice whiteboard coding. The design round had an interesting problem. I'll probably appear in this once more in a year. All interviewers were good and…  well-behaved. The process was smooth as well. The recruiter communicated my area of weakness (coding) and I concur with what they found.

Contacted by a technical recruiter, and did a short talk about the potential position I was interested. The technical recruiter is very nice and responsible. Then did a telephone interview by an engineer from Facebook. The engineer asked something like why I chose Facebook, and asked me to solve one problem.

I had two technical interviews (they are not back-to-back, with about a two-week interval) plus one team matching interview on the phone. The whole process took 4~5 weeks. In both tech. interviews, there were two simple algorithm problems. My interviewer shared me a link on collabedit and I just coded there. All questions were quite basic and nothing surprising happened.

submit my resume through internal referal. Got contacted by someone a new established department in Facebook. He give me a 10 minute quick chat about this newly established department, and set up a first round interview a week after that. I did bad in that interview. Although it's a very common data structure/ algorithm problem

I had applied online for a summer internship. Recruiter reached out to me and scheduled phone interview. I got through first round phone interview. Second round was also phone interview. It went pretty well but I did not get an offer. Interviewers asked some basic questions about my background, projects etc. Then they spoke a bit about their background. Interviewers are friendly and helpful.

There are two phone screens followed by a day of on-site interviews which consist of technical interviews similar to the phone screens but also one on culture and another on system architecture.

HR sent me email to let me choose to interview onsite or through phone.I choosed to do it on site. Everything was great, we had good chat at there.The whole process tooks about 45 minutes in a small room. I was asked to code on a white wall.The question was not that hard, but I was too nervous to code it with several obvious bug - although I figure them…  out by myself.I got rejected in the next day for no reason. I've heard that they are looking for bugs-free programmer.

Applied online and quickly received a schedule for a phone technical interview. Got onto a coderpad.io call with an engineer. I'm bad at technical interviews, so it was a grueling thirty minutes of him helping me through the problem. Got an email within a few days saying I would not move ahead.

My friend referred me, and then a recruiter contacted me after several days. A phone screen interview was scheduled two weeks later. About 1 week, the recruiter told me I didn't pass the interview.

Process:This is for undergrad full-time software candidates in USA. Submitted resume at college career fair. Got email about on-campus interviews. At this stage, there are 3 possible outcomes: onsite invitation, a phone interview for an additional chance, or reject. I was invited to onsite interview.Onsite was a "University Day" that included three interviews (not four like they said in the email) before lunch and then a tour, new-hire panel, etc…  after lunch.All interviews were 45-mins length.Interviews themselves:On-campus interview: 3 coding questions. I don't remember signing any NDA at this point so, the questions were k-Nearest Points to Origin, finding a substring, and 3-sum.On-site interview: 3 interviews, 45 mins each. 1st interview: 2 coding questions. 2nd interview: behavioral questions (about team conflict, etc.) and a coding question. 3rd interview: 2 coding questions. Coding questions were easy and required *no knowledge* of special algorithms or data structures (such as graphs, DP, trees, etc). Recursion and strings were common.I did not get an offer from Facebook; however, I received offers from other companies. The interview questions themselves were considerably easier at Facebook than those asked at Google, LinkedIn, MS, Amazon, etc.Since the questions are not very hard, my guess is the decision is based upon fit and most importantly how *quickly* you were able to arrive at your solution and how *perfect* your code was. Make sure you focus and are confident.Advice: practice the easier questions and practice coding them. Also, looking at some of the other experiences on Glassdoor, it looks like a majority of the questions are re-used.

I went campus career fair and give the resume. I wait one month and got nothing. So I changed to ask for reference and got a interview after one week.

I emailed a recruiter my resume stating that I would like to intern at Facebook over the Summer. I got a call back in about a week. She asked me "Why Facebook" and to describe one of my favorite projects. After about 15 minutes she said she would move me on to the next round of interviews.

I was contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn. The time between indicating to the recruiter that I was interested to the date of the final set of onsite interviews was about 1 month.I'm local to Facebook HQ, so for the initial screening interview I was given the option to do it over the phone or onsite (I chose the latter). The interviewer asked me about my recent work history, and…  asked me to solve a couple of coding problems.I returned a couple of weeks later for 5 onsite interviews, which consisted of 2 coding, 2 design, and 1 fit interview. Most of the interviews were good experiences, except for one where I unfortunately got stuck on a problem and the interviewer just sat there watching me while I struggled.

Initial contact by hr. Phone screen for thirty minutes. They just go by syntax so unless you are a college graduate or prepare with focus it's not possible to break into. Even the offered solution even if it works may not be liked by the interviewer. It's a dicey game. Also it feels like they want you to join if you have any idea for them, not that they have…  a project in mind for you, so I doubt the job is sustainable.

First round telephone interview, it lasted about 1hour, not very difficult. The engineer is very helpful. After you finished your codes, he might change the request and made you modify your codes.

I didn't end up getting an offer.Due to NDA I cannot explicitly write down the questions, but look at the last 150 questions in Glassdoor and CareerCup and you'll do fine (I did fine in the coding rounds, get to that in a bit).Usual advice: Do a lot of white-boarding for questions and be ready to talk extensively about your projects and architecture and design.Screening Round:I applied to Facebook by…  getting connected to a recruiter through a colleague and friend. The process started in Seattle and I opted for a in-person onsite interview for the screening round (they have this option for locals in Seattle/California).The interview went well i.e. I figured out how to solve the question in optimal time and space complexity. I made some mistakes here and there while writing the solution down but the interviewer didn't seem to mind. Contrary to what I had heard, he wasn't too anal about syntax (also helped that I write in C# he wasn't very familiar with it)Onsite Round:I received an email from the recruiter that they wanted to move forward and call me onsite. I was like, cool!I took around 2 weeks to prepare and also tried to do design questions. I felt a bit under prepared around design and tried to make up for it in the last few weeks by watching videos around cloud architecture (and open source stuff like Hadoop, Kafka and Storm).Onsite was pretty straightforward. First round was a career fit/discussion and I did pretty well (I think). It was mainly some behavioral questions and a lot diagrams around the architecture in my current and previous projects.Second round was the one that I messed up.The question was around designing an existing Facebook feature (as a hint, think about the various add-dons you see on FB and instagram like Chat, Search, latest friend related news or popular links). When you really dig into designing this feature, its quite complicated and requires a reasonable amount of knowledge around distributed data storage etc. etc.You need to nail this round to get into Facebook (in my personal opinion). I'm guessing they will adjust their expectations based on your years of experience.There was a lunch which was informal and two more coding rounds where they asked questions that were very similar to the ones I had practiced. I made some silly mistakes here and there but again (due to practice) came up with optimal time/space complexity answers.Got my result exactly one week from the my onsite date. No offer. But learnt a lot.

Recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn. Had a chat on the phone and decided to mutually move ahead. The first round was a basic phone round with a software engineer ( nothing too difficult ). Cleared it and came onsite. As known, the pattern onsite is one behavioral interview with a coding question followed by 2 coding interviews and 1 design interview.Will not disclose the onsite questions due to…  NDA.The behavioral interview person was yawning throughout the 40 minutes and the coding interview question asked at the end of the behavioral interview was one of those questions which you either know/ don't know. I was expected to know the solution and code it in 10 minutes which pretty much negated the problem solving aspect of it.The 2 coding round questions were pretty standard. However, one of the questions was a text book question and I stated that I knew the solution to that question following which the question asked was way too tough to be solved in 25 minutes on the white board.Similarly the design interview involved a lot of math and was more difficult than coming up with an architecture . This had been informed prior to the interview though.Overall : The interview experience was mixed probably because most of the questions seemed to be the type of questions that one would/ wouldn't know. There was very little problem solving aspect to the whole process and sadly that is pretty much the case with some interviews for tech companies

It was a good experience . Awesome campus , very nice experience . Each interview was 45 minutes. Complete code in time is pressure. Practice in pen paper helps lot . Interviewers were nice , for coding need to cover edge case and test case.

Contacted by a recruiter, and first phone interview was after two weeks but I rescheduled. And the interview went really well. The interviewer was late for 10 mins, but he made it up at the end. And he was really helpful during the process.

2 Onsites to replace phone interviews since I'm local. Was contacted by a recruiter to interview. Was not sure I was interested but figured it was worth the experience. Office had a pretty immature, unprofessional vibe to it. Maybe more for young people just coming out of college?

I had my friend referred me to the intern position. It took about 3 weeks to hear from a recruiter. The process was pretty easy. After only one phone interview I was invited to go onsite. The phone interview takes 45 minutes. First talked about one of my previous projects. Then two technical problems.

Two Phone interviews with technical questions. I was referred by my friend working at Facebook. First, I had a phone interview with an engineer. The question was not harder than other companies' like Google. But He expected me to write completely a neat and bug-free code in less than 15min. After the 1st phone interview, I was told that I need to have another one in a week. The 2nd…  one was very similar to 1st one.Make sure to be prepared for writing a clean code fast.

I was originally contacted by a recruiter after I submitted my application through a University Grad portal.1. 45 minute on-campus interview with a technical question and some general fit questions.2. Flew out to their Seattle office for University Day.There were three 45 minute interviews: One behavioral interview (Jedi) and two coding interviews (Ninja). The coding interviews covered fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms. I signed an NDA so I…  can't tell you about specific questions, but you don't need to review very specialized information. Just make sure you know the basic data structures/algorithms and how to apply them.3. A week later, I received an offer and accepted.The Facebook recruiters are by far the most helpful and efficient recruiters that I've ever worked with. Most e-mails are responded to within a few hours and made me feel very comfortable throughout the process.

Was contacted by facebook recruiter. I thought I will give it a try. I selected in person tech screen vs phone interview since I think it is much easier to express yourself in person, plus there is whiteboard. Especially, if it is a graph or tree problem, easier to draw on whiteboard.I had to sign NDA unfortunately, so won't be able to share the exact question. But for a software…  engineer (not senior), the question was pretty hard to solve in 40 minutes. Backtracking was required and the best solution to the problem is n! (n factorial). So if you haven't heard of the problem before, it is quite likely you will spend time just on finding an optimal solution before jumping to code. That's what I did. However, I was able to code most of the solution and interviewer seemed happy. He himself told me that.Interviewer was pretty nice. He answered my questions pretty well and seemed down to earth, only thing I am not sure is the choice of question. I was informed that they will not move ahead with the on-site round, which is what I expected.

I was first contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn. We had a quick chat on the phone before he scheduled a phone screen with an engineer. I don't remember the question from the phone screen, but it was a standard coding screening type interview of about 30 minutes. There was a little bit of time for other questions, but the focus was entirely on coding ability.A few days later, the…  recruiter contacted me again and arranged for an on site interview in Seattle. I had four approximately hour long interviews with a shorter lunch interview part of the way through. Although the interviews were themed (e.g., "pirate", "ninja", etc.), all were very focused on coding except for one which focused on architecting a system.Several of the coding questions required figuring out the trick underlying the problem in order to get a good solution quickly. Many other companies have stopped asking these kinds of questions since they've found they are not very good at identifying the best people to hire. I felt like I reached satisfactory solutions for each of the questions, but based on feedback I received from the recruiter afterward it was clear they would have preferred me to have been faster.Everybody I interviewed with was friendly and fairly organized, but the sole emphasis on coding and problem solving questions turned me off to the interview process. While it's important to suss out a candidate's technical abilities, these questions don't do a very good job of that. Moreover, they completely ignore other qualities a senior engineer needs to succeed such as cultural fit, leadership abilities, ability to motivate/influence others, having vision, etc. Overall it felt like the process was overly tailored towards entry level college hires instead of mid-career professionals with existing experience.I did not get an offer, but would not have accepted anyways.

The interview was a phone screen; the first 10-15 minutes asked me about my research, and then I had to code a palindrome detection algorithm. I answered the question eventually, but I had a couple of bugs while writing and this did not seem to please the interviewer, who wanted to ask follow-up questions.

Applied for an iOS position - was initially contacted via LinkedIn. Overall really enjoyed the process. Was quite drawn out due to personal circumstances. Interviewed from Australia, initially a phone screening interview (5 fairly basic iOS questions, understanding blocks and ARC), followed by 2 technical phone interviews (algorithmic coding questions plus verbal conversations around past work experience and also technical iOS questions.After passing in these two phone interviews they flew…  me out to Menlo Park for a day of interviews. There were 5 interviews, one initial chat to warm up, talking about past experience, working relationships, etc, and a brief coding question on the whiteboard.There were 3 more technical interviews of same format as the initial phone interviews. Plus one interview on designing scalable iOS app architecture for a simple app.I really enjoyed the process and found the recruiters very helpful and friendly. Going and visiting Facebook HQ was great and as the reviews say all the people were great. Recommend doing for the experience. Getting an offer is tough. For me it came down to not being quick enough in answering the questions in the onsite technical interviews. They weren't overly difficult but they want you to move fast, and I tended to take my time and discuss with the interviewers which I believe worked against me. The other aspect was a general lack of experience (I have 18 months experience), and this reflected especially in the iOS design interview.Hope this helps others considering going through the process! I definitely recommend it!

Interview was for software engineer. I got the interview call through career fair at campus. It was a telephonic interview for 45 min. The interviewer was very polite and helpful. In the end I messed up things. It started off with the interviewer introducing himself, and asked to introduce my self. Then some behavioral questions, like why Facebook, which team, either Front-end or Back-end are you interested in, and a…  couple of questions on my projects and resume. The interviewed happened on a Thursday. At the end of the interview, the interviewer told "Sorry! Time's-up". Then itself I understood, I would not clear it. Next monday, I got a mail from the recruiter, that they can't move forward.

The hiring cycle is pretty fast. I got the email from recruiter and it took only one day to setup the interview the 1st round interview. After I finished 1st round I emailed the HR for updates and HR get me the result the following day with an arrangement for 2nd round phone interview. And it took about 2 days after 2nd round to know the results. The whole process…  is less than 2 week, pretty sweet :)

Got contacted through LinkedIn. Did an in person interview which went very u well and was invited to California for a full interview loop. I feel the questions they ask are not particularly hard except for the design question (it was called a Pirate interview). In the future would concentrate on that one

I applied online, but didn't get an interview until one of my friends kept bugging the recruiter to give me an interview. After that (which took a long while), had one or two phone interviews, then shortly afterwards flew out to Menlo Park for an on-site interview. The on-site was surprisingly only two rounds of technical interview, then one round of fit interview. The on-site was enjoyable though.

The first round is on-campus interview. The interviewer was very nice. I was asked a lot of questions about binary search tree. It was about basic algorithm and data structure. The second round is on-site interview. It was a tour around their campus. It was a nice experience.

Applied from a career fair. Got an email a month later. They invited me to a social event and an on campus interview. The social event was held in a hotel next to the campus. Students could talk to the interviews in a casual setting, which somehow helps the interview on the next day. The interview was held on campus. The interview lasted for an hour.

Interviewer called from California, talk on the phone and write on colabedit.com. The most important thing for facebook is you never made bugs on simple questions. Also, you need to communicate more with the interviewer to clarify some uncertainty.

Overall interview process was fantastic! Loved it though I did not get the offer.Sourcing Recruiter contacted me on Linkedin when I was not looking. After 6 month or so I contacted same recruiter. I got prompt response from this point till the end.I went through 1st technical round of interview onsite as I was local to their HQ. They prefer onsite though one can choose phone interview. For me onsite…  worked out well.Nearly 1-hour interview with one person. Two programming questions one on link list and other on BST. For each involved finding the solution (easy to optimal) and then write code optimal solution. I did this pretty well as I had prepared for data structures and algos.They immediately called me for full day onsite interview. Again I prepared lot on data structures, algorithms and related problem solving. And boom..that was my mistake. I forgot to focus on system side (locking, synchronization, deadlock) in detail. 5 interviewers, 45 min each. No on asked on data structures/algo. Two interviewers asked on locking related question, 1 design, 1 manager and last guy did combo of everything. Mostly I screwed up on locking related questions as I took many hint and long time... sigh..Everyone was professional. Communication was prompt and fast!

Very technical questions. Be sure to review your data structures, sorting algorithms, and syntax without a reference. They don't care much about syntax, but it might trip you up during whiteboarding. They were extremely friendly, put you up in a hotel and take good care of you during the interview. I think there were many opportunities to ask questions and learn more about the specific problems they're trying to solve.

I had two coding phone interviews but did not move forward to the team matching interview.For each round, a engineer first introduced himself ask a little bit about your experience. Then they go to coding questions directly. I perform good at first round but not that good at second round.

Face to face 45min interview. After briefly asking some questions about your background on your resume, the interviewer gives 1 algorithm problem and 1 follow up regarding to how you solve this problem.Question:Give a dictionary with a huge set of words and a string with wildcard. You are required to find whether there is a match in the dictionary for this given string.

Facebook's interview process is to start you off with a one hour high pressure interview to solve two problems. If you pass that test then you come back for a full day. Facebook is well known for their interview arrogance and it proved to be quite true. The first part was a "white board architecture" problem where "want to see what you are thinking" - which is definitely not true.…  What they want to see is the exact answer/response that they are looking for. The second part is a coding question where you have to write code on a whiteboard using the language of your choice. The interviewer will have asked this question over and over and over again but then act like they are such an expert on the topic. You as the interviewer are going to have to think about it - since you do not have the same luxury as the interviewer. It is a typical facebook, google type interview where they claim to "set the bar high" to make themselves appear like a dream place to work.

First the interviewer introduced himself and ask me questions like why facebook and what do i think are the shortages of facebook. Then we start coding, the same questions in leetcode. After that he said he forgot to ask me about my project experience and I talk about one of my project with him. Last part is the question part.

I applied through career fair at my university. They hosted a pre-interview dinner so you can meet with your recruiter/on-campus interviewer. The next day I had my 45-min interview and it was a pleasant one. The question wasn't that hard and I didn't need any extra hint to solve it.After that they sent me an onsite request (wait for 1 week), then I came to their HQ in MPK a…  week later. Had the interview by noon, then a good tour around campus. The onsite question was much easier, as I think if you're invited to onsite then be confident that you have a really good chance to get in.After 2 business day I got the offer from FB. The compensation is really huge and very hard to decline.As for tip, I would say get as much rest and be well prepared for the interview. They ask basic question but you need to have a clear mind to solve them comfortably, and please try as hard as you can to explain the thought process.

I applied through a referral, 1 Skype interview (2 were scheduled but I didn't make it past the first one). The interviewer briefly introduced himself and asked me a coding question straight away. I chose to use Java. No behavioral questions, just 1 coding question. Contrary to what most people have said, I got an interviewer who wasn't very friendly. He was there to do his job. Plain and simple.

Did not apply. Recruiter approached me via LinkedIn. Gave me 3 weeks to prepare. Later a recent college grad from Whatsapp team approached me for a coding interview. The interview question was simple.

The process took about 2 weeks. Referred by a friend. The interview questions are not hard. I had only phone interview. Firstly, we spoke about my background and my projects. After that I had one coding task - the similar of LeetCode. I managed with it, but not optimal way. And after hint from interviewer I resolved it correctly.I had a positive experience from the interview. But my English level…  is not high and my explanation was awful.

Worst interview I've ever had. The interviewer had a very thick accent, the simple problem was purposely conveyed in the most convoluted way possible, and the phone line they were using was not a great connection. It took me 30 mins, just to understand what she was talking about. Even after that, I still got the problem mostly correct (except for one small error), and then was told it was…  "totally wrong". This indicates that Facebook interviewers are poorly trained, arrogant, and encouraged to needlessly complicate interview problems. Would never interview with them again. But whatever, I would have accepted the offer I got from Google anyway.

I was contacted by a recruiter, I came onsite for an initial screen.I thought the interviewer was very nice, and the question was reasonable. However, the frustrating part for me was that for the given question, there were a few different ways to solve it.From my perspective, it seemed that the approach I used to solve the question was not what the interviewer had in mind. I understand that you…  should listen to an interviewer when they interrupt you or give you hints, but to me it seemed like the "hints" were basically from the perspective of "you're not solving this the way I would solve it, even though both of our solutions are O(n)".The result was that I was basically having to write out a problem on a white board and constantly have my train of thought interrupted. The interruptions were unnecessary, and I had to clarify to the interviewer that my intent would indeed work. Example interruption:Interviewer: "That array index is giving you the same result as the other value"Me: "No, that's a different variable name"Interviewer: "Oh, oops. Continue"orInterviewer: "Wait, why are you replacing the for loop with a while loop?"Me: "Because I want to be able to manipulate the cursor directly"Interviewer: "Oh, ok. Continue"In the above statement, it's clear that the usual method of solving the problem did not involve a while loop (but it could be done to solve the problem). After my solution, the interviewer explained the most straightforward solution to the problem which basically leveraged the constraints of the problem itself, and after seeing that then of course the problem was trivial to implement.So to me, it seemed like the question was more of a riddle than a coding exercise, which I believe to be a bad interview question, and at my current company it's accepted as the WORST type of interview question.It was rather embarrassing for me to be turned down, especially on just the initial screen, but another qualm I had was that screens are generally meant to filter out candidates that can't code at all, not candidates who are questionable in their skills (from my perspective my skills aren't questionable, but clearly I did not give my best performance in this screen).To me it felt as though the interviewer in this case did not have much experience. While I was answering the questions that were given to me, I was having to explain a few quirks to the python language that the interviewer clearly did not know i.e. "Oh, I didn't know you could compare dictionaries like that". For that to be said, I can only infer that the ONLY thing this interviewer was looking for is if I answer the question that was given to me in the exact way they wanted it solved.

I was interviewed by a technical person who is working on my interest area. And after some basic information emails, I was appointmented at a Thursday. They are using some web coding pages, then I joined that chat, the interviewer showed me a problem of coding. That problem was about tree, I didn't have much experience on trees so I asked him to change for some other questions. Finally I…  got an array question, but I didn't answer it wisely. Thus I got the rejection just the next day, their response time is really short.

Was called onsite directly as I was local to Cambridge, MA.A Sr. Engineer interviewed. He was welcoming and willing to help.It was a typical white board coding interview.Very professional and very helpful.Recruiter called and asked me to come onsite as the position was local.They gave responses very quick.I said to my interviewer that I am not interested in web development but interested in back end (may be its a mistake,…  as its facebook).

Interview process is well-organized and conveyed professionally. Be ready to be surprised by questions. Do your homework. For software engineers, try to dig a bit into how they do stuff at Facebook. There will be very specific questions they gonna ask.

I was contacted by email by two recrutiers, they were very nice and atentive giving material to help with my doubts. It would be 2 or 3 rounds of phone interviews before the result, but I was out in the first. My interviwer was pretty cool, nice and really sincere.

I applied through an internal referral. The process took about one week. A recruiter contacted me via email. At the interview, an engineer called me via phone. He was in bad mood. He asked me Why Facebook and was not satisfied with my answer at all. He interrupted me a lot during the whole interview.

Facebook recruiter got in touch with me. Had a phone conversation with her. She setup a phone screen within a week. Used Collabedit for coding. Two questions. Got a reply back within a week. Setup on site for the next week. 1 behavioral, lunch, 2 coding, 1 system design. The questions I got were weren't super difficult except for the system design question (how will you design the social graph…  with class, interfaces, etc). Other questions were, implement Pow, convert from decimal to roman and vice versa, binary tree serialization and deserialization, implement concurrent read/write buffer. For the system design question, the interviewer was very helpful and provided hints when I got stuck.

Reached out to by recruiter, had phone chat with her. She set up two technical phone screens, followed by 4 technical onsite interviews. Had a chance to talk to some really experienced engineers and everyone was really friendly during the interview process.

Applied through university career fair. Received a call within a week, and scheduled an interview a week later. Was asked a question on graphs. The interview experience was pleasant. The interviewer gave me time to think. The interview went on for 45 minutes. The process was smooth. Received a reject email a week later.

Contacted a technical recruiter who helped set up a technical phone interview with an engineer. The phone interview last 45 minutes with a typical algorithm optimization problem. The engineer works with me to come up with a better version of my brute-force solution which was great and the whole process was very educational as well.

They called me via Skype, we had a normal conversation about my interest and they asked me about my knowledge for the projects that Facebook are working on. Then they give me the oportunity to ask anything about Facebook.

Firstly, I applied for FB position online and then an HR contacted me to appoint a time to chat.The chat with HR including:1. What the basic interview process.2. What the basic hiring process if get offer3. Free chat to understand my backgroundThen one day later I received mail to determine a skype screen date.The interview through skype1. firstly self introduction and ice breaker.2. 2 coding execisesThe execises is similar with…  that in leetcode that of easy/medium level

HR was pretty fast to arrange phone screenings and on-site interviews. Pretty nice atmosphere in FB and people seemed to enjoy FB life. 4 sessions of interviews during on-site. Most about algorithm and system design

Got back to hear within a day of onsite interview. They flew me to Menlo Park. The interviewer was late to the interview and was unprepared. He asked me a linked list question (reverse a linked list) and then he asked me to print out level order tree.

Applied through an employee referral.Failed on a phone screening. The interviewer spoke extremely fast. In addition, there was a strong reverberation (looks like she spoke in a big room) on a line. As a result, I mostly guessed her questions. Even when I asked to repeat a question a few times she didn't change anything in her speech. I've had phone interviews before and they were good enough. But this…  one was a hell.Besides a few usual questions about previous experience and a reason for changing a job, there were only 2 technical questions, both about complexity of algorithms (O-notations), i.e. quite useless, in other words. I think I answered them correctly (Anyway it makes no sense to remember them).It took about 20 minutes. Overall, it was terrible experience. The worst thing, I failed it not due to lack of some technical skills but just because of communication issues. I have a lot of Java experience (they had open positions for that) and some other modern tools and technologies, as well as I'm opened for learning new technologies. But, unfortunately, I haven't had any chance to demonstrate it on any technical phone interviews.Never again.

Got contacted by a recruiter through Linkedin. Told him I'm not currently looking for a job, but since Facebook seems like a great opportunity, I'll interview. The interview had a rather easy question, but I had a problem quickly writing code on the whiteboard - something that I've hard ever done in my programming career. Nor do I have a lot of interview experience in the US. Which I did…  warn them about. Still got a reply later saying I failed because of "coding performance". Whatever that means. As if they are looking for professional interviewees rather that computer programmers. Whole process felt like a waste of time.

I was contacted by a recruiter via email and had a phone chat with him.The recruiting team sent the interview confirmation email to my other email ID which I've not shared anywhere. When I was wondering where they got that email ID from I realized I had a Facebook dummy account with different name and that email ID associated with. It's creepy how the recruiter had that email address when…  Facebook assures us that recruiters are not given access to that kind of internal data. Anyway, I missed the interview because of this and when I contacted the recruiter, he said they had a different email address in their records and didn't schedule another one and never responded to my emails. Overall, in my opinion, they were very unprofessional and creepy.

I applied online and heard back the next day. They gave me study material and resources to prepare for a phone interview.The phone interview is tough. The level of difficulty is not bad but the pressure of being on the phone and having to code in a short period of time may cloud your mind.

I was contacted by Facebook recruiter. The entire process was efficient and quick. After the initial phone call with the recruiter, I received an email with details about interview process and how to prepare for technical interview in general, which I think it was pretty nice. I was scheduled for the phone interview one week after. The phone interview includes behavior questions and online coding and it took about 45…  minutes. It started with typical introduction and then I was asked to talk about one of the works/projects listed on my resume and why I would pick to talk about that particular one. The interviewer didn't seem to impress about the project I picked to talk about. There were a couple of behavior questions (i.e. conflict resolution etc). Then the longest part of the phone interview was a coding question. You can pick any language you'd like, which is a plus. The coding question was not difficult, but clearly not an easy one, requires some thoughts. Be prepared to provide test cases. I had it working but not covering many edge cases. At the end, you can ask the interviewer any question, which I did. It sounded like the interviewer didn't seem to be excited about the current work, but kind enough to give me details about the challenging parts and current interesting problems the interviewer has been working on. I heard back the interview result from the recruiter exactly one week after.

Applied through referral. 45 minutes telephone interview. The interviewer was very nice. She guided me through the interview process and gave me 5 minutes to ask any questions. Two coding questions which are easy. One question is about Trie and the other is about binary search.

The interviewer was very cool and he asked me about myself and my projects. He also asked why I want to choose facebook and then we started coding round, which took nearly 45 minutes.He mainly focused on performance tuning of algorithms.i.e How fast we can make spontaneous decisions for an algorithm to run fast.Overall, it was very good experience.

It was an on-campus interview, and was in a small room that was super hot and hard to concentrate in. My interviewer was not too helpful and would barely help me while I was struggling. Based on other interviews with tech companies, I felt like FB engineers could use a little more improvement in the way that they assist candidates.

I was referred to Facebook by a friend who works there and was contacted by a member of HR about a week later. We set up a date for a 45-minute technical phone interview which was to be held a week and a half later.For the actual interview, I was first asked a couple of generic questions about myself and Facebook before moving on to the technical questions. There were…  two programming questions.For the first question, I first described what my algorithm would be, then discussed time and space complexity before finally implementing it. My interviewer didn't have anything to say about my answer and we simply moved on.I took the same basic approach to the second question; described my algorithm, discussed space/time complexity, and then implemented it. However, after discussing the space and time complexity for my potential solution, my interviewer asked me if I saw any draw-backs to my algorithm. I told him that it used a lot of extra space, and he asked if I could think of a more efficient (space-wise) solution. I thought about it for awhile, but unfortunately blanked out. He then suggested I just go ahead and implement my algorithm.The last 5 or so minutes of the 45 minute interview were devoted to me asking questions. I asked a few, and the interview was over.I received a generic rejection email 3 days later.

I applied to the summer internship last year. However, I didn't hear anything until June. They said they were going to interview me for full time position. Then I told them I won't be graduating until this year summer. So, I postpone the interview to this year. They they got confused that I was applying to the summer internship this year. After a phone interview, they sent me onsite interview.…  The onsite interview was postponed for almost an hour without notice. I was waiting there for almost an hour. So, things were really rush.

Two technical phone screen interviews and afterwards and invite to the Facebook University Day at a campus of my choice (Menlo Park, Seattle or NYC) - all expenses paid. On campus I had a final technical interview with one of the developers. The rest of the day was spent getting to know the campus and some of the newly hired developers as well as a Q&A with a senior developer.

Submitted resume through college career board. Have a phone interview. The decision was made within a week after the phone interview. The interviewer was nice. He went over my resume and asked couple related question. The questions ranges from hardware related protocol to generic software engineering questions.

the hiring process was extremely efficient. they move as fast as you need.i got responses from the recruiter in minutes and two hours after the interview i got the results.the office looks nice and the people there also.it looked too young to my taste. didn't see there anyone older (over 45) with experience but this was only a quick look.i got a problem that i can solve in 20 min…  with my laptop, but wen you need to code it on a whiteboard it's a different skill i don't have.even though your concept is right - they look for potential bugs on your code so make sure you write carefully (i don't).

First had a 1 hour phone interview with a Facebook employee. Two days later, I was invited to a 45min on campus interview in California. I heard back 2 weeks after the final interview.

I got the opportunity through internal referral.I passed an technical phone screening and was invited to an on-site. I had 5 interviews in total. Two coding, two system design, one with manager (on PhD research + a quick coding exercise).The technical questions were not too difficult, but I was unprepared for the system design problems. One of the interviewers kept walking around in the room and was really distracting and…  annoying. I couldn't focus on solving the problem and didn't do well in that session.The interviewing schedule was not the best. I was scheduled to have lunch at 2pm PST, but considering I'm from a couple time zones east of PST, I was already way too hungry to have lunch at that time. Perhaps a low blood sugar level also contributed to my impaired thinking abilities.

Met Facebook engineers who referred me to the recruiter. The recruiter contacted me three weeks after I met the engineers. Set up round 1 phone screen within the next 2 weeks of our first email exchange. Facebook does move pretty fast with the recruiting process. The recruiter contacted me again about 2 days after round 1 interview to set up round 2. Round 2 was about 3 weeks after round…  1.

Got an email from a recruiter a couple weeks after they came to our school for a college tour. Had an interview with one of the software engineers and he asked behavioral questions and then a technical question.

4 rounds onsite interviews. Not very difficult, need bug free. 45 mins each round, 5 mins break between them. People there are smart and nice. some resume questions, 1 to 2 coding problems each round

I applied through a conferene, then i received an email from facebook, we schedule an interview depending on my availability, the interview was on the phone and call that lasted around 45 minutes

1. I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter on LinkedIn.2. She arranged a coding phone screen. It was about an hour long, and assessed programming & algorithmic problem solving skills.3. After I passed the phone screen, I was invited to an onsite interview, which was about 6 hours long. Each session lasted about 45 minutes. Five sessions involved programming questions on dynamic programming, data structures, system design, algorithmic complexity. One…  session was almost purely behavioral, even though I was applying for a software engineering position.

Implement an asked simple function in an empty paper. Each type of variables (ex. int, double) and using conditional / iterative statement had to be chosen carefully to avoid a single mistake.Then typical personal questions came after the code interview.

phone interview. ask one project, and why want to work in facebook. Then ask two coding question. The first one is implement strstr(), and follow up is how to speed it up. The second question is 3 sum, and the element can be duplicated. Follow up is how to speed it up.

I was referred by a friend.Whole process took a week in a half - due to a pending deadline on my part.I had a phone interview and was then invited onsite at the end of the week. The onsite interview was composed of 3 interviews. They were typical questions of any other technical interview questions - although slightly more tree-heavy than other companies.On Monday I was contacted asking to provide…  references. I thought I had it in the bag because of this but Tuesday evening I was rejected.I know that they were strong and wouldn't cause my rejection. So I guess references are asked for before the onsite interviews are processed?

The whole process was very fast.I have applied through the web site and got reply on a same day.1. Screening with recruiter (15-20 mins)2. Phone interview with an engineer (45 mins)3. Onsite interview with 4 people (2 coding, 1 system design, 1 culture fit + coding)

Facebook had come on campus.The first round was simple coding questions .The second round was a telephonic screening for 45 mins. The interviewer explained his job role and gave 5 mins in the end to ask questions

1 Behavior/Past experience2 Ninja3 Lunch (not rated)4 Design5 NinjaThe behavior interview is about 1 hour, just talking about your past and current experience and projects you have done, plus a 15 mins coding test.first Ninja is an opening question, essentially creating your own question based on a scenario and do some coding. My experience was really good so you have the flexibility to design questions you are familiar with.Lunch was…  chat with a senior team lead, relax and get to know what you want to know.Design was easy for me, since I have done a similar system at my current job.the last ninja really sucked, the question is about a really unconventional event processing model using "pulling" instead of standard "push" model (like Storm), and the interviewer does not talk much and was not happy when I proposed the much simpler and intuitive push model. I failed on this one.

got on-campus interview and I got a problem JUMP || in leetcode and I got onsite interview chance.I have four interview with software engineer. The most difficult thing is system design. they asked problem which can be solved by disjoint set problem.they asked a dynamic programming stuff, array, binary tree.

Did three rounds of interviews.First round: design a system to detect homeworking copying, which means input two strings and a integer K, if there is a common substring of them have length larger than K, return true, else return false.Second round: nearly all behavior questions. In the last five minutes, asked me to code up a linked list reverse functionThird round: build a dictionary trie and implement search function, mainly…  focusing on the OO designing pattern.

Contacted Facebook University recruiter with my CV and sent in a form specifying where I wanted to work/ what I wanted to do at Facebook. I was scheduled an interview for late in the evening due to the time difference with California. Initially asked a number of questions on my CV and the projects I had worked on. Then moved onto technical coding question using online coding tool. This was…  a hard recursive question which I was unable to complete.

One on campus interview and one onsite interview. The on campus interview takes 45 minutes, the interviewer will ask first about the resume and project experience and then the ask one or two technical problems. If pass the on campus interview. There will be notification for an onsite interview after one or two business day.

First round - Interview on campus. 45 minutes long. Half of the interview is your typical questions about your resume, what you know about the company, what you do. 2nd half is a coding question given by the interviewer.2nd round - Pick your choice of location and do an interview there. I chose Menlo Park. Day consists of 4 interviews in the morning and a tour & culture overview in…  the afternoon. Of the 4 interviews 2 were almost purely coding questions. 1 was half and half. 1 was purely behavioral. Each interview lasts 45-50 minutes each.

I applied through campus. It took 2 weeks. First there's a on-campus interview for 45 mins. After that, I was noticed to take the on-site interview. For on-site, there're 3 rounds, 2 of them are all coding, the other is behavior questions plus 1 15-mins coding.

First I got a phone interview, where I was asked a few background questions like previous experience. After this, I received an email for an on-site interview. After a brief tour of the campus in Palo Alto, I was brought to a room where a Senior Software Engineer interviewed me. I was asked a number of simple questions, and then one complex coding question.

A phone interview, simply ask some question about resume and then ask coding question. They sent a link to you and use the link to coding. Just one question, the question is typed by them in the link.

Referred by a friend.The recruiter responds quickly. First the recruiter needs to know more about me and introduces the job. Then planned a phone screen for me. One coding question. Two days later I was informed I am invited for a full loop. The onsite includes four rounds. Two Coding, one system design and one Jedi. Great experience

I met the recruiter at a career fair. He was really helpful and scheduled me for an interview within the same week. I had a phone interview with one of the software engineers and was asked to code three technical problems. The first one was a list of anagrams and the other two were related to levelorder traversal of binary trees.

straight-foward coding and design. 2 coding interview, 1 system design interview, and 1 hiring manager interview. recruiter is very helpful. it's a very nice experience. interviewer are helpful and kind. Everybody is very friendly.

A friend referred me and then I got contacted by a recruiter sometime during September. Arranged for a phone interview two weeks later, and two hours after my phone interview, I was told that I could go onsite.During onsite there are 4 rounds of interviews. 3 are completely coding, the other is half behavior and half coding. Most questions are not hard and can be found on Glassdoor or other…  sort of programming interview preparing materials. Definitely easier than Google interview questions.I thought I did pretty well during the onsite (better than phone). Answered all but one question they asked me, and I did not think there was a lot of bugs. No idea why I did not get in, but since I am really not even half of a world-class developer, at this stage I understand luck is more involved than skills.

Contacted by recruiter via LinkedIn. Phone interview set up one week after contact.Interviewer contacts you on day of interview and send you a link for an online document editor.Interview lasted 45 mins.The interviewer started off by asking me what my most interesting project is that I have worked on. This took less than 5 mins.Then the interviewer gives you the rest of the time to solve a programming problem.The last…  5 mins or the remaining time you can ask the interviewer questions.The question was fair. Not a brain teaser. Interviewer was very nice and helpful.

I contacted with FB on a campus recruiting event and then was initially given an on campus interview. After that, I was asked to have an onsite interview with them in one of the three locations: New York city, Seattle or Menlo Park. I chose to visit the Seattle office. The process for onsite interview is inviting and I had a good time on that day. It was a university…  day, on which that FB invites all the university students to interview with them on the same day. The interview was one day long, starting with breakfast and then followed by three rounds of technical interview. Then entire afternoon was just visiting the office.

I applied online, and then received email to arrange a first round phone interview, the engineer was nice and the question was easy, but it was my first interview, so I was a little nervous, two questions in 45 minutes:1. Find intersection of 2 sorted arrays.2. Move all non-zero elements into the front of array.

Met the recruiters at the university carer fair and got a call a week after that. Had my interview on campus within that week. Got back my results 2 weeks later. The overall process took less than 3 weeks. The interviewers are friendly and will give hints in between to keep you getting closer to solution. This was a 1 on 1 interview and coding had to done on white…  paper. The questions are straight forward but need to take into consideration all corner cases when giving your algorithm. Also the code needs to be clean, so think carefully before starting to just code. Also practice writing code on white paper as when you are doing it you tend to scratch out code in between and that reflects bad.

I had one interview on campus and then after 1 week I had onsite call.I went to headquater Menlo Park for onsite. At oniste I had 5 interviews 1:1.Interviewer were very friendly.Just an advice always try to go to headquater for any company onsite interview.

1 phone interview and 3 on-site interview. Phone interview was a pure coding question. One of the on-site interview wasn't good, during which the interviewer kept looking at his phone

Applied online, recruiter reached out to me and set up a phone interview. The interviewer over the phone was slightly ambiguous and lead me in the wrong directions. However, I think the goal was to really analyze your thinking process.

Got interview through recruiter.Had a phone screening soon after, and then was told that I was being considered for an initial technical phone interview.Question: Something about 2D arrays.I felt like I was a bit slow, although I did finish the interview with about 20 minutes left over. (Was originally given 45 minutes)

I went for a networking event and gave the recruiter my resume. She contacted me shortly to set up an interview. I had a tech screen which was onsite since I have an office in my city. On clearing that I had 3 more on-site interviews. After that I was asked to solve a take home puzzle.

I was contacted from a recruiter through Linkedin. I reply with my updated resume and the times for a phone call. The recruiter call me back the same week and ask about general background and some JavaScript questions, maybe because I commented about wanted to work in UI. The call took about 30 min. Two days later I received an email with a code challenge. After I delivered the challenge,…  two days later I got an email about not moving forward in my interview process.In general the recruiter was super helpful with all the questions that I had.

Applied online. Got an email from a recruiter. Easy,efficient and painless process. The recruiters are really quick and will let you know the smallest of details regarding the interview.Had a technical phone screen with an engineer from a similar team. Had to code on collabedit. Was initially asked some OOP concepts,Data structure questions.The coding question was easy and i solved it correctly albeit a few corrections here and there. The…  code ran in O(n) with no space so i thought i did good. Question was find if one string is one edit distance away from the other string. This is the same as minimum edit distance question but with a twist. In this case you just want to know if its one edit away or not. The interviewer asked me if there was anything i could improve in the code, at that moment i did not think there could be any improvement other than some validation checks/readability of code. After the call i realized there was a small 5 line solution to this involving recursion but alas.

Met at career fair and talked with a recruiter. Received an email to do an onsite interview. Within a couple days of the interview I was asked to attend a Campus day (on site) and was given a couple of possible dates. FB arranged flights and hotels (really really nice hotels) for the visit. Offers were extended within a week of the interview

Was contacted by a recruiter on Linkedin. He set up a call with the relevant FB department.I was not looking actively for a job, so was little under prepared. The interviewer was nice and came across as a knowledgeable hands-on person. Provided a shared hackpad to do the white boarding process.

I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter, and offered an interview for a Software Engineer Internship. I had two interviews, both a combination of talking on the phone and coding on collabedit.com. The first interview took place about five days after I was first contacted about the position; the interviewer asked a few questions about projects I'd done and then started with programming questions. The second interview happened a week…  later, and the interviewer dove straight into coding problems. I was asked general algorithm questions, like get the n-th Fibonacci number, find the square root of a number, find the depth of a binary tree, merge two arrays, etc. Both interviewers saved time at the end for any questions I wanted to ask them.

I was hiring specifically for an iOS position. The recruiters start with Obj-C 5 multiple choice questions, which required some surprising depth. I won't get into specifics, but take time to understand memory management (even with arc), blocks, addresses and pointers.After was a phone interview which mostly involved a collaborative coding question. The questions asked here were very typical algorithmic questions, the answers usually involved a hash to cache meta…  values to increase performance.Protip: Be familiar with NSSet and NSOrderedSet. These data structures are more performant than NSArrays for some operations, and I found myself using them in almost every answer.Then you have an onsite visit, with 4 additional interviews: 2 coding, 1 design, and 1 "culture fit" which, for me, was really another coding interview.Your recruiter will contact during the next week or two afterwards to give you updates on your status. I believe there are three different meetings where your interviewing notes are reviewed and given consideration.

I did not go beyond the first screening interview. Though I did not make it, but I thoroughly enjoyed the interview as the interviewer was interacting and helping me solve the problems and having discussion about the problem

Was contacted by a university recruiter after submitting my resume 9 months prior. I was given a two week period to prepare and complete a on the phone interview with an engineer at Facebook. Was asked limited personal information, and then prompted with a technical problem on an online collaborative document drafting site.

Introduced into the whole process via a referral, so I was able to move quickly to an onsite interview. This was easily the best interview experience I've had in a long time - recruiter was friendly and extremely responsive, and each of the interviews was engaged during the interview.Everything moved very quickly once I indicated that I felt prepared to interview.

I received an email from the recruiter regarding a software engineer position. I said I was interested in knowing about this position. We set up some time to talk about it on the phone. She then explained me the role and the interview process. I scheduled the phone screen to begin the process. My interview went good in general however I was not selected for further rounds.

I was contacted by the recruiter through linkedin. I had an initial call with the recruiter where I was asked about my interests and what I might be looking for. Recruiter explained me the entire process on how the interview goes. Usually they have an initial phone interview, where you have to write code through collabedit. After that in person interview.Phone interview was all about data structures. First the interviewer…  asked me what interests me about facebook, what is one thing about facebook I like. After that interviewer asked me to print a binary tree in level order. I did that. And then I was asked to print the tree in level order but using DFS. Interviewer was nice, was giving a lot of hints whenever I was stuck. Overall, a good experience.

One/two phone interviews and one onsite. Contacted by recruiter, setup the time for a phone screen. Fairly well managed setup. Interview called on time, and was very nice to work with.

A recruiter set up a short chat and ask some behaviour questions, and bad things happen. She ask me some cliche questions like "why facebook" and I give my answer by talking about the technology fb using, which she didn't understand. I guess she expect me to be a fan of social network but my topic is always technology. Finally she ask if I am talking with other company. I…  give her a name of a company. But she never heard that. Hey, that's a middle size company in bay area just ipo 2yrs ago. She just can't understand what I am talking in the phone call. Not even one. Got rejection few days later.

Was contacted via email about a position that I would be a good fit for.I replied stating I was very interested and excited about the opportunity to work for Facebook However, I never received a follow up phone screen nor was I given a response to my email.

This was for a position in their Infrastructure team in Cambridge MA.Recruiter contacted me in September and was very interested in my background and experience with highly scalable systems - both in Finance and Mobile phone payments.I attended some small intimate presentations they did as they were initially opening a new Boston office and wanted to grow it out. The meetings were great and I learned a lot about how…  they solve some of their biggest problems.I then did a screening interview on-site (because I don't do technical screens well on the phone). The question was "Given a binary tree, write code to print the tree out line by line". I did OK and got the Breadth First Search down fine, but couldn't figure out the - line-by-line part. (Turns out this is Facebook's #1 question to ask in interviews).Although my performance wasn't great they gave me a break on that and asked me back for another screening interview. This time I prepared well for another coding interview but it turned out to be a Design interview. The problem was"Imagine you have 10,000 servers and need to monitor the performance of each one, how would you do it" - naturally you need to be able to NOT take too much of the bandwidth and so you'll have to do sampling, have some history to watch for trends etc.I passed that and was very excited to be flown out to Menlo Park for the final round.I studied like CRAZY based on questions on this site and CareerCup. I took 4 weeks and studied about 15 hours per week.Turns out I focused on the wrong questions - I studied Tree, String, Array and List algorithms based on the distribution of Q&A but I was asked Binary math and heap algorithms. Here are the questions I was asked.1) How would you implement division without +, - or multiplication (a "classic" question, but not one of the ones I would focus on). I bombed on this as I was not expecting and could not recall my binary math. I figured out the high level outline but that was all. That I was asked this in the "culture fit" interview made this doubly unexpected.2) Given 10,000 servers containing a Billion integers each how would you find how to find the median? I knew the answer to this question (use two heaps) - not because I had focused on it, but I had found it an interesting question while studying. However he then asked "How much memory do you need?" and I didn't know how big the heaps would need to be. The real answer I was trying to get is - what is the minimum heap you need. I had a guess but I think I got this wrong.3) Given a List structure where each node contains a Next node and optionally a pointer to another list, flatten that liste.g.L1 --> L2 --> L3 --> L7 --> L8                      |                      v                     L4 --> L5-->L6WIll be flattened toL1 --> L2 --> L3 -->L4 -->L5-->L6-->L7-->L8I did OK on this - getting the answer - but it appeared I took too long. The interviewer also interrupted me a lot while I was writing an initial solution and that threw me off - I like to be more iterative in my problem solving but I think he expected 100% immediate correctness.He had an observer there too and that guy looked bored out of his mind and that bugged me a little too as it wasn't clear who would be doing the judging.4) I was also handed some hard to read Python code (I don't know Python) and asked to figure out what it does. I did OK on this - but again surprised to be handed hard-to-read code in a language I didn't know.5) One final question "How would you implement the "ls" Unix function in your language of choice. It should take the input:>ls a/b/c/*/e/*/f/*/*/gand the output should be similar the the output given by unix."I used a tree structure to represent the file directory structure and wrote a solution from there. I did OK on this.Overall: Everyone seemed very nice - I had a nice lunch and the campus is interesting but it was clear that what I studied was not what I needed to (so lesson learned: don't just trust the distribution of questions on Glassdoor or CareerCup). I even got to walk past Zuckerberg's office (more of a conference room) and saw Sheryl Sandberg in there.One interesting thing I learned is a lot of Google people are leaving for Facebook. Also I'd say if you are over 30 (I am 41) you are a rare bird at Facebook :-)I knew based on the reactions of the interviewers that it was very probably a bust, but overall a good experience and something I will learn from. Very disappointing as I really wanted to be one of the first few Facebook engineers in the Boston area - and to work on their super high scalability issues but such is Life.

FB is very efficient in hiring. The HR first sent some regular questions for me to answer, including the time to start working and so on, and then arranged the phone interview directly. On the same day of my phone interview, she arranged for onsite interviews. I was impressed with how efficient they are.

A recruiter reached out to me, but I didn't start the phone screen until four weeks later as I wasn't fully prepared. After I passed the phone screen, I was invited to onsite interview the next day. I went to their office two weeks later. After three week I was told that I didn't pass as I didn't do well in the system design round. The recruiter said as I…  had three years experience, so the position was a senior position, so the system design interview was really critical.

I applied online and was contacted by the recruiter and send me an invitation to solve the programming puzzle online. After it, I received the mail from recruiter and set up a technical phone interview.

The recruiter was excellent and quickly scheduled the first interview, but the manager seemed too busy and unprepared for the interview. When asked about development processes, make sure you show how flexible you are. They aren't looking for candidates who follow a strict SDLC; they want someone who can deal with less structure.

Recruiter contacted me from LinkedIn profile and got me first round of interviews in NYC office

Two interviews - one on my university campus, one on the nearest Facebook campus. Got back promptly after the second interview. The culture is amazingly open, any intern can look at any piece of code in the company - nothing is secret. Additionally a lot of trust is put in interns and employees.

Was referred by an employee working at Facebook. Was paired with a HR guy who facilitated the process via email. Did a phone interview with an engineer about a week after first contact. Did the technical interview and was told I would get a decision within the week. Didn't get a response after trying to follow up so I took it as a no.

three phone interviews. 2 technical, 1 team matching. three phone interviews. 2 technical, 1 team matching.three phone interviews. 2 technical, 1 team matching.three phone interviews. 2 technical, 1 team matching.

After uploading my resume and solving the puzzle I had requested, I got contacted by a recruiter through email. After two weeks, the recruiter interviewed me over the phone to learn about my interests.Then, in about two weeks, I had my phone interview. I was asked a question on comparing two general tree data structured. I answered the question and wrote the code correctly in the given space/time constraints.A week…  later I was contacted again and invited for on-site interview. However, the timing was not good and they said given my status (that I need an H1B), and current cap, they cannot move forward with the interview.The whole experience was smooth and exciting. I was just not quite lucky with the timeline.

1 phone interview : merge sorted list, maximum path in tree3 round onsite : Regular expression, strStr, anagram, split sentence into words, talk about projects1 extra phone interview after onsite : talk about projects, count and sayAll the questions can be found in leetcode

Went onsite for the interview. I was asked regex matching. The recruiters were pretty nice. The interviewer was grim and did not give any reaction. I thought I did well but didn't get the job.

I was contacted by a recruiter in early 2014. I was set up with an engineer for a phone interview. The first few questions were about my resume, simple stuff about projects I've worked on and prior experience. Then I was asked two technical questions, one about recursion and one about trees. I fully solved and optimized the tree problem but struggled a bit with the recursive problem. Overall it…  wasn't too difficult but make sure you prepare well before going in!

First round interview, 45 mins long

Was contacted by a recruiter. Set up a phone interview; had weird telephone problems, couldn't understand my interviewer very well. Did some general algorithm questions in Python that were well-suited to a phone interview, but wasn't pleased with my performance overall.Recruiter contacted me back to do a second phone screen - said there "wasn't enough of a signal" the first time. Apparently this is not common. Second phone screen had…  problems with the collaborative edit software we used for coding - I had to stop, copy, and repaste my code several times for some reason. Again, the questions were well-suited to the format of the interview. Thought I did better but no better than an average performance, probably.No offer, the whole process took about a month (but I intentionally delayed the phone screen for personal reasons).

I got the interview by applying at campus career fair. Got an on campus interview very soon after and then a phone interview, which I did not pass. The on campus interview was more about coding skills and your interest, while the phone interview contains more about personality test.

A 45 minutes phone interview as expected. They asked several questions about the background. Talk something about yourself, your project, your interests. And then moved forward to the code interview on Collabedit. The question is the simple 3 sum and pow(). At the end, they asked whether you have some questions about facebook.

I knew based on the reactions of the interviewers that it was very probably a bust, but overall a good experience and something I will learn from. Very disappointing in the LA area - and to work on their super high scalability issues but such is Life.

Was contacted by recruiter in LinkedIn and started interview process. He was transparent, prompt and supporting during the process. He updated me every on every step and details and he was prompt: getting feedback after 3 hours from phone interview speaks for itself. Then I had on-site interview, three interviewer liked my answers, system design really like my design and thinking, but apparently one of the interviewer didn't like my…  coding style and I was asked to come for one more interview just to check the coding part again. So tip: use whiteboard better, apparently working and clean code is not enough it needs to look clean on board as well :) Overall process was positive. But, I had a feeling that some interviewers are really un-experienced and focus on wrong things. Also big difference from other companies: they expect you to be really fast (read - you need to know answer upfront). If you don't know answer upfront, but come up with solution after thinking, trying, making misatkes and optimizing - it doesn't count, at least it didn't in my case. Try to solve my problem below (if you don't know answer already), implement, test it on board in 15-20 minutes.Advice for FB: train your interviewers to focus on skills, NOT memorized skills.I have offer from big companies/competitors, so I will just go with them.

It was an on-campus interview in CMU. I went to one of the job affairs of the university, and received an email about the interview within a week.Facebook also held a candidate reception in one of the plazas near CMU campus. We got the chance to know our interviewers in advance to ask any questions.

They asked me to code on Collabedit. The first question was finding the largest drop in a an array. The second question was implementing a regex matching function. My interview was not bad, but overall, I am not pleased with the hiring process in Facebook. The interviewer was ignorant in my expert field.

The interview process for me was uberly long. I wasn't planning on applying to Facebook, but a recruiter reached out to me mid-december on LinkedIn. I thought "what the heck, it's a great company" and got back to her the next day, but she was leaving for the XMas break. No more communication until early Jan. Connecting on the phone was a pain, as first she didn't call until 15…  minutes after she said she would. I had stopped standing by the phone and went to email her when she did call, so missed it. We emailed and set something up for an hour later. This time she called 30 minutes late. No apologies or anything. Sigh. She advised that I put all of my other interviews before the Facebook one so that I could get practice, and then signed me up for a free interview review course they run. I went and things were all great, so I told them I was ready. Queue another 2 week pause while they tried to answer a question I had asked before scheduling me. When I finally made it onsite for an interview (mid-late feb), I had expected it to be a full day of interviewing, but instead it was a 30 minute screen before I could do the *actual* interview. In all fairness, I should have seen that coming. But anyways, did the screen and got a response before I had even left the parking that they wanted to schedule my full interview. I also got a call from my recruiter that afternoon to give me interview feedback. I thought that was awesome, as most people don't do that. I can't say how useful it was as I had no negative feedback from my interviewers and her advice was just "wow, keep doing whatever you just did!" but it sounds like it could be useful if things don't go perfectly the first time around. Anywho, by this time I had multiple other offers with deadlines on them. I went ahead and scheduled the final round interview for the following week, but ended up canceling the day before as I had decided to go with another company. This seemed to irk my recruiter, despite the fact that she was the one who told me to interview with other companies first and I had been upfront about that and the associated timelines during the whole process. When initial contact and end offer are 2.5 months apart, you can't expect someone to be sitting idle that whole time...The only reason I still rank this as a positive experience is because I had a secondary recruiter I worked with coordinating onsite logistics (the girl who first contacted me was out of state) and he was awesome. If any of you get the chance, work with Charlie. He's direct and super straight forward and knows that candidates are people with multiple options and treats you as such. I do a lot of mentoring and will certainly be sending any of my mentees who expresses interest in Fbook Charlie's way; he's a real gem.

A on-campus interview lasting about 35 mins. The interviewer is a man with red nail and red hair. Just asked some background questions at first and then start asking the technique questions. It is not a difficult one.

very friendly hiring and interview. The recruiter settled for a telephone interview. I said my English was not good and they allowed me to change it into a face to face interview at the campus.and then I passed the telephone interview but failed the onsite.

campus recruiting and campus interview. I submit my resume in career fair and get notification of interview on the next day. The interviewer first asked me some questions on my resume and then asked me a technical question

After I talked through phone with recruiter, I got interview for coding question. The coding question is easy, just use recursion to solve it. But time is quite tight, I could not finish the code in time as I talked too much with the interviewers.

The whole process took around 6 weeks. I did my first phone screen in beginning of January and had my onsite in February. Involved algorithm and design problems. Not too hard.

Overall the process is very fast and all the interviewers are very nice.It take 3 weeks to finish all the interviews (include christmas and new year holidays).I took 1 phone screen + 2 coding + 1 system design + 1 research interview( for PHD ).All the coding questions are the common questions you could meet them easily when you read " crack the coding interview" or surf GeeksforGeeks.com, and there…  was no brainteaser.The system design problem is kind of hard, because there are no right or wrong answers. I think I didn't perform that well in this round, because I am not very experienced in large system design.The research interview mainly focus on my research project, and we also had a small coding part, I did well on that.Honestly, I am kind of surprise that I did not get offer from Facebook, maybe there were some requirements that I did not match.

Phone interview and then on site. In the phone interview, they ask me to solve the 3 sum problem (check leetcode) and the bucket anagram problem. In the on site interview, 3 interviewers ask me three algorithm problems and also the behavior problems. Then there's a brief tour to the campus.

Fairly standard. 4 technical rounds and 1 phone interview in a period of 2-3 weeks. NDA got my hands tied.

Solved their online puzzle, got contacted by campus recruiter, scheduled phone interview, went on-site for 2nd round interview.

I was first contacted by a recruiter at Facebook. She told me that my background is very impressive and asked me if I would be interested in a software engineer position. I said that I would be excited and she scheduled the next round of interview with a Facebook engineer. It wasn't an on-site interview but a phone screening interview right before one.The engineer first asked me why I would…  want to work at Facebook. Then we moved on to two technical questions. The first one was merging two sorted arrays (both length n) in the most efficient way when the latter of the arrays have buffer size 2n.The second question was writing a function that checks if a tree is a binary search tree. For the second question, I got the right idea of using in-order traversal to check if it is a binary search but couldn't finish the implementation on time. After the interview, I wrote it on a editor myself and was sad to find out that it was not that complex at all.Anyway I am still waiting for a reply and I hope I could proceed to on-site interview. :)

Internal Referral -> Phone Interview -> Onsite Loop -> OfferThe process was quick, however I interviewed before the holidays and had to wait until afterwards to hear the results. Everyone is really friendly and helpful. HR always keeps you updated on the process.

(Front End Developer)After going to a conference, and talking with several people from Facebook who also attended, I was contacted via email to see if I was interested in doing an interview.I said yes, and got my first phone interview a few days later. In a shared code environment I needed to do a recursion assignment, and also create a polyfill. It went okay, although I wasn't happy with my…  performance on the polyfill. This took about 40 minutes.The more surprised I was that they asked me for a second phone interview, whereby I also had to do a recursion question. I made it harder then necessary for myself, which was unfortunate.After this I was invited to Facebook HQ, and had to do 4 interviews. Interviews were about recursion, closures, css, implementations. Unfortunately I wasn't good enough for Facebook, so that got me messed up for a month or so. I thought I did pretty good, but needed too much time to get going.The recruiters and interviewers were great. The process went really smooth, and comfortable.

The interview process was very smooth. The recruiter kept me in the loop.

Whole process took about a month but that's because I request about 1 week of prep time for each stage of my interview. I had 3 on-site interviews in total - my screening was on-site because I live very close to HQ. I also did a 3rd round interview because my feedback for 2nd round was somewhat mixed. Overall, very pleased with the whole interview experience. The internal recruiter was…  very friendly and helpful in helping me prep, and also very communicative of each step and process that they're going through. Was never kept in the dark. Almost every interviewer was super friendly and knowledgeable. I had mix feelings before the interview but after the whole process, I was convinced that Facebook is a great place to work.

I applied through a referral from a former employee. The entire process took about a month. I had one phone screen, then a day of on-site interviews with four people. The interview process was good overall, mostly just the usual questions on coding, algorithms, past projects. The recruiter was helpful and communicative.

A software engineer called me via skype for the first technical internview. He first asked me my Ph.d research experience. And I describe my research topics to him in detail. Then he asked one detailed questions he was not quite familiar with. This part goes well, then we move to coding questions. He asked me two coding questions.

HR responded pretty fast, then they scheduled a phone interview.During the interview- They introduced their group- Talked about my project and work experience- Asked me a coding question ( I list it blow, because it is difficult question for most people I think)

interviewed when they recruited on campus. the recruiter and engineers were all very down to earth and helpful throughout the interview process. culture very different from other companies, because they appreciate generalists rather than specialists.questions are standard with minor tricks hidden.

Everyone was edgy when I started seeing people at Facebook, including the receptionists. Granted, job interviews tend to be critical, and we are the people who seemed to be begging for the highly-lucrative job positions.Then I saw this lady, who gave no self-introduction, no facial interaction, had only super-sharp look or pretended to be, who led me through these cold stairs, picked up a drink, and up to this tiny…  room, then started asking me questions.God bless her, turned out she was a software engineer, and may be the domain expert in my field.OK, so let's move on to programming, by which time I became edgy, too, knowing this lady sitting right behind me, feeling her freezing eyes examining up and down my neck, maybe my hair, too (I am a man). Did she notice my white hair as well?Anyway, the interview was quick (less than an hour), and I was let go. I knew there won't be any followup. Even if it does, am I willing to experience it again?What a fast way to ruin a day-off.

Interviewed in November 2013. Initially contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn. Entire process took around 3 or 4 weeks. Two initial interviews followed by an onsite interview. The initial interviews went well, but I failed onsite I believe. The company is very chill overall; they had a keg in one of the rooms when I visited.

On Campus Interview

Had a phone screen. Interviewer was a nontechnical person. She was unable to answer any questions I had regarding one of the questions. The questions were regurgitating textbook definitions for programming terminology.

I sent my resume in the September job fair and got an on campus interview on October. Less than one week later, I got the onsite interview invitation. I got the offer 3 days after the onsite.On campus is a 45-minute section. 2 programing questions. Not too hard.On site is also a 45-min section.

Started with a friendly talk with the recruiter, had 1 phone screen and then 4 on-site interviews. Everyone I talked to (including the recruiter!) was very Smart, friendly and engaging. I definitely felt a commitment to their role - even as interviewers!There was nothing unexpected on the interviews, so don't be afraid about the horror stories out there. If you're good you should do OK.

The FB recruiters were very on-the-ball and determined to get me to campus, and worked with me every step of the way. They flew me out, put me up in a nice hotel, and helped me know what to expect in the interviews. The process consisted of four interviews, broken up by lunch. Two "ninja" interviews (coding), one "jedi" interview (personality and values), and one systems design interview (whose cool…  name I forgot). The questions were tough, but fair. They definitely have a preference for code questions that combine data structures and creative thinking. My only complaint about the process was that they would spend a little too much time prior to starting the coding question asking me about my OS knowledge (I interviewed for a mobile job), and that left me pressed for time (sometimes) on the actual whiteboard coding.

Applied online and was contacted by Facebook. Had an initial screening interview which included basic questions of where I was and where I saw myself at Facebook. Then a scheduled technical interview was conducted.

I was contacted by a recruiter for the security team through email about a few openings on the security team. I said, I would like to know more. After a number of email exchanges to set up a time, another recruiter emailed me and told me someone would call me at the scheduled time. The first recruiter mentioned that I will be using the tool on collabedit.com. So far, I…  was not told what position I was actually interviewing for or whether I was setting up a time for a general interview or whether they were giving me more details! I did apply to a few different roles on their site so I wasn't sure what was up.Turns out first phone call was with hiring manager and I was getting interviewed for a software engineer position. Hiring manager asked if I was told what positions were available and I said no and he was glad to explain for me. I told the manager I was hoping for a security engineering job, not software engineering. He told me I might be a better fit for a different team and he will tell the other manager I was interested and I will hear from him. I asked if there was a opening on that team and he said they are always hiring new talent. I took that as a good sign. I didn't actually get asked to code during the phone interview. I followed up with the recruiters asking where to proceed and whether I could interview with the manager on the other team and they said they will get back to me.I waited and got no emails setting up another interview. I asked what's going on and have not heard back. It's been 10 days. I guess I have been dropped?I am disappointed at the lack of communication and lack of detail from the recruiters. I guess this is common with big companies.

Had asked my friend to refer, within a week was contacted by recruiter and was asked for dates for telephonic screen. Provided my date preference, and within 2 days the phone screen was scheduled. Got result of phone screen next day, and was invited to Facebook HQ for a day long interview. Facebook has University Day, where they call people and conduct their interviews, also on the same day they…  have campus tour with tech talk. But, as I had other offer deadline, they were pretty comfortable in scheduling "one-off" interview for me, and was called on non-university day just for the interviews.Interview process was awesome. Had total of 4 rounds (1 Behavioral and 3 technical). Also after first round, I was accompanied by Facebook Engineer for lunch, and he walked me over the campus. I loved the campus and the interaction with the engineer. He almost answered all my questions and further gave me reasons about why working at Facebook was awesome. Post lunch, had 3 back to back technical interviews. All the interviewers were smart, provided enough information about the problem and also left grey areas for me to ask and figure out. For all the questions, implementation was expected. Most of the time during my interviews, I was standing and writing/discussing code on the white board. Overall the day was hectic but it is indeed great fun as I got pretty interesting problems to solve and discuss.After the interviews, I got my result after a week.Summarize: Fast and Fair Process. Great experience.

Received message via LinkedIn for an interview, shortly after replying a quick phone call was set up to determine what my interests were and how it aligns with the work available at Facebook. After that, a phone interview is done to screen candidates, the phone interview involves actual coding done using a shared online notepad. Then an in person interview is done which consists of 4 interviews (algorithms - system…  design - class design/algorithms - behavioral). There is also a break where you can ask an engineer any questions regarding the company. Results come back in a week after the in person interview.

I uploaded my CV in their system and got contacted by a recruiter. In the initial phone screen we discussed my interests and strength and the recruiter got back to me about a group that sounded like a good fit.Since I was local I did the first technical interview directly on site. It took about 45min. My interviewer was not directly associated with the group that I talked about with…  the recruiter. But he did take my background into account when asking questions.It went pretty well and a couple of days later, they invited me back for a full day of interviews.The full day interviews were mostly general coding questions and one architecture session.Although this time, I was talking directly to the people from the group were I saw a fit with my background and interests, unfortunately the interviewers did not ask any related questions. They kept strictly to (I guess) Facebook approved coding questions. Those were very low level and I did only perform moderately well I think.The architecture session went much better and was almost related to my background.After the full day of interviews it was pretty clear that this was not a good fit. They confirmed that a couple of days later and the interview process stopped there.

Easy process. Be prepared..

I told them that I was on deadline with another offer from another top-tier Silicon Valley company, but even without special fast-tracking we managed to finish everything extremely quickly. On campus screen to onsite interview done within the same week and got my offer shortly afterwards!

It was 4 interviews in total with a lunch break in the middle.Two interviews are considered to be conding, one disign and one cultural with a little bit coding.Overal algorithmic problems on the interview were pretty simple.But they pay attention to implementation details, make sure that code actually works properly for all the cases and try different test cases.FB provides great hotel accomodation, one of the best hotels I've ever…  been :)

contacted the recruiter and took about ten days for him to respond. Interview was ok.

Was invited for an on-campus technical screen at the Seattle office. It was just 1 problem for which I was asked to solve and write pseudocode.The interviewer and the HR rep were friendly.

Telephone chat with recruiter followed by an onsite interview. Onsite interview had five 45 minute interview sessions, and all of them were very technical (writing code on the whiteboard or talking about system design).

Recruiter contacted on LinkedIn. Set up phone screen for a few days later, which consisted of basic behavioral questions and some technical questions (basically questions passed to the recruiters by engineering to weed out super weak candidates). Then a technical phone screen with an engineer. First a basic coding question. Second question was a weird one. It was basically a language specific question related to how to modify the default…  behavior of a certain class. I spent the rest and a long portion of the interview trying to understand what exactly needed to be done and couldn't come up with a solution at all. Then I asked the interviewer how what he was asking could be achieved and he told me about a similar class that would provide that capability. Since I had no idea about that class (and there's really no reason for anyone to know it off top of their heads), I wasted a lot of time trying to solve something that I could have never solved. This was akin to a trick question and obviously very flawed to ask to a software engineer to assess any analytical skills whatsoever. Then chit chatted with the engineer about Facebook but it was obvious that neither side wanted to engage in anymore conversation. Got a rejection email from the recruiter I believe a couple days later.

The interview process was pretty standard for campus recruiting. I had a 30 minute interview with two whiteboard programming questions and some general questions. Interviewer was nice and the whole experience was pretty easy. I'm sure on-site interviews would be more intense, but I wasn't fortunate enough to move on to that.

The processes started with a very quick phone screening that went over my interests, why I wanted to work for Facebook, etc, which was followed up by one or two phone interviews in which I was asked to enter code into a browser and answer a few technical questions. They also asked a few questions about my resume. I took a flight to their on-site interview which included a gorgeous…  hotel and generous compensation for food, etc. The on-site interview was a few hours but it flew by. Some interviewers seemed experienced and others seemed like they didn't know what they were doing in the interview room. Everyone I interacted with (from phone screening to the actual interviews) seemed very organized and the entire interview process was extremely smooth. I greatly appreciated their coordination and team effort.

Got a call for technical phone interview based on a referral. I don't see a point of answering/posting the coding question. You have to be really a good coder to hear back from them.Write a code to find the maximum and minimum number in an array. Now can you improve the code to use minimum number of comparison operaton. Less than n was the objective.

I had interviewed for a number of positions (full time and intern) before, and was never successful until this, my final chance. Luckily, things went in my favor and I was offered a full-time position.My recruiter was quick and very responsive over email. I already had an offer with another company at the time, and thus, my recruiter was able to expedite me through the already quick interview process. I…  had one coding challenge to be turned in whenever it was completed, a non-technical interview over the phone, and two on-site interviews. My first on-site interview was an interview with my recruiter plus a technical interview. My second on-site was a series of four technical interviews.All in all, I was very pleased with the sincerity and speed my recruiter put in and of course, being given an offer made was the cherry on top :).

I'm a Master student at a top CS grad school. I was doing an internship in Bay area in August and I started my process just two weeks before my last day there. Therefore the whole process was pretty fast because they (and I) want to finish all interviews before I leave so that I don't need to fly all the way from the east coast.My friend helped me submit…  my resume. A few days later the recruiter contacted me via Email to schedule an initial HR interview. In this HR interview he told me great things about facebook and asked for my related experiences and why I would like to join facebook. He looks satisfied with my background and we moved forward to schedule a technical phone screen.The phone screen went OK. I managed to code the first question in an efficient way but failed to figure out any possible way to solve its upgraded version with more constraints.I received an email from the recruiter two days after the phone screen and was told I passed it. We scheduled an on-site interview in the same week.The onsite interview consisted of three tech interviews. Two of them focused on pure coding/algorithm questions. One of them focused on behavioral questions and a easier coding question. I did well in one pure coding and the mixed one. I did OK in the last coding one: did not finish writing my code but the major part is clear and correct. I did make some minor mistakes and corrected them after the interviewer pointed it out.Four days after my on-site interview, the recruiter asked me for two references. Two days later I received the offer.

Process was extremely straight forward and everyone I dealt with was very friendly. I did a phone screen and then was flown to HQ to meet with engineers to have my skills tested.

2 phone interviews

had an onsite interview in lieu of phone screen

Application was via an internal referral from a friend who used to work at a start-up I was at. He put me in their system and around 4 days later, a recruiter called for first contact.The recruiter was quick to assess what I have done and decide to bring me straight in for a 1h30 min interview the next week. In this session I got a quick "hi" from the…  recruiter and then two 30 min slots, one on architecture and design (so called pirate interview) and the other on coding (ninja). Of the 2, I stormed the coding question but met with an interviewer in the pirate side that had tailored a question from his previous experience in the area I had recently worked in and it didn't work out (mostly as I knew more about the topic and the interviewer wanted to talk about a specific trick he knew). Still, I got called back the next week for a full day.Lunch, more coding, culture interviews etc... Coding and design were knockouts again, the softer skills were less successful. I think the key here is that you need to present a confident, well rehearsed personality with answers for the usual questions (biggest mistake etc...). DO NOT talk about mistakes and then admit you don't know the root cause for them, even if they were true mysteries. Pick another example!!!The process took ~4 weeks, the end dragging out by 2 weeks as it seems they could not decide if it was a hire or not. I had multiple offers by this time and had to take one that was expiring and too good to miss. Later I found that there was no hire decision and felt ok about it - I would probably think about going back at some point, but with a stronger prep in the softer skill Q+A side.

1. Phone screen - coding questions solved over phone, using an online shared doc.2. On-site interview - A day of 5 interviews, 45 minutes each. Two whiteboard coding interviews, one personality interview (how do you face conflicts at work etc.), one system architecture interview (high-level system design).3. Offer process - my recruiter was very helpful.

Got referred through a friend at FB. They contacted me 1-2 weeks later via email. Set up a phone chat that the recruiter initially missed, but we rescheduled. Once we had a phone conversation she said they can move really fast: ~1 week to make an offer.I went on site for a first round interview (since I'm local to the area). The interviewer was nice. She asked me to describe…  what I work on now. Then we jumped into two coding problems. I interpreted the problem as a Hamming Distance problem and asked if it was, she kind of shrugged it off -- I don't think she knew what Hamming Distance meant. I coded a solution on a laptop (new trial process they were doing), but it turned out we were not talking about the same problem. In retrospect, the problem she was describing was Levenshtein Distance. I had the feeling she only knew the solution to the problem because she had the answer sheet.The second problem was another classic DP problem. Finding the sum of 1's in a submatrix. I went on to describe the recurring relation for the subproblem in the linear case. She didn't want me to do that and she quickly said the solution to the 2D case was a generalization of the 1D case.Because of the novelty of the laptop in the interview and the misunderstanding of the initial problem, the recruiter fought for me to do another phone screen even though the first one didn't go that well.The second interview I opted for a phone interview. This time the interviewer seemed more knowledgable and came into FB through an acquisition. I was asked what I work on now and some hard problem I solved in the past. Again two interview questions were asked (using collabedit). The first was to list out all the paths in a binary tree which was simple. I did make some mistakes and corrected it in the code as we talked through use cases. The second problem was checking if a string was a palindrome for strings with symbols and spaces in them which again is easy. I did solve both problems, but in the beginning the interviewer stated he's looking for accuracy and performance. My tree traversal was a simple preorder traversal using recursion and the palindrome involved one loop.Apparently the second interview did not go well even though I provided correct solutions in both. I guess the interviewer was serious when he said he's looking for correctness -- I guess you need to be able to code compilable/error-free code in a text editor.The recruiter and onsite coordinator were very helpful and the interviewers were very friendly. However, the style of FB interviews seems to be that you should study and know by heart common interview puzzles/algorithms/DP problems and be able to reproduce that error free.

This was a phone screen. I said I didn't know html/javascript so they just asked me some programming questions: write a sqrt() function and a strstr() function. I wrote both in java. The sqrt used the bisection method, and strstr was just a nested loop.I didn't get called back probably because of wrong skill set. Not sure why they wasted the time since it was on my resume.

Started with a phone interview which led to an on-site. I had a coding question at the same level difficulty that you would expect for an on-site in the initial phone interview. The NYC office was really nice and the on-site interview process is about the same as most other tech companies, usually starting with coding questions and then one architecture/design question.

Contacted by recruiter, set up phone interview. Spoke with interviewer and was asked to implement Fibonacci sequence. Knowing that there are several methods of implementing it based on what is important (space, runtime) and what the goal is (for N > large values there's a constant time solution) Interviewer was unable to answer questions on the use and instead just told me to "just write something". I proceeded to implement…  the algorithm three ways.I asked a friend there if he knew the interviewer, found out later that the interviewer was reading off a script and that's why he couldn't explain the requirements better.Several weeks later was told they decided not to continue forward.

Two days after internal referral, recruiter contacted me and set-up a phone interview. The coding problems are standard and not difficult. Two weeks later, I went to their head quarter for the onsite interview. There are 4 rounds of technical interviews, involving coding and database design.Wait almost 4 weeks before the recruiter got back to me and offered me a position.

I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter via Linkedin and told that my profile indicated that I might be a good fit for one of their software roles. We set up an initial phone call and I filled out a basic email survey about my professional experience. One of the first questions on the phone was "tell me about your experience as a web developer". I have none, which I…  admitted in the pre-call survey and is obvious from my Linkedin profile. That seemed to be a big problem. The recruiter said he needed to check with his manager, then hung up and I never heard back.I still use facebook, but I have no interest in ever working there now.

I interviewed with then on campus after which the brought me to their office for another set of interviews. The questions were algorithmic and not super hard.The experience with HR was not great. They offered some hotels which were all expensive and when I found a cheaper hotel which would allow to get a rental car for less money they were hot quite happy (duh!).After the interview they didn't bother…  to tell me yes/no even though I already had other offers and I told them so.

I originally applied online and spoke with one recruiter. She did not feel I was a good fit for the team she was recruiting for but referred me to another recruiter at Facebook. I spoke with the second recruiter on the phone and she set a technical interview on-site in Menlo Park. The guy who interviewed me was very nice and while I didn't do a great job on the…  question, they liked me enough to schedule a full day of interviews.After some preparation, I came onsite for a full-day of technical interviews with a lunch break in the middle. The pace was very fast but I knew it would be like that so I was prepared. The questions were difficult especially in the limited amount of time. Everyone was very nice. There was a design round where I was asked to design an iPhone app that was unrelated to social networking.

Short and concise. There were 3 rounds of interview: phone, technical, in-person. Overall a smooth process. Got asked a bunch of real scenario technical questions. Be prepared to demonstrate your thought process and critical thinking.

They will ask you technical questions about your area of expertise, but they don't wait very long for the answer before they start giving hints.

Pretty straightforward interview process - screener interview followed by a 4 interview loop. Facebook uses the loop to do two standard algorithms/data structures technical interviews, one manager/fit interview and one "design" interview which I misunderstood to mean user facing design, but instead is more of an architecture, big box drawing exercise.

1) Calculate the square root of a double2) Given n intervals [si, fi], find the maximum number of overlapping intervals.3) Print all the paths from root to every leaf in a binary tree.4) Print the sum of all the numbers at every vertical level in a binary tree5) Given a set of n jobs with [start time, end time, cost] find a subset so that no 2 jobs overlap and…  the cost is maximum ?6) Given 1 trillion messages on fb and each message has at max 10 words, how do you build the index table and how many machines do you need on the cluster to store the index table ?

I came onsite for what was described as an hour-long introductory and technical interview. I was greeted by the recruiter and shown around the office (FB NYC), then we chatted for 10-15 minutes. Then an engineer came in and we started the technical part of the interview, which took 45+ minutes (we ran over).First he asked me about Hadoop, since I mentioned that I used it at my current job.…  I used hadoop for machine learning tasks, so we discussed the details of the system.The rest of the interview was coding on a whiteboard. The questions got progressively more difficult.The first was: Given two string representations of binary numbers (e.g. "1001", "10") write a function that adds them and returns the result as a string as well (e.g. "1011").The next had several parts:(a) first, write a function to calculate the hamming distance between two binary numbers(b) write a function that takes a list of binary numbers and returns the sum of the hamming distances for each pair(c) the answer I gave for b was O(n^2), I was then tasked with finding a more efficient solution. I struggled mightily, and was eventually helped to the solution by many hints from the interviewer.After that, I had a chance to ask questions of the interviewer, and then we were done. I don't know if I've made it to the next round or not.

I was contacted by a recruiter about a possible position. While I was not immediately looking, I was intrigued enough to continue with the process.I had a quick phone call with my recruiter to go over my background and experience. She concluded the phone call by determining my availability for a technical phone screen and followed up with some research materials to better prepare for the phone screen.The technical phone…  screen was set up using collabedit as the platform for sharing code between myself and the interviewer. I was asked a few simple technical questions, and a few harder programming problems dealing with algorithms and data structures. The interviewer was patient and helpful.The recruiter emailed me the same evening to let me know that I would not be moving further in the process, as my initial hesitations on the early data structure questions signalled poor understanding of basic concepts.

2 step process - started with a phone screen. Most of time on the phone screen was taken by a programming challenge, which was done through one of those online code editors. Passed it to get an on-site interview. Your interview continues so long as you're doing well. At then end, you get a tour of the facebook campus before being showed out.

I was contacted on 25 February via LinkedIn following a recommendation. The position was in the Mobile Operations team. It was followed by a series of phone interviews: - one with the technical sourcer - one with the head of the team - two more with some specialists in various departmentsFollowing the phone interviews, was an onsite interview in Menlo Park on 22 April. Given the 10 hrs time zone difference, they were…  sympathetic with the jet lag and flew me there on Saturday for the Monday interviews. The interview day had five sessions: - one with the head of the team - one with guys from the team (codding session) - one with a guy from management - two more with guys from other departments (systems and networking)With the exception of codding interview, where a second guy was there to observe, all other interviews were 1:1I flew out on Tuesday, and on Thursday I received a call that they were happy with my performance and we can move forward.

An internal recruiter contacted me out of the blue by Linkedin and email. We scheduled a phone call. Talked about my experience and education and then about available positions at Facebook. He then invited me to come onsite for a short screening interview first. I requested a couple of weeks to prepare for the interview. He was perfectly ok with that and even sent me some links to preparation materials.Instead…  of a phone screen, I had a short 1:1 interview for 45 minutes onsite. Mostly coding on whiteboard and a little time set aside for questions about the company.A week after that, four 1:1 interviews. Two coding interviews. One "manager" interview: mostly talking about past projects and future ambitions. One system design interview - you basically have to describe how you would design a given system without going into too much detail.Received a call from recruiter next day. He said that I will have to come for one more interview. So a week after I had another series of two interviews, one coding and one manager.I received an offer two days after the last interview.During the whole process, the company was very flexible about scheduling interviews. Everything happens really fast if you want it, or you can take your time to prepare.Recruiter was very nice and supportive, as were people at FB in general. Some interviewers did not talk much and some were more willing to discuss, but all were very polite.Coding questions involve basic data structures like trees, combinatorial problems and sometimes a relatively simple dynamic programming problem. They are not too hard but you have to do them quickly and explain everything clearly. Understanding of Big-O is a must!

I applied online through Linkedin and got an email from a FB recruiter asking whether we can arrange sometime to talk on phone. We then had a quick talk on phone about what I was doing, what I had done related to software development, and how was an interview process with FB. Then he said he will arrange a phone interview for me. The first phone interviewer was nice and…  I can answer the question easily although I did not understand the question correctly. But he was very patient explaining it to me and I finally did it right. After a week I received an email from the recruiter saying that the response to the first interview was positive and they wanted to schedule another phone interview. The second phone interview was a week later with a Chinese girl who did not sound friendly or enthusiastic but with a cold voice. I felt that she did not like me and would not want me to be in FB since the beginning of the interview. This made me very nervous and confused, and I lost my confidence. Hence, even though the question was quite simple but I did not do it well. I can guess what happen next: I got a "thanks from FB" the day after.

After one phone interview, get the onsite invitation. There are four rounds.

one telephonic interview and then onsite interview. 4 interviews during onsite interviews.

A recruiter contacted me. After a few days of back and forth we set up a phone interview. In the phone interview we discussed a possible problem that involved trees. I struggled to implement the necessary algorithm.Eventually, I got to ask a couple of questions about facebook.Received a decline a couple weeks later.

Interviewed as a new grad. There's a two-part phone interview, then a in-house interview @ their Menlo Park HQ, and then follow-up interviews if necessary. They also need your references to check.

1 round hr check + 1 round phone screen + onsite

Got contacted by Recruiter and then set up phone screen

phone interview.

Get contact from their recruiter. And take a 45 minutes interview with them. two coding question. Can't tell details due to NDA. One is about string match, and another is about binary tree. From what I observe, efficiency really matters. And no need to do the perfect, but describe your idea clearly and keep conversation is important.

Phone interview after refer from employee, the process went well, and the interviewer is respect and patient. Details will be given to help understand questions, no blablabla, just coding questions, interviewer will be asked for Big-O analysis

Linkedin mail from recruiter. Process was relatively straightforward. Had a pair programming session with an engineer on one programming problem.

Gave recruiter my resume at campus career fair, I was one of the first ones there and went to their booth 2nd after Google, so getting their early might help your chances for an interview. A few weeks later I was contacted for an on campus interview and only given 2 days to prepare.

Met recruiter at University event, got a call by night for on campus interview. Interview was the next day. Second round was the next day and more difficult, but I also had a terrible interviewer.

On campus interview....

I had an on-site interview -- it was an hour long. The questions were simple -- on string and bit manipulation. I signed an NDA, so can't disclose the question. You need to have quick coding skills.

I first can an email from a recruiter who helped me to arranged 2 phone interviews using skype. The interviewers are two current software engineers. After the phone interview, I was informed that I cannot proceed the interview process.

I was contacted by the recruiter who found me via graph search, and was asked whether I was job hunting. I chose to go onsite for the initial phone screen. The question was straightforward with emphasis on fast and accurate coding, and the interviewer was very knowledgeable.A few days after the screen the recruiter scheduled an on-site with me, and the dates were quite flexible. The on-site consisted of four…  interviews, 3 pure coding (of which one is about design) and 1 research interview (I guess this is for all PhD applicants). I was quite happy with the coding ones but the research one was, well, a little annoying since the interviewer seemed to be dismissive to everything. But overall, it was a nice experience, two interviews plus lunch + tour around plus two in the afternoon, and it was done!I did wait for 3 weeks till the decision was make, and during the period the HR seems to be a little nonresponsive. When I followed up what I received was something like a one line email saying "we are reviewing your case and will come back to you soon". This was a little annoying especially the feeling of being silently rejected started to grow, but I guess it is not the HR's fault anyway.In the end I was offered a job with flexible titles - software engineer or research scientist or whatever. I decided not to take the offer in the end, but the interview process was very smooth.

Had a 30 min interview on campus. The interviewer was pretty late. He asked on coding question. Once I gave a solution he asked to improve the Order.

The hiring process is very fast. After I contacted by the recruiter, she arranged 1st technical interview in less than week. The second one was planed 2 day after and onsite interview just 2 weeks after fist contact. The hardest part is to get noticed, so I suggest find somebody inside to recommends you.

Had an HR phone call that was mostly basic questions about previous experience, and why I feel I would be a good fit at Facebook. At the end of the call, we set up an on-site technical interview. Had to postpone it a while, but they were very helpful with rescheduling whenever was convenient for me. The technical interview went well, getting a tour of the facility before sitting down…  with an engineer. The interview lasted around an hour. I was asked a question about checking for palindromes, and a question about graph traversal. Ran into some trouble with the graph traversal, which I eventually described to the interviewer correctly, but didn't have enough time to write it on the whiteboard. I think that's the reason I was told to get more experience and reapply in a few months.

They came to my university, two 30 minute interviews, first one was pretty basic, 2nd one was hard. It was a pretty simple process, there were about 10-15 other people interviewing with me, it was for a standard Summer intern position at Facebook. They came to my school and interviewed a bunch of people, a lot of them through a hackathon at the school.

Found by recruiter, very professional

I went to my college's career fair and dropped off my resume with Facebook, we had a nice chat. Next week, they sent me an e-mail asking me to come in for a first-round interview on campus. The day before the interview, we had a nice meet and greet in the computer science tea room. They were very friendly, and we got to know each other better. The next day,…  I had my first interview. It comprised of a few technical questions, and runtime analysis which I think I answered correctly. In the evening, they e-mailed me telling me I've made it to the second (final) round. However, I did not manage to complete the second round challenge within the time limit, and I was not given an offer.

interview at Harvard, 45mins, 3 not difficult questions.

Was referred by the current employee and contacted by the recruiter pretty soon. After a few basic screening questions 2 phone interview were scheduled. Each one for 45 minutes and 5 minutes for additional questions.The same applies for on-site part, but there are 4 interviews: Generic, Design and 2 Coding - related. The basic scheme - check your background, got some view on your previous job and than talk about…  technical problems.The recruiter and all the interviewers are really nice and helpful, it's a real pleasure to be interviewed here.

I solved a challenged at interviewstreet.com 2 weeks after they emailed me asking to send my CV along with some answers, for example: preferred programming languages, current job, time constrains, availabity for interview...Another email telling me about how to get prepared for the interview (visiting glassdor.com).After I replied, 1 week later we coordinated the skype interview.The interview was kind and explained to me any doubt I had.They called me explaining the…  good and bad things I did on my first phone screener, and then we planned a second interview. I was able to solve the second problem but probably I took more time than expected and had some bugs that the interviewer helped me to find out.The day after the second interview I was said "thanks" by Facebook, that my background didn't fit any current position.

I applied online via their online challenge website. After a few days, I received email from Facebook asked if I'd like to have phone interviews. I got two phone interviews, both of which are focused on algorithms / data structures. Then after a few days, I got the chance to do an onsite interview. On that day, I met with four people, one was focused on culture fit, two were…  focused on coding, and the last one is testing my design skills.

Career fair, 30 min interview a week after.

My application was submitted through an internal referral, and I was contacted by the recruiter within a week. The recruiter was very helpful in providing tips on preparing the interview and the format of the interview.Even though I didn't get an offer, the overall interview process was very pleasant. Each interviewer is assigned to test on one or two specific skill set of yours. All the coding and design questions…  are fair interview questions, and the interviewers were all pretty friendly.I had an additional "practice" interview to prepare an interviewer to learn how to interview. Also, most of the interviews had a shadow interviewer, but this seems to be the norm for all the companies I interviewed.

I got the interview through on-campus recruiting at my university. I had two on campus interviews with software engineers. I received an offer within 3 days of the second interview. I was also flown out for University Day, however I did not have to participate in any interviews at that point.

1 phone round interview and 1 onsite interview. Onsite had 2 coding round interview, 1 manager interview and 1 design interview.

Quick hiring process - first interview is all technical. It will be all on algorithms and memory complexity.

Phone: 3 roundsOn-site: several roundsCulture: professionProblems are neither hard nor tricky.The biggest challenge is Offensive Chinese Interviewer.If they show disregard of your question about the interview problem, don't be frustrated, keep asking what you want to know. If you give up asking, you may lose some important information that you should check with them at first. And when they are picky about your code, or when they indicate that there…  are bugs in your code, check it carefully, fix as much as you can. And then try to let them discuss the remaining bugs, even if you can't find any more, and no matter how dictatorial they are. Don't end up arguing with them on whether it's really a bug.

I was referred by a college friend. The whole precess was about 3 weeks (excluding time to get visa, Christmas and new year holidays).Interview Details Started with a friendly talk with the recruiter, had 1 phone screen and then 4 on-site interviews + 1 lunch interview. Everyone was was very Smart and kind of friendly during the interview.

Task schedule: given a sequence of task like A B C(means 3 different tasks), and a coldtime, which means you need to wait for that much time to start next [same] task. Now----Input: string, nOutput: the best task-finishing sequence.eg. input: AAABBB, 2Output: AB_AB_AB( "_" represents do nothing and wait)

All interviewers are very kind. It doesn't matter to make small mistakes during interview, interviewers are willing to give some hints to help you correct it. It is always good not to stuck at some point.I got my first interview from TopCoder, that was a in person interview, one algorithm question in 3 different difficulty levels.I waited for 2 months to get my second interview, it was a 45-min phone…  interview, 2 algorithm questions. It took about 30 mins to finish the coding phase, then I asked some questions about FB culture and backend engineering team.Then the Christmas came, I got feedback of 2nd interview in early January, which is positive, so they decided to flew me to Menlo Park for onsite interview. The process was quick, they pay for the flight and hotel.There were 5 rounds of onsite interviews:- 2 coding interviews, both were testing how quick and accurate interviewee can solve the problem. Problem is not very difficult, some can be found at glassdoor here.- 1 backend system design, interview asked me to explain one of the backend systems I designed. During the interview, he raised a lot of questions about the system, mostly about scalability, reliability and performance.- 1 client side system design, asked to design a client side component.- 1 half-behavior and half-coding interviewIt was pleasant experience to interview with Facebook:-)

Contacted by a recruiter to have a general discussion of my career goals. When she learned that I had other offers, the process was expedited. Went through a phone screen and then was brought onsite.The interviewers were all very friendly, didn't feel like I was being judged, lots of positive energy from the interviewers.The coding questions weren't particularly difficult, though the pirate design interview was more challenging/fun.

The interview process was pleasant. I had four interviews, 1 half coding and half cultural fit, one design, two coding interviews. None of the coding questions was difficult. The recruiter sent you links for coding preparations. If you did you homework, then you would have seen the questions there. I had the feeling that they wanted you to code fast, neat and bug free.

After being contacted by the recruiter, I had a technical phone interview, and was then flown on-site for a detailed interview. The overall experience was excellent, with enthusiastic, encouraging people. All accommodation and transportation costs were covered. The interviews were of one of the following types: coding, cultural fit or architectural design.

2 phone questions

Similar to any other review on this site.

I was participating in Facebook Midwest Regional Hackathon, and got contacted by the recruiter shortly thereafter at my university. We scheduled the first phone interview, which was a technical interview. The questions included printing binary search tree in reverse, finding k-th largest element in O(N) without modifying the node, and then same k-th largest element in log(N) time keeping the size of the subtree in each node.

Had brief phone conversation with interviewer initially, who scheduled a technical interview with an engineer working at Facebook HQ.The second technical interview was fairly relaxed, I was asked to solve two problems using collabedit.com, firstly, finding all the anagrams in an array of strings, secondly, finding the number of ways a given score could be reached for a game with 3 different ways of scoring (e.g. 3, 5 and 10…  points).After the phone interview I was offered an onsite interview in at Menlo Park (travel expenses paid for). The interview day involved 4 back to back interviews with different engineers. The questions varied in complexity and required answers to be given on a white board. Those I can remember was implementing combinations(n, k), printing a binary tree L-R, and implementing a comparator function to sort files based on a certain naming convention.I found it difficult to make any personal connections with my interviewers, they all seemed rushed and uninterested in striking up conversation - it was not an enjoyable experience. Indeed, my first interviewer was clearly more interested in what he was working on as he arrived ~20minutes late.

Submit the CV online and they contacted me after couple of days and set up an interview.

Sent resume through campus career fair. They set up a phone interview within a week. I was called for on-site interviews at Menlo Park after a few days. Three interviews, lunch and campus tour, followed by two tech talks of sorts.The questions were fairly simple. Basic trees, recursion, order of complexity etc.

I met the recruiter in an event hosted by the university, and then send her my application. In one week, they schedule an interview for me.It was 1-1 phone interview, purely technical. The interviewer asked me some small algorithm problems, and then asked me to write code. Sometimes they will ask you to optimize your first solution and, also, write the optimized code. They are very friendly, it's ok to…  ask for some hints and fix some minor bugs in code.I had two phases of interviews, same style, and then got the offer.

Five Interviews:Talked about a past project and deep dived into my thinking about it.Design a probabilistic english language word tokenizer.Design a data processing infrastructure for petabytes of data and estimate the cost & perf characteristics of the system.Permutate ways to count up to a number using a set of potential constituents.How to efficiently choose numbers from a set and prove that the solution is the big-O optimal solution.

I was cold-called by a recruiter and offered a technical interview. I scheduled the interview, but in the meantime, I received an offer from another company, and canceled the interview.Later, I decided to re-apply for the same position and the process continued where it was left.I was interviewed by phone and asked to complete a coding assignment. As I discovered later, this assignment appears here as one of the questions.Later,…  I was notified I passed the phone screening and was invited for an on-site interview. There was a total of 4 interviews, including three coding interviews. Even though most of the questions appeared on this site, I did not do very well in the coding part, thus, as expected, did not receive the offer.Throughout the entire process, the hiring staff was extremely helpful and provided lots of information regarding the position, and the interviewing process itself. The recruiter also organized a phone call with on of the engineers to help me learn more about the position I was applying for. While at Menlo Park, I was accompanied by the recruiter and she showed me all around the campus.

I had one phone interview, before I was invited to on-site interview on their new office in Menlo Park.They paid for all the expenses incurred during the trip (hotel, transportation, food, and any other non-personal expenses)The on-site event lasted from 9 am to 4 pm. It started with a breakfast on one of their micro kitchen located on every floor of their building, and soon after the breakfast every candidate…  was taken to a room where they took three 45-minutes interview with Facebook engineers. One was behavioral, and 2 were technical.In a behavioral interview, interviewer will look at your resume and ask you couple of questions related to it, so make sure you are able to talk about whatever you put on your resume.Two technical interview is mainly coding on a whiteboard. They will ask some basic question like "why did you choose Facebook" at the very beginning, but the majority of your time there will be spent coding on a whiteboard.After the interviews, candidates are taken to a lunch on one of the cafeteria on their campus. I really loved the food there, and they have lot of different choices (Italian, Chinese, grills, ...).After lunch there was 45-minute tour around the Facebook campus.The event concluded with two tech talks (one backend and one frontend) and Q&A sessionOverall it was a great experience.

After a phone interview from the recruiter, I had a rather easy Skype technical interview (3 algorithmic questions, answered all of them correctly). Within 2 weeks I was informed that I was approved for an onsite interview in Palo Alto HQ. There I had 4 consecutive interviews (Ninja, Pirate, Jedi, Ninja). Ninja interviews require coding in board practice - quite difficult since if you answer correctly in one of them…  they ask something else. Jedi was related to my PhD. Pirate was the most difficult one as there were no right/wrong answer and questions were related to database design and overall Facebook feature design. The interviewers were very friendly and helpful. In overall, a great experience!

First part was solving a timed coding challenge from interviewstreet website; then I got a phone call to schedule a phone interview. The phone interview consisted of 3 algorithmic problems to be solved in a shared text editor.After this round, about 2 months later I went for onsite interviews. There were 3 interview, each 45 minutes long, with no pause between them. Mainly algorithm and data structs problems (backtracking, BST,…  dynamic programming)

No phone screen. One on-site in NY, one in CA. Both about 5 hours. Very pleasant experience. People were friendly and engaging.

Nothing exciting here, phone screen and than invite for onsite interview.Most coding questions you can probably get out of the Programming Interviews Exposed books. Really UN-impressed with any real creativity there. There was an architecture question during the on site which was fun and interesting, but all the coding questions were a waste of time, especially when the person interviewing did not even know the answer to his own question.…  Overall impressions, campus is beautiful, the people I met were not to the caliper I thought they would be.. Seemed like more talent was at Amazon or Google.

The process was fast and challenging. Phone interview, then remote technical interview with live coding through a web code share site. After passing those rounds I was invited to onsite interview in Menlo Park. The onsite interview involved 4 different people, with a lunch break. I am in my mid 30's in age, and I must say I felt like the old guy at the club. My interviewers were all…  younger than me, and had a palpable air of superiority. I felt like I nailed each of the interviews, but was not extended an offer with "You struggled on one of the interviews" as the only explanation. Its hard for me shake the thought that it was more work culture than work skill that prevented me from receiving an offer. All in all, no complaints. It was a fun and challenging experience and I ended up with a better job in the long run.

Got a mail from a recruiter asking me if I am interested.Then he scheduled a coding interview on Skype. They instructed me before this interview to go over all of the CS basics.I did the interview, was OK, and then I was invited to an on-site interviews day.Although I live outside of the US they had no problem flying me over, they paid for all expenses and arranged this whole…  thing in one week(!!).At the campus I had 4 interviews:1 X design "high level" interview.1 X manager interview, we talked a lot about the product(s), company's culture and my background. (And a short coding questions in the end)2 X white board coding interviews.After the first two interviews I had lunch with this extremely nice recruiter and she also gave me a tour in the campus which was really cool.Couple of days after the on-site day I was contacted and they told me that they need to interview me some more because there was a miss match within the feedbacks I got.We set up another session of two consecutive Skype coding interviews which were really good and after couple of days I was informed that they want to send me an offer ;-)Total 7 interviews.5 of them were coding.TIPS:* Get extremely comfortable with CS undergrad material:classic algorithms, data structures, sorting, string manipulations(!!), lists, trees, basic linear algebra, working with large data sets.Don't only read about these topics - make sure you can code it, fast and accurate!!In the Skype/Phone interviews they asked me to write the code in http://collabedit.com.[I am not allowed to disclose the specific questions... sorry]* If you are reading this review then you are on the right track - I practiced only by answering questions which were posted on this site. I first tried to solve them alone, when stuck I checked the answers section and on StackOverflow.* Make sure you are well familiar with this company and its product. It will come up in every interview and especially in the manager interview.Be ready to give great answers on "Why facebook?" - I think all 7 interviewers asked me this question and it's really important to them.* For non US residents - Make sure you arrive to the bay area couple of days before so you'll be able to rest and beat the jet-leg. I've arrived 24 hours before, couldn't sleep because of the excitement and jet-leg, I think that being really tired (especially after lunch) affected my performances.BOTTOM LINE -Challenging for a position at FB is huge and you have to invest a lot of time and effort into it. At least that was the case for me, I studied real hard and almost didn't make it.

A recruiter has contacted me through linked-in, asked whether I'll be interested to work for them, then had a talk about why would I like to work for them and I replied: that I would like to work with the best engineers.Afterward I had a phone interview with some engineer, asked me to write binary search, when I finished, he asked me to write binary search on a shifted array…  (10 20 1 2 3 4). Wrote that and then asked me to find the offset (2) in log n. I guess I did that ok and then I was invited to onsite interview.

After I solved a puzzle through InterviewStreet.com, a recruiter contacted me by e-mail and we set up an introductory phone call (15 min). She seemed really nice, she asked me to evaluate my knowledge on several technologies and sublects like C++, Perl, Algorithms/Data Structures, .NET Framework etc. She immediately told me that she was going to schedule a technical interview with an engineer.The engineer called me several days later and…  asked me to solve together an algorithmic problem via a workspace sharing website. We could both write code simultaneously and see each other's work. The question wasn't hard and although I had a pretty good idea how to solve the task, I wasn't very smooth and made several mistakes. Maybe because it was my first technical interview ever.Bottom line, I liked their attitude and they did a good job. It was my fault that I didn't go to a second interview and I've learnt my lessons. It was a very good experience.

I had a great feeling of solid communication with recruiters. The recruiters kept me accurately informed about interview progress. In order to establish an appropriate level of compensation, they seek information about my current employment without being invasive. I have felt interview process can be described by integrity and maturity, making Facebook a great place to work.This is in stark difference with my experience I have interviewing for other companies…  (namely Google) where after I passed the technical interviews, the recruiters pushed for very detailed compensation information, even though they in the end failed to provide an offer, missing deadlines in communication causing me to miss a competitive exploding offer.

Applied their careers page, got a response within 3 days. I was asked some Qs about my education and work-ex, then was asked to fill up a questionnaire,was given a choice of Phone interview or on campus, I scheduled on campus, cleared that than had a full day, interview.

I was referred by a friend. Got a phone call within 2 days from a recruiter. An interview was set up with the hiring manager of the team I interviewed for. Standard data structures and algorithms screen. Passed that pretty easily. I had 2 more phone calls and one onsite. Overall pretty pleasant experience.

Initial communication was through a recruiter, who reached out unprompted via LinkedIn. After chatting with the recruiter briefly over the phone, she quickly set me up for a phone interview, which was not that difficult/unexpected. This was followed by a half-day on-site interview, which involved lunch followed by meeting with four separate employees four 45-60 minutes each. Interviews were back-to-back, and the last interviewer escorted me back to the lobby.

I was contacted by recruiter via employee referral. Chose to go on site for initial interview. This was followed by onsite day of interviews a few weeks afterwards (I asked for some time to prepare for coding tests). The second set of interviews comprised of 2 coding tests, one design, one behavioral, lunch with hiring manager and one interview related to my technical specialization. Received offer within a week of…  final set of interviews.

I sent an application in for a position as a new grad, and the person who received my resume forwarded me to university recruiting. From there I had one phone-screen with HR, three technical interviews over the phone, and then they flew me out to Menlo Park for in-person interviews. There were four interviews during the day, each one was part technical interview, part general-fit questions, and at each one…  I got a chance to ask the person interviewing questions about the company. A few weeks after the interview they asked for references to contact, and a few days after that I received an offer.

First step is one or two phone screens, then a half-day or more of on-site interviews. Focus is on programming and architecture talent, but they're also looking for a good cultural fit. An important thing is that you may be interviewed targeted for a specific function, or for general engineering qualifications. In any case, after boojtcamp, you will be shopped around to all the groups that are looking for people,…  and you get to call your shot, so you don't have to have your specific career path chosen before you apply.

The recruiter called up and asked me if I was interested in the job opportunity. The process began with solving a programming problem on InterviewStreet for which I was given 90 minutes to solve. This was followed by a 60 minute telephonic interview. After clearing these two rounds, I was invited onsite and I had to go through 3 face-to-face interviews. The problems were hard algorithmic problems and you are…  expected to write clean code in the first go. The interviewers were really friendly and helpful. My advice would be that you have confidence in yourself and be as honest in an interview as possible. For practice, you should be well versed with standard algorithmic techniques like dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, solving linear recurrences in logarithmic time, recursion, tree traversals, etc.

Consists of 1 phone interview, 4 1:1 face to face interviews and 1 follow-up phone interview. The recruiter told me that they are concerned of my system design skills so the gave me another shot after the on-site interview, after that, he told me I did well but they decided to interview me one more time on system design, but two days later he called me again and cancelled the…  2nd follow-up interview. I was a little bit upset as they promised another interview but all I can do is move on.

I was contacted by recruiter on LinkedIn asking me if I was interested in software engineering opportunities. Two weeks later I had a phone call with recruiter and we talked about my background and hiring process. Four weeks later I had a Skype Interview with one of Facebook's software engineer. The interview was consisted of:- Interviewer's introduction.- Technial discussion about one of my projects.- Coding.

They found me at SO careers for some reason. First we had a HR with nothing really particular then an other skype/phone interview with real time coding. The guy was ok and friendly, answering all my questions. It was the usual American style interview with absolutely meaningless basic CS questions.

First round interview at the facebook seattle office. The question was related to string parsing : basically given a set of key value pairs in some format, to print them according to another format. I did not understand the specifications clearly and probably should have spent more time doing that. Instead, I went through many iterations with the interviewer pointing out specific mistakes each time. My advice : the question…  may be very different from what you think it probably is, so spend enough time making sure you get it. Also, in case of this problem, it was algorithmically very simple, but you are bound to miss some cases and make certain mistakes. So, when you see a simple problem, try to look at the problem and your solution carefully for possible gotchas.

There were 2 phone calls with techinical questions about data structure. The second guy gave me some wrong condition

A short initial phone chat with the recruiter (Who was excellent, even offering tips for the main interview) and then a technical phone interview with a developer.The developer I spoke to was great, seemed like a nice guy and managed to pose some tough technical questions without seeming combative.They got back to me within a couple of days to let me know they wouldn't be taking it further.

Facebook recruiter contacted me via twitter and LinkedIn and asked if I was interested in a career opportunity in Facebook. After that the recruiter scheduled an HR interview with himself via Skype. This was just a standard HR interview. The recruiter was very friendly. The whole call was very relaxed.After that he decided to schedule a phone screen with an engineer from California. This consisted of just a few HR…  questions eg. "What would you change in Facebook?". After that he gave an assignment on collabedit.

Got the interview referred by an employee. The interview process was very impersonal, with canned e-mail responses and literally no connection between the recruiter and the applicant. The recruiter persistently ignored my questions regarding team assignments. Had only one interview, with the "collaborative" coding question asked within the first 15 seconds of picking up the phone. Poor English skills of the interviewer and unwillingness to provide any hints were extremely…  unexpected. Despite providing the complete theoretical solution to the problem, the interviewer toyed with me not finding a small mistake in the code. After "deciding to move forward with other candidates" the recruiter declined to provide any feedback on the application. Undeniably it's a great place to work, but the recruiting process left a bad taste in my mouth.

I was looking for a development manager position, and the phone interview was conducted by a cocky 23 year old asking me that new hires should be asked. I was instantly turned off. I may give them a nother chance sometime in the future, but accepted another other somewhere else.

first screening interview followed by onsite interview 5 interviews with coding problems and behavior. the people were friendly, and the recruiters were very helpful in answering questions. the interviewers talked passionately about the projects they were working on as well as projects that they weren't working on but aligned with my interests inside the company that were ongoing.

He asked me to write a program on a game update

A recruiter contacted me after a mutual friend gave them my resume. They were aware that I had a pending offer that I had to make a decision on, and were very good about moving the process along as quickly as possible.I lived nearby, so I did two on-site interviews initially. After completely bombing one of them but doing well on the other I was brought in a little bit…  later for the full interview. I had about 5 people interview me. Afterwards they were still unsure so I had a couple phone interviews/conversations.The recruiter did a great job of keeping me up-to-date about what was happening, was very honest with me, and was able to rush to get me an offer (which was especially nice because it was almost Christmas at the time)

Normal tech-industry interview process. Whiteboarding/coding, from superficial (trivial) questions, to deep systems knowledge questions. Very difficult interview, but very rewarding experience.

Sent in my resume and got a recruiter e-mail 2 days later.Had 2 initial on-site intervies in Seattle, then a full loop (4 interviews) in California, and 1 final interview.On my full loop one interviewer felt like I didn't do as well on the coding question and they asked me to do 1 more interview.Overall the recruiter kept in touch with me throughout the process.

The interview process was a little bit chaotic, unexpected things happened, for example, the recruiters took a long time to respond. In the end it worked out, but as a cautionary tale, I'd like to leave it here.

Asked implementing dir *. Really unprepared, and has not manipulated string for long time. bad result.

First got an HR interview, asking very basic questions including some simple technical questions. Then first round asked me a coin probability problem. After that, the 2nd interviewer asked me sqrt() but I stupidly failed this problem. Great people, though interviewers are not very friendly.

Facebook did a phone interview after a coding test. At first they wanted me to solve one of their quiz problems before doing the coding test. Since I was busy they decided to just do the coding test. While I presumably passed the coding test, Age Discrimination appears rampant over at Facebook. You got phone interview questions such as "We work hard so how many hours do you typically put…  on the job?". I don't think it matter how you answered that question because I suspect they are looking for people to work 168 hours a week.

I got a phone call from a recruiter one day after I applied online. She asked me general questions about my experience and expectations. Onsite interview happened about 10 days later. I only talked to one guy, he once again asked me about my experience, about what I like about FB. Then he asked me one coding questions: given is a binary tree, write a function that returns Lowest Common…  Ancestor of two given nodes. After I did that, there was some time when I was allowed to ask some qustions about the company/team/ etc. Next day I received an email saying they have no position for me.

i got invited to onsite after a morning phone interview in the afternoon. it was very fast. then went to onsite

Was referred by an employee and then contacted by an HR. Had 3 rounds of phone interviews and then was called for onsite interviews. The questions were aimed at testing coding and design skills. They are looking for people who can write the correct code at the first go. So my advice would be that you revise all the basic algorithms, look at the common interview questions and practice a…  lot of coding on paper/whiteboard. The level of questions was not as difficult as Google.

Phone screen, Excel test, phone interview, skype interviews, 30 page assignment, flew out for on-site interviews, more phone interviews, flew out again for on-site interviews.They put me through the ringer before they hired me. But the questions were relevant and the people I met were great. This was back in their Palo Alto offices though.

Got contacted via LinkedIn. Had a chat with the recruiter, a very friendly lady, who asked about my background and about 8-10 simple programming questions at the end. Scheduled a phone interview with an engineer, who was also quite polite and helpful. After asking about my background, he gave me two questions. It wasn't my area of expertise (algorithms) so I did just okay, nothing superstar. Two days later I…  was told that there aren't any positions fit for me at present but they'd like to stay in touch.

A Facebook HR recruiter contacts me directly through Facebook saying if I am interested in interview. The process consists of a phone interview and an onsite interview. Phone interview is asking my background and experience, while onsite interview is 30 minutes intense real coding question on white board. Two questions were given in the onsite interview. 1st one is reversing a linked list, and the 2nd one is writing a…  regular expression parser. However, since it only allowed 30 minutes to write actual codes for both questions, I wasn't able to finish them. (I finished 1 and 2nd one is half way) I then never got the reply from them.

3 rounds of phone interview for a winter internship.

A FB HR person contacted me out of the blue directly. Everything was quick and well thought-through. It really looks like they interview tons of people a day and have an industrial interview process. After a brief HR phone chat, I was given a choice of a phone interview or a brief onsite - chose the latter.

Since I had some industry experience, after my phone screens, I had the full onsite interview loop. All interviews involve some coding, but they vary in how much:- 2 ninja (coding) interviews. These are garden-variety programming interviews and can be prepped pretty much the same way you'd prep for Google or any other major software company.- 1 jedi (engineering fit) interview. The jedi is designed to assess whether you'll thrive…  in Facebook's engineering team. You'll talk about problems you've worked through in the past, engineering decisions you've made, and so forth. You'll likely do some coding, too.- 1 pirate (engineering design) interview. If you're in the product-engineering bucket, you'll probably be asked to design a user-facing product; the interview will range from actual coding to high-level design considerations. New-grad hires (people without significant industry experience) will generally not have pirates.

A phone interview was scheduled after the initial exchange of emails with the recruiter. There were some background questions asked such as "Why Facebook" and "Tell me about an interesting project you have worked on". The rest of the interview consisted of algorithms/data structures questions, with the interviewer trying to dig as deep into every question.

A recruiter found my resume online and emailed me asking if I would be interested in opportunities with Facebook. We then spoke on the phone and she scheduled my first technical interview. Throughout the process the HR person was very friendly and helpful.The technical interviews were conducted using Skype and collabedit.com. They consisted mostly of algorithms and data structures questions, and a few questions about projects I had mentioned on…  my resume. The first two interviewers were very friendly and positive, and I felt the interviews went very well, having answered all the questions correctly. The last interview was conducted by a grumpy engineer with a thick accent who was running 15 minutes late and sounded like he didn't want to be there. Unfortunately this put me off quite a bit, and I did not perform very well in that interview, 3 days later I heard back from HR that they wouldn't be proceeding with on-site interviews in Palo Alto.

A phone screen followed by 4 onsite interviews.The interviews were mostly about coding which I liked, the interviewers were very open about their likes and dislikes in facebook and helped sell the place.The recruiters were great in keeping me in the loop and giving me the status and eventually the offer.

Recruiter emailed me long time back in 2009, but I was not available at that time. I started to look for different opportunities earlier this year and contacted their recruiter. The recruiter filtered my email so I waited several months without any response, however with the help from my friend at Facebook finally I was able to contact the recruiter in mid-March. I had two phone interviews with them, the…  first one went well but second one stumbled me. Then I get rejected after 2-3 days.

They had a booth at my college job fair. I gave them my resume, and had a 1:1 interview at my college the day after. They called me at night to tell me I had made it trough the first interview and that they wanted to see me again. It went well so they invited me to Palo Alto for an on-site interview.It was my first interview, so I might…  have been too stressed to think straight, but I feel like some questions were pretty hard. The first interviewers (they were 2) asked me easy questions, but the second (he gave no feedback at all) and the third interviewers asked hard questions. The last interviewer asked me: define a function that computes log2(). I gave him the Taylor expansion, and a newton's method approach, but he wanted something else... He wanted me to use sqrt(). I'm not sure whether he was assessing my skills at finding a solution given a weird constraint (e.g., use sqrt()), or if there is an obvious solution that I missed.

HR phone interview, in-house coding interview. ull-time software candidates in USA. Submitted resume at college career fair. Got email about on-campus interviews. At this stage, there are 3 possible outcomes: onsite invitation, a phone interview for an additional chance, or reject. I was invited to onsite interview.Onsite was a "University Day" that included three interviews (not four like they said in the email) before lunch and then a tour, new-hire…  panel, etc after lunch.

General background questions. Then proceeded to coding on CollabEdit. Fairly standard CS questions. Got to ask questions at the end.The interviewer was very courteous and pleasant to work with. Didn't quibble over the obvious, but time consuming, details.

Sourced through a friend who works there, really good communication and speed.I totally bombed an initial on-site but then was able to get another one. Studied up for it, did a lot better and then went on-site for a full day.Got to meet a lot of awesome engineers, guess I did okay since I got an offer and it was the best day of my life!

My resume was submitted by an employee. I got a call from recruiter next day, she was nice and explained me the process, then scheduled me for phone interview within same week. She was nice enough to provide some interview tips, so I had chance to review some topics. I think fb recruiters are totally on your side.The phone interviewer was a very nice guy, he was definitely not a…  recent graduate like some other poster complained, he talked about the pre-internet boom days, so I think he has least 15 years experience.The phone screen took 45 mins.First 10-15 mins, he asked about my background and why it's a good match for the position, why I want to work in FB.Then I was asked to coding question to "find minimum depth of a binary search tree". It was not a hard question, any average coder could do it within 15 mins.I wrote the code with no hint or help from him. During the coding, he was mostly quite, at one point, he pointed out a possible bug which I fixed instantly. At the end, I was trying to optimize the code, he said the code would work, no need to optimize it further. Then he let me ask questions about FB about 15 mins.After the interview, I compiled the code and it really worked, didn't even have a single compile error.Next day, I received a rejection letter from the recruiter with no details.So trick is, writing the code is not enough, but your code must be very close the most optimized version known and you should be able to write 'close to perfect' code in minimum time.I googled for similar algorithms and found out my solution was well above the average, but not the best one. I guess they expect you to write something very close to best available code possible can be written, so they single out best coders.So 'move fast, break things'..

The first interview is an easy programming question where mostly everyone can pass to the next round.The second interview was a little bit harder using recursion to generate all possible words doing DFS backtracking. The interviewers are not very friendly.

First I had a phone interview. The question was fairly straight-forward (multiply two very large numbers given as Strings) and the interviewer wasn't looking for any tricks or anything like that to solve. Like others have mentioned, quick clean code seems to be the key. Unfortunately, the interviewer had a very thick East Asian accent and talking over the phone just made things worse. I had to ask him to…  repeat quite a few times. It was probably me but at times I couldn't even tell when he'd asked a question because of the inflection! It must've gone well enough though because I got an on-site call.The on-site was two interviews of 45 min each. In the first one, I took a bit of a hit because a) I couldn't see the solution right away b) it took me a while to get up to speed and code the thing - I did manage to finish it though and it seemed (relatively) bug-free. Again, as lots of people have mentioned, the interviewer seemed quite young, just a year or so out of school and he didn't offer much in terms of feedback - positive or negative - as the interview progressed. Once he'd given me the question and given me the hint that got me started, he was busy with his iPhone, rarely looking up. That kinda sucked.The second interviewer was much nicer - probably one of the best ones I've interviewed with - lots of feedback, lots of encouragement, was accepting of different trains of thought and non-standard answers. Seemed like a really nice guy too.Overall, it seems to be the case with Facebook thata) Your interview really depends on who you getb) They seem to value quick-clean-bug free-optimized code at the first try more than anything elsec) Questions are of average to above-average difficulty (if you've prepared!)

HR contacted through Linked in. And then had a 1:1 45 min interview setup at Palo Alto HQ.

The rumours about the hiring process being haphazard are true. First a manager phone screened me and asked me to come to Palo Alto. Next the recruiter told me I stll need to go through a phone screen. If the disconnect stopped there it would have been OK. I did not expect to get invited to Palo Alto without a tech screen.Here's the kicker. I am a senior engineer in…  my present job. The person who phone screened me was a fresh college hire and had spent about 1 month working at facebook. Facebook was that person's first job. I am not saying a new hire cannot be smarter than a senior person, but it is reasonable to think that it would be a good practice at a big company to allow new hires especially fresh out of school to settle down, understand the needs of the company and then start interviewing people.

I had on campus interviews in the spring and then decided to interview for full time in the fall. I had three interviews - the first went very well, the second was terrible, the third was alright. The terrible interviewer asked some basic technical questions involving writing code on the board. As I thought out loud, I asked the interviewer clarification questions and then ultimately asked whether I should start…  writing code on the board. The interviewer either did not respond to my questions or mumbled off a few incomprehensible words. I started writing code and as soon as I stepped back from the board, the interviewer pointed out my mistake without giving me a chance to assess the code myself. He did this an another two times for the subsequent questions.Overall, the questions were not difficult at all. It seems that Facebook wants to make sure that you code frequently enough that you do not make any errors on your first hack at a problem. This seems to fit the "go fast and break things" motto. Although things didn't work out for me, I got an offer from Google, so I guess that's not a bad second choice.

1st round HR screening2nd round coding online3rd round coding onlineThe 1st and 2nd rounds are great. However, the 3rd one is terrible since the guy on the other end of phone is keeping silent and provided little feedback during the whole process.Basically I think they are more interested in find the people who can do tricky programs in a very short period of time while keeping solid code and clean…  coding style.The HR is very fast in turnaround, though the final decision is kind of be kept back for a while, but if you ask they will let you know. Anyway, this is the first company I got interview so maybe it is just too difficult for a rookie interviewee.BTW, I though Chinese engineers tend to be more silent in interview, which is sort of "rude" to the interviewee since there is not much conversation in such case.

I was referred to Facebook by a friend and the hiring recruiter emailed me the next day. He asked for the resume saying that he will send it over to the hiring manager. Next day, the recruiter asked for the convenient days and time to call, and called me the following day. He explained the hiring process, asked me about myself and what I did/do.Then, a week later, I had…  technical phone interview with a FB employee. We had a session in Google Docs set up. She first asked me about myself a little and asked one technical question. I had to write C/C++ code in Google Docs while explaining what I do on the phone.It was quite hard actually. Not even the question itself but the whole experience, you feel bad if you make a typo (and i did many silly typos that I usually do not make when writing code), because she can see your typing in real time. Also, you cannot debug or anything.. In the end, to understand my idea of a solution, she gave me an example input and asked to traverse it using my code. After getting an idea she said, ok, almost correct, you could find a bug in 10 mins, ya, but we gotta end now.Next day the original recruiter emailed me saying that they wouldn't take me. It seems they needed the correct solution and code to be done on the fly in 25 mins.

Was originally contact by a recruiter over LinkedIn.I had a phone interview, followed by a visit to a Facebook recruiting event where I met with an engineer in-person, followed by another phone screen, followed by an on-site in Palo Alto with 4 members of the engineering staff.The whole process seemed somewhat disorganized, I was informed after my recruiting event visit that I would be getting an on-site as the next…  step, but was informed a couple of days later that I'd have to do another phone screen first.The questions in the screens and the onsite seemed reasonable enough. I'll admit to having somewhat of an off-day at the on-site. I completely fumbled the "are there any bugs in your code" question with at least one of the interviewers; I said there wasn't, but there was a pretty obvious bug once he described the failure mode to me.There was a scheduling mix-up with at least one of my interviewers, which caused my time with him to be cut short. I'm sure that didn't help with him getting a good feel for me for the sake of his interview feedback.The culture seems a bit more corporatey than the recruiting buzz might put forward; it seems geared toward people who want to have one foot in the startup pond while having the other firmly planted on the dry land of large, relatively safe organization. There are a lot of small teams, and the reflection I got is that there is a non-negligible amount of bureaucracy weighing on the organization. I guess when you get to 1000 people, that will happen.The office space is a mostly open floor plan, and the gear the developers are provided to work on is really good stuff.But that's an initial impression, and things are not always as they appear.So yeah, weirdness in the interview scheduling and such dragged down my impression, but I'd probably give the dice another roll if the chance comes up again. If nothing else, it will allow me a second glimpse to either bolster or contradict my first impressions.

Asked me about myself and some simple technical questions. Decided I should not go on.

I was contacted by a recruiter out of the blue based on my web presence. I went through three phone interviews, then an on-site. Every single interview was exactly the same format: the interviewer gives me two or three programming problems and asked me to solve them in my language of choice in front of him on a whiteboard (or virtual whiteboard). No behavioral interview, and the only contact I…  had with the HR chicks was "OMG you should work here."

I was referred by a friend working @ facebook. The recruiter first gave a phone call to discuss my background. Then a phone interview was scheduled a week later. In the phone interview, it was a guy working on some system projects. He first asked me a few general tech questions. Then he let me to code a program to check if a given string is matching a given regular…  expression online using collabedit. I didn't do well. So there is no feedback T_T

Had an initial phone interview with the recruiter. That was followed by two technical phone interviews.First technical interview went really well. The dude was really professional. The second interviewer had an accent that was difficult to understand but other than that, it was a good interview.I feel Facebook interview process is weird, in spite of doing well you may get rejected.

Although the result doesn't come yet. I guess it must fail. I only complete one question in the phone interview: reverse linked list in java.I forget that linked list ends with null...

First, 3 phone screens. Talk about your previous work and interested, then solve algorithmic problems. They are usually not very hard. After that, onsite with ~5 interviews of the similar type.

This was a telephone interview where the person was very terse and looking for very specific answers.

Got email from a recruiter in response to the resume I sent them. We set up a phone call between the recruiter and me for him to (I guess) do some initial screening. Next stop was a phone interview with an engineer and it was tough. I guess I should have reviewed some CS beforehand.

I was contacted via email by HR saying that my friend had recommended I be interviewed for a spot at the company. I was pretty surprised by this, but have found that this is how Facebook often goes about doing things. We scheduled an interview for a few days later, which I thought was going to be a technical interview. When I got on the phone with the interview he…  asked me about what I've been working on recently, and so I got into this whole thing about my research project which I probably took a good 10 - 15 minutes describing. He basically just verbally nodded through the whole thing. He then asked me about what positions I was interested in interviewing for at Facebook. In my push to prepare for what I was expecting to be a technical interview, I somehow neglected to actually figure out what specifically I could work on at Facebook. I mentioned doing something with the large data sets they work on, since my research focused somewhat loosely on large-scale data analysis. Should have prepped for that one, but no problem. He then told me that he'd be happy to set me up for a phone interview with an engineer as soon as possible and I was like "whaa?! I thought you were one!". Not actually, but I did say that I'd be happy to interview with an engineer and so he got that set up for me. I'll come back and post once I've had my *actual* technical interview (instead of just an HR sanity check)

Multiple interviews. Very heavy CS/discrete math based questions. They are definitely hiring only the smartest people! Also, long waits between interviews. Other than that, they were very professional and employees were open in sharing their experience while working at Facebook (lots of energy and enthusiasm in general, mostly because its a lot of young/college kids)

I had 2 telephonic interviews and the questions are below. Recruiters are pretty cool in facebook.1. General Resume stuff.2. Merge Sort - Write code for it. Complexity.3. SQL - self join: Asked me to write a query, don't remember the exact question.4. Advantage of B Trees - Used in databases for indexing. Adv. Less number of memory lookups because of less hierarchy. Large fanout.

facebook is an unprofessional company to interview with. The first phone interviewer only wanted some insider information regarding my company (which I didn't give to him). The second interviewer could not get the interviewing tool working! He wasted 1/2 hour of my time before calling and telling me he would like to reschedule. So I patiently rescheduled with HR for the next day. The 2nd interviewer now calls 20 minutes…  late. Is fairly rude and capricious. Says that he is in a hurry. Did not explain his problem correctly. When I explained my solution, quickly tacked on some additional requirements and then said my solution did not work. The interview only lasted about 15 minutes. Said that he worked on consistency problems at facebook. Everybody knows how horrible the facebook newsfeed consistency is. Total time wasted with these people = 4hours (over two weeks, not including recruiter time). Compensation offered for my time; none. Conclusion: run as fast as you can from this company.

Recruiter contacted me . I had just put up my resume on the website, didn't solve any kind of programming puzzle. In the first phone interview, I was asked to write a program that - given an array, would print the largest subarray that had elements in increasing order.

Interview consisted of a phone interview and then an all-day on-site interview with four one hour interviews. I was really impressed by the difficulty of the questions that they asked and the level of thinking and coding they expected. After the interview, I wasn't sure if I would be happy working at facebook so they let me come back and speak with me would-be manager and director as well as…  some coworkers so I could make a good decision.

Did a phone screen on Friday to discuss with Facebook was working on and what I wanted to work on. This moved to Onsite technical interview on following Tuesday, they moved quickly because of another pending offer with another company. Did well, Then moved to meet with more members of the team on Thursday, moved to offer on Friday and then accepted within 1 day.

Phone interview was very professional and well structured. Covered a broad range of topics in computer science. Then I was called on site which consisted of many more rounds of interview with in-depth focus on algorithms and systems knowledge. There seemed to be a focus on an understanding of performance of systems.

The interview consisted of two parts.The first part was a basic screening my the HR person through a set of e-mail questions regarding preferences of work, technology experience, etc. The second part consisted of a phone conversation with one of the the Facebook engineers where he asked questions regarding current employment responsibilities, why the interest in Facebook, etc. He then proceeded to ask a simple technical question which you had…  to provide a solution for on the spot through a web application from which he could see you typing (a bit nerve wrecking).

I applied online through the Facebook website and heard back from HR within 2 weeks. After speaking with the recruiter, we setup a phone interview with one of the engineers. The phone interview was about 20 minutes long and consisted of 2 questions which were algorithmic in nature, one of which was reversing a linked list. I heard back from them about a week later and we setup a time…  for an on-site interview. I was alotted $1000USD for travel expenses to travel from Toronto, ON to Palo Alto, CA. The on-site interview lasted 4 hours and was split up into 1 hour interviews with a different engineer. The questions were mostly abstract, and language independent. Content of the questions varied from riddles to database design. My impression of the first three engineers was good, they seemed like nice guys, and knowledgeable. The last interviewer came off as pretentious, I felt as though he wanted me to fail -- just my opinion!Overall, the office culture seemed relaxed and the problems they are solving there are interesting ones. I'd recommend interviewing with them if only for the chance to visit Palo Alto!

Pretty superficial compared to the in-depth interviews I've had for many other employees in Silicon Valley and otherwise in high tech. I was astonished that they seemed nonplussed at the prospect of somebody weaving back and forth between (very senior) individual contributor and (technical) manager -- that cluelessness is something I expect from big old ossified companies, but this "weaving" pattern is perfectly normal and expected in young dynamic up-and-coming…  hi-tech outfits (hey, I've been doing this for decades;-).

A recruiter contacted me and I preformed a brief initial interview and then setup a follow-up interview with manager of engineering who gave an online interactive interview. The interview consisted of typing into a web-browser sudo-code solutions to various engineering questions.

After successful skype interview I came onsite. There were 4 stages, warmup session, 2 explicit coding sessions and one design session.I was overstressed and terribly performed during warmup session, next 2 were normal and the last was ok.Interviewers were friendly enough, they tried their best to help me overcome my stress.

I've got reached back by an email in few days after i applied online, i later got rejected after a behavioral phone call which i got a few days later.

I applied online through the Facebook website. The recruiter emailed me to schedule phone screen. During the phone screen the recruiter was reading through my resume and asked me about some of my projects. I also got asked what area I'm interested in working on.

1. HR interview - HR calls you and ask you questions about you and tell you about the process2. Phone screen - On a specific time you connect to a remote code panel, and code for around 35 min3. 4 interviews on-site - you have 3-4 Tech interviews and one Software Design (as a graduate you don't have this part)

I had a colleague from my recent summer internship talk to his friend who worked at Facebook refer me. About a week later a recruiter reached out to me to schedule a phone interview.I had 3 interviews in total. The first one was an initial screening interview over the phone with the recruiter where we simply went over my CV for 30 minutes.A few days later she scheduled a Skype…  interview with an engineer from Menlo Park. The interview was technical and I managed to solve 1 question just about on time, with a few minutes left for questions for the engineer before he had to run off.I was surprised to see the next morning that they wanted to move forward and schedule a 2nd interview with me. This time it would be with another engineer but over video conference. The interviewer was very kind and gave me a hint when I was moving in the wrong direction with my solution. Again, I managed to solve the solution just about on time with a few minutes left for questions.

I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter to set up an interview, after having dropped my resume for the company at a tech conference. Had one technical phone interview that went well and was booked for another interview. The second interview was okay, but I was given a third phone interview and rejected afterwards.

Got a call from a recruiter at Facebook. Very helpful and they motivate you to try and get through the process easily. They give you books, links, courses, etc which could be helpful for appearing in the interview. He told me about the interview process in details.The initial screening started from the same round and I was asked a few basic questions about Android. Assuming you need to clear x/…  8-9 questions that were being asked.Then the round was with a developer from facebook which was for around 45-60 mins.The only problem that I faced in the process was that I didn't get any feedback so that I can atleast prepare and appear again for the interview. While I was atleast expecting a feedback for the same.

The recruiter, and the everyone involved in setting up the phone interview was great. The interviewer was nice as well ... but I was kind of misled.I was asked two questions, I got through the first one quickly, and then was asked a second. I realized I was going about the solution wrong, and figured out the best way to do it with 5 minutes left and described it, and…  he agreed that that was the best solution. I told the interviewer I could probably code the correct solution in the 5 minutes I had left, but he said we can just chat about what working at FB is like, and that since this is just the first phone screen I don't have to code the correct solution he's happy that I figured it out.A day later the recruiter told me I didn't get past the first phone screen .. Then why didn't the interviewer just let me finish...

Had one 45 minute phone interview with an engineer. The interviewer was very disinterested, wasn't paying attention to what I was doing and was loudly typing the entire time. It left a bad taste in my mouth. Now that I have had other interviews at big tech companies I see that this experience was an anomaly because other interviewers were engaged, pointing out bugs and asking questions, whereas my interviewer…  silently sat there the whole time. I'm extremely disappointed in the way I was treated

I gave my resume at the career fair and got a phone interview. The interviewer started with couple behavioral questions but it was mostly coding. I thought I didn't do great but they invited me to an onsite interview. The interviewer was really nice and I was able to (more or less) solve two questions but didn't get an offer in the end.

It's not an interview really, but a series of tests.Approached by a recruiter, had a phone conversation and then an on-site coding test (could also have been done by phone, but I live nearby). After another phone conversation with a recruiter who explained the process, came into their office for another series of four tests - 2 more coding tests, a design question and one with some vague personal questions…  and YACT (Yet Another Coding Test). Questions are not too difficult, but I'm assuming they expect near-perfect performance (mine was not :)Everyone was very friendly, positive and respectful, so even though I was rejected, all in all a positive experience - as someone often involved in recruiting myself, I think we can all learn a lot from how it's done there, especially when it comes to giving candidates a good feeling, regardless of outcome.

Facebook came to our college for hiring of interns on the campus. The process included one coding round. It was carried out through Hacckerrank platform. I couldn't make it to interview round but those who did were screened with 2 telephonic interviews. There was only one question in coding round which was to be done in one hour.There was resume shortlisting after that. Those who were shortlisted were called for…  interviews.

I was referred by an employee and got the interview. It was a 45 minutes phone interview. At the beginning we had some talk about my background and programming competitions. Everything was pretty nice. After that I had 4 tasks and all of them were pretty standart, so I've solved every of them (see below).I didn't get an answer for a week (that was pretty strange because my friend who…  had not very good first interview got an invite for a second interview on the next day after his first, and also my recruiter said that I have to finish both interviewes till mid October, my first interview was on 29th of September and we didn't have a lot of time). When I asked my recrutier about the result she said that interviewer haven't sent result yet (it's been one week and we had a cut off date!). So, in four days I've asked my recruiter again and she replied that they won't be moving forward with my candidacy.So I don't know what was the problem, but I really want to believe that it's not because of interviewer's irresponsibility and cut off time.

phone interview with recruiter, then phone interview with one programming questionthe process was quick and fair. they were super nice the whole time and didn't stall with the final answer

Started with a technical test on Hackerrank, then a series of technical phone interview.Then, you were given a call from HR about the interview process.During the technical phone interview, the phone line was terrible and the engineer interviewing had an accent, making it hard to understand.

I was approached by a recruiter and asked to have a chat after which they promptly set up an interview without even asking me if I wanted to go ahead. Quite aggressive. I then had a remote coding interview with someone from the US office who didn't really bother telling me where they were located. He had a heavy south Indian accent that I could barely understand and seemed more…  interested in talking about himself and his job at Facebook than asking about my current role. He was unable to explain the problem at hand well enough for me to understand and when I asked probing questions he repeated himself like a broken record. For example when he asked me the space complexity, I was working under the assumption that he wanted me to make a copy of the data structure. I work mostly with immutable data so a copy is normal. He seemed surprised at my answer and we went back and forth until I finally figured out he was expecting me to modify it in place. I later found out his English language ability was quite poor as I asked him some basic non-technical questions and he asked me what certain words meant. He also cut me off while I was trying to explain my solution to him and proceeded to give me the solution which I thought was rather unfair. I guess at that point he failed me already.

Got contacted from linkedIn.First I got a quick phone call with easy multiple option questions.Then I got two phone interviews, where you had to code some algorithms.Then I went to the onsite interview, where 4 interviews are held during one day. One focused on personal resume, one of design, and two focused on algorithms and brain teasers.

Contacted by Linked In, Phone Interview, Phone coding interview, Onsite InterviewsIt was a great experience, It was for an Android Role in Menlo Park. It's a grat company with great engineers.

First they reach out by email, then we schedule a phone interview to get to know me, then a remote coding interview and finally 5 interviews at Facebook Hiring event.

I was contacted via mail, a recruiter saw my linked in profile, over the phone he had a few basic iOS questions, after that I had another phone Interview with "live coding" again, some iOS questions, this time not so basic and a few problems to solve in the editor. At the end I had an Interview in person with 4 different guys. Mainly solving code problems on a whiteboard…  and few general questions. One of the interviews was about Architecture, that one was the toughest for me, because I never did something like that, In general I never had an Interview process like this.

I applied online to a software engineer intern in Tel-Aviv.first I had a general phone interview about my experience,knowledge,why I want to work at facebook and etc, And few days later online coding test.

1 online interview and then 5 interviews at their offices in telaviv. Each interview contained 1 technical question. All interview required to write code. One interview was also HR interview and one was design.

It's took one week , I got a call from consultancy they said there is a opening in facebook (contract) and payslips by name of that consultancy. This role is for python developer most likely to work on Python, SQL, Binary search trees.

They were very nice. First I was contacted by a girl that said she will pass my C.V on. Afterwards a guy who was in the same field area as of me interviewed me. All the interaction was on the phone.

Two rounds of white board technical interview. There was a meet and greet to get acquainted with the interviewers. They were pretty nice. One was from an Ivy league school and the other was from Europe. Barely, anyone who interviewed with the Ivy league employee made it to the next round

After passing the phone interview (easy questions with the + and *), i was invited to the on-site interviews. one non tech and two tech. the non tech also had a technical question, not an easy one. two more technical interviews followed. not too difficult questions, yet complicated and if you're off by a bit they will probably not let you pass. i gave good solutions to all questions yet…  it took me a bit of extra time and some confusion in between, and they did not accept me.I recommend everyone that prepares to just go over all questions, you can be getting the easy ones and fail them because you practiced too hard on the difficult ones. true story.

Applied online. Was contacted by hiring manager for detail verification, then scheduled a phone interview where I had to answer a question on a shared editor. The interviewer explained about himself, and the team he was in. Gave a good feeling throughout the interview.

The interview involved a typical face to face whiteboard question. Pretty easy question although I started off with a correct but non-optimal algorithm. Then with some help implemented a lower complexity algorithm.Apparently starting off with a non-optimal solution is not acceptable, and syntax errors are also major issues so we didn't proceed to a second round.

I received an email about scheduling a 45 min interview. This was my first so I was not ready. You don't go through HR screening, but your first interview is right off the bat technical. I was given one question to solve via an online code editor that could be run, it had some faulty issues that wasted time and made me more nervous. I couldn't solve the question before…  time was up and wasn't offered a second interview. Interviewer was very nice though.

I was contacted by a recruiter to an on-campus interview. Interview lasted about 45 min. Had to solve 1 problem and some behavioral questions (Favorite project, Why facebook, where I see myself), overall I felt I did not prepare enough, I solved the problem correctly but It took me some time to make it optimal.

First, there is a screening call with HR. They tell you all about the recruiting process : - 1st round: a video interview with 3 parts (for a total of 30-45 minutes): 1 – Analytical Interview 2 – Technical Data 3 – Math - 2nd round (if you pass the 1st round): same kind of interview with 5 persons in Menlo Park.

I applied through an employee referral. They have returned to me very quickly in mail with few questions regarding my background. Second interview was on the phone with HR recruiter. Also, background check and some easy technical questions. Third interview was video-screening with one of the employees. I've asked to write a code and answer algorithm question.

Facebook visited our campus and gave practice mock interviews which I felt were really useful since I have never been exposed to a technical interview before.The interviewer was really nice and helped me on the way. In addition, he looked over my resume and gave me tips on how I could improve it.

Interview via Skype after having contact with a recruiter. I met the recruiter at a programming camp in Latin America. First I had a Skype meeting with the recruiter and then I had one with one engineer. The test with the engineer was via Skype and using a common IDE, so he can see what I was writing.

I originally had applied to Facebook through their online portal. After a few weeks of no response I reached out to a recruiter at a Facebook event and she saw my resume. After I convinced her I was ready for the interviews, she set up my first phone interview of three total.After the interviewer gave a fairly long intro of his bg I was asked several behavioral questions. I was…

Was contacted by Facebook recruiter via LinkedIn. I had never considered applying at Facebook but the positions mentioned seemed interesting. Phone screen with a person not on the team I was applying to. Asked questions that have been mentioned here many times over several years. Took over two weeks after the screen to get any feedback.

Contacted the university recruiter on FB and booked an interview. Warning: The recruiter tends to be forgetful or maybe has a lot on his plate, I had to remind him several times to book the interview and always check back. I would recommend everyone do the same lest you drop off the radar.

Recruitment team came to the university to present the process and offer contacts. I contacted the recruiter via e-mail, and got an answer within 2 weeks. Had an initial phone screen on which the recruiter asked me questions about my background and interests on the company. The recruiter also presented the recruiting process, and scheduled me for a technical interview via Skype.The technical interview took about 45 minutes. At the…  beginning, the interviewer asked me about interesting projects that I have been worked on, and then went to the technical question. I can't give the question due to the NDA, but it was a basic question about strings handling.After one week I got the response that I didn't pass the interview. I asked for feedback, but the recruiter told me that it was on their policy to not give feedback to the candidates... =/

Was approached by a recruiter on LinkedIn, who organised a phone call to discuss the interview process. After initial introductions, I was ambushed by questions about my salary, followed by an impromptu programming interview. The line quality was quite poor, which combined with the interviewer's accent made it difficult to understand the questions, which didn't really matter because by that point I'd already decided not to go ahead with the…  process

HR assistant sent material to get prepared for the phone interview.Phone and live coding interview with a tech manager. The task was not an easy one and the interviewer was very helpful.

After submitting my resume and answering a few questions on past projects, job preferences, etc. I had two Skype interviews on algorithmic questions. The problems posed were quite fair and had to be solved in a programming language of choice in an online editor. After that, I was invited to an on-site interview in London (expenses paid) with three more one on one interviews. Two of them were once more…  on coding, this time on a white board. The other one also had a small coding part but also included questions on previous projects, team behavior etc.

Everyone was really cool, got 3 interviews, one of which was partly technical and partly non-technical. The non-technical interview also has a small coding part at the end. The two others can be either completely coding or 1-coding and 1-design. The questions were all ones I hadn't seen before after practicing for a while, but I mostly found them simple-to-average difficulty, except one which was pretty tough, that I managed…  to crack a couple minutes in.

Facebook rounds are purely on Technical.Each round they will ask to write some program in preferred language which you have choose. Mine was SQL and Python.Be prepare with how to write effective code.There will be many logical Q as well.Interview happen around total 6 rounds.Bad luck at last no offer.Selection process took around 1 month.3 Indian round + 1 Singapore client + 2 US rounds

Stage one was a phone screen, clearly intended to give them a feel for whether I can think on my feet or not.Then, a full day of interviews in the office - mixture of coding and culture fit interviews, where the culture fit interviews were done by underrepresented groups, and the coding interviews were mixed. Again, very clear that the goal was to get me a chance to sink or…  swim on my own merits.Coding interviews were split between coding on laptop and coding on whiteboard, to give me a chance to come back if I can't code on a whiteboard.That came back unsure, so I came in for one last interview session.

First interview was HR phone interview, with 3 simple technical questions.Second interview was technical over the phone with one of the employees. the interview was on shared online whiteboard.overall process was very good, people are very nice and helpful.during the interview, the interviewer gives you tips and directions, always focus about what you are doing.

Started off with a basic screening test from a recruiter, basic programming questions that your really should know.This was followed by two 1 hour Skype interviews, both interviews consisted of 1 programming question and then 15 mins chatting. The questions at this stage are very basic (arrays).Final stage was onsite interview, 4 back to back interviews, these were a lot harder but with good revision easily passed. Just make sure…  you know your data structures and basic algorithms.Overall best interview experience ever! everyone is amazing and you leave knowing this is the place you really want to work!

I took a phone interview of Facebook in April last year, it's a phone interview, we talk on phone and type code on the Google doc. Firstly they ask me do a self introduction, I talked about my experience and projects, then they ask me some questions related to my resume. This last about 10 minutes. After that I did 2 algorithm question. I think they pay more attention on…  the coding test. The whole interview may last about 40 minutes.

They do not make the things difficult and they can see the situation from student's end. Very fast and convenient hiring process. They reply emails very accurately and very fast.

The first interview was with recruiter and gone very well. Recruiter told about company and opportunities of working there. The he asked about my experience and willing to join the team.The second (tech) interview started from describing technical part of one of my favorite projects I was involved in. Then interviewer asked me to solve algorithmic problem.After that I didn't hear anything from facebook stuff even tried to write them…  month later...

I applied throw the Facebook career website. The process took about 2 weeks and consisted of a questionnaire, a phone call with the recruiter, and 45 minutes interview by phone (phone screen). All the process took place mostly by email. In addition, couple of days before the interview the recruiter invite me to an online video session with other applicants.

Here's my opinion from my experience interviewing at Facebook.They tell you the process in advance. One phone interview, 5 in house interviews (3 coding, 1 design and 1 behavioural). All interviews are 45 minutes each and one-on-one, and you have to write code in all of the coding interviews, and possibly in the design one too. In the first round, one person decides whether you get through or not. In…  the 5 rounds, each interviewer provides their feedback after you have finished the interviews which means that if you do badly in one then the other interviewers won't actually know.Be fully aware, and make no mistake about this - there is an incredibly high possibility that you will get rejected. That sounds harsh but consider it from their position - huge numbers of people apply, huge numbers get interviewed, and they have to pick people out somehow. They also say that they prefer to avoid hiring the wrong person so ultimately they end up inadvertantly rejecting good candidates incase they turn out to be a bad hire, so the risk of getting rejecting is even higher. Basically, this means you are most likely going to be wasting a ridiculous amount of your time and effort. Perhaps because of this, they are incredibly nice and friendly. This really was the nicest and most pleasant interview I have had.Also, once you understand the scenario, it really helps to kill your nerves if you suffer from that. After all, why stress about something you have practically no chance of succeeding in? Negative, true, but the odds are really stacked against you and you would do well to understand that and just be yourself.The questions are not that hard, I found. In fact, I solved the first one so quickly I even surprised myself. You do have to write on the whiteboard, but that of course means that there can not be much code to write since a whiteboard is not that big. Indeed the questions are not that hard really. I felt that they do expect you to talk about what you are doing but also to get it right very quickly and without any mistakes. They want to see how you approach the problem etc., but get real - they don't want to see you fumbling around, they want to see that you know the answer and can bang it out.Ultimately, even if you know the answer to the technical questions and you get them right you will still likely fail over something you can't really control or even know about. In my case, they said I didn't have management experience, but you know what, I didn't apply for a manager role and they never even asked about management or leadership at all. I was pretty annoyed to be honest, it felt like a complete waste of my time and I felt like an idiot for worrying so much about the interviews.They do provide you with some preparation links which are useful. There is also a book called Cracking The Coding Interview. It doesn't have their questions in it of course, but it gives you plenty of examples on how to solve these kinds of questions so if you read up on it you should be able to bang them out quite easily.Overall, it is worth going just to see if you can handle it because you probably can! Just make sure that you feel good about what you achieved even if they say no.

I got the interview from the campus recruitment was generally a positive experience. I was asked to code on a whiteboard in front of the interviewer after being asked about my interests . the questions were not too tough and the response was encouraging but I didnt make it . not sure why .

No different to others mentioned here: contacted via LinkedIn, one screening call (45mins), then on-site with 4 x 45mins interviews.Overall, the algorithm questions are not particularly hard. I have interviewed with FB twice, and both times felt the sessions went well (although considerably better the second time), but no offer either time. You won't get detailed enough feedback to know where you might have tripped up, if anywhere, though. From…  their point of view, I think this is understandable, but makes it harder to deal with the rejection; if you had fouled up every session you would feel better than if you basically answered all the questions, with seemingly positive feedback from each interviewer, yet not got an offer...As noted elsewhere, it's probably best to be stoic about the whole thing and accept that they have so many candidates they probably apply a "benefit of the doubt" policy that works against in their favour; ie. I would imagine they employ a sort of "thumb up", "thumb down" policy.They are, however, very pleasant and expect to have a positive experience of the process even if the result is not what you might want yourself.

There were four interviews, two about engineering, one about architecture, one about career. The engineering interviews where what you would expect: The questions were geared to find out whether you understand time and space complexity. The hardest one was the architecture part, because it was not obvious to me what to prepare there. Facebook is such a huge company, doing architecture on Facebook scale is something that I think only…  Facebook or one of the other big companies can prepare you to do. The career one was kind of a pleasant chat.

Phone interview, engineer was very nice but kind of awkward because he would't speak loud and was very difficult to communicate while programming and not being able to listen to his comments. Overall it was very interesting and helpful interview. They try to help you throughout the process and are very quick to answer emails and questions

The internship application process was this: Resume Submission --> HR email requesting more information: grades sheet (I'm a CS student), if I were to join FB what would interest me most to be working on, location preferences etc. --> HR 10min Screening --> 45m Technical Phone Interview (if good --> 45m Technical On-Site Interview).

I applied to the company via employee referral. The process took 2 weeks. Was contacted by HR professional who briefed about available positions. Interview took place one week later. It was not very tough the questions were modified a bit, but were workable. Overall moderate process

I was applying to Facebook through a friend that is working there. I was first contacted by a recruiter who asked some technical questions.I was next contacted only 2 weeks later and a phone interview was set.The question was relatively easy, but I was stressed and couldn't think of a way to make it more efficient.

one 45 minutes coding interview via phone. the interviewer was nice and asked guiding questions. asked at the end for complexity and what could be done to improve the code.

Got contacted by recruiter, two round of telephone interview, then onsite. Several days later, references requested and all feedback will be gathered to hiring manager. Then decision.The questions usually are not hard. The interviewer will give hints when you stuck.

Quick interview process. I was contacted by the facebook recruiter, followed by a technical interview, where at first I had to answer questions about my previous jobs / projects and implement a couple of algorithms on whiteboard.

Telephone Interview followed by on-site. Process was exceptionally well managed and very well thought through and very efficient. Interview presented an excellent impression of the company and the people who work there. Never had a process that completed so quickly and with so little friction. Highly recommended. Would happily interview again! :)

From university. two phone interviews, then onsite interviews with 3 rounds. the whole process was very nice. But the one of the employee was not good.

The recruiter contacted me via LinkedIn. I had no prior interview experience. She was helpful and responsive. We had a phone call and she explained me the process. Two weeks later I had my phone interview. I wasn't prepared enough, could not solve the second problem and that was it.

The interviewer was largely disorganized and last-minute rescheduled my phone screen multiple times without apology. Call was lackluster on my end. I did not proceed with the process after speaking with the representative.

One phone screen and one Skype interview. The whole process was very quick to set-up, and I received my offer just a couple of days after my last interview. This is the best interview experience that I've had with a company.

I have two phone coding interview over Skype. Than they invite me to offline interview: four interviews one after another in a single day. Questions was pretty hard to answer, because you should hold in your mind two major things: think very fast and to be very accurate in what you are writing in the code. That was hard for me, but I'm very happy to have such experience. Facebook…  was seemed to me like superior place in case if you want to spend you whole life to coding and if really like it.

1-2 Skype interviews and one on-site interview in Menlo Park, California.Skype interview (45 min total, interviewer was late => 30 minutes for coding).A Facebook manager asked usual behaviourial questions and then one coding task.

One online coding round, followed by two interviews. They asked basic questions, mostly from leetcode. The interviewers seemed interested and HR was responsive. I did all the questions, still did not receive an offer. No idea why. They do not give feedback.

I got referred by a friend. After a 1-2 weeks I was contacted by a recruiter.The first stage was composed of 2 phone interviews. This interviews are algorithm questions. The first one was about grouping anagrams the second one about range intersections.After I passed this interviews I was invited for a day of onsite interviews. There where 3 onsite interviews, one was non-technical (about my background) and the other 2…  technical (mostly algorithms and coding). Between the 2 technical interview I went for a coffee brake with an employee and I had the chance to ask him more questions about his work and about Facebook in general.

I went through the first two Skype interviews. In each interview I was asked to introduce myself, then the interviewer gave me two problems to solve. The first one was easy. The second one was a little bit harder. Each interview lasted around 50 minutes.

I got the interview by referral from a teacher who was in contact with the recruiter. The teacher gave my contact to the recruiter and a few days later I received an email to schedule the first skype interview. The question I mention was from this interview. I succeeded and got another skype interview, in which I failed. Pretty straightforward process, though.

HR approached me via email, asked to tell a little bit about my self, and what is my strongest programming language, sent me a mail with pointer where to learn from.An phone Interview was set up for 3 weeks later.it was on collabedit.com with skype. the interviewer was very nice, asked to talk a little bit about what I do.asked one question.if you need to implement bool Find(string str) which…  finds if a string exists in a dictionarydescribe the data structure you will use.a.write how one node of it will look like,b. implement the function and add support for "?" wildcard which can return more than once.

Made it part the first phone interview, rejected on the technical interview after not knowing the questions. Entire process took about 3-4 weeks, and ran very smoothly. Phone interview lasted 15 minute and the technical interview an hour.

I submitted my cv on career fair and get the campus interview. Before the campus view, they hold a meeting at a cafe to let us meet with the interviewers.

It was scheduled interview after few days after I applied online. Not all of the online technical test questions were solved by me, but interview was scheduled anyway, which is good.

Online Application, submitted the resume only. Contacted next day for a phone interview.After the first interview was schedule for a second phone interview. Finally went for the onsite interview in Menlo Park where there was 3 interview in the same day.

I got the interviews by giving my resume to a recruiter at a tech talk, and then I had two technical interviews. The interviews were involving basic knowledge of graph theory and some more than basic knowledge of data structures. Overall the interview experience was pretty good and I got feedback in a decent amount of time.

Facebook employee referred me : 1 telephonic round + 4 onsite (1 Cultural fit + 1 Design + 2 Coding). The interview process was very smooth and all the interviewers were very friendly. Most of the questions in the coding round were on algorithm fundamentals. Also they expect clean coding with proper testing. The design round is more like the discussion you would have with your teammate suggesting pros and…  cons of each method.

I apply on Software engineering position. HR contacted me, and told that he thinks I'm not good for this position. I received email with some questions about my experience and what I want to do in Facebook.

I applied online and was invited to the phone interview. After one phone interview I was invited to the onside interview in London. Visa process took near 1+ month. All trip was prepaid by company.There was 4 interview and dinner: 1 background check, 2 about algo, and 1 for desing.After interview my recruted share with me reviews. This is the first company that share review with me after interview and…  this is really nice.

Very nice phone interview. The interviewer was very calm and kept a relaxed atmosphere (no pressure to finish faster and no negative reactions when you get a question wrong).Questions were not very difficult: find all possible permutations for a string and finding an element's position in a slightly sorted array in the most efficient way (you have something like [5,6,7,1,2,3] and you want the position for "2" -> you use…  binary search algorithm)

I was referred by an existing employee. After an initial email by a recruiter, I didn't hear back for two weeks. I dropped a chaser and the managed to get the interview process started. I did a total of two phone screens with them. The first one went quite well and I heard back from the recruiter within a day. However I didn't manage to get past the second phone…  screen.Each phone screen is pretty much standard, the interviewer calls you on your mobile or Skype, and provide you with a collabedit or codeshare page to type out code in real-time.The recruitment process is slick and systematic generally.

I was referred by a friend and after some back-and-forth they set up a phone screen via Skype and collabedit.com. The feedback was very quick after the initial phone screening.

The process went very smoothly. The experience with the recruiter was fantastic and the recruiter was always excited to talk about the company and kept me informed of what was happening throughout the entire process.I did an initial screening interview and then a full day of on-site interviews. The on-site interviews consisted of two coding exercises (one on a whiteboard and one on a laptop), one on architecture, and one…  more that I don't remember.

The interview process for the internship position consisted of two phone interviews. The first interview was more about my past experience and had a single programming question. During the interview you're supposed to code the solution in a language of your choice. The interviewer will see what you're coding as you type and make mistakes. By doing so they have insights on how you approach programming problems.The second interview had…  two programming questions with similar degree of difficulty.

I was initially contacted by a recruiter, and was then interviewed via Skype. The interviewer had a pretty strong accent so it was hard to follow him at some points of the interview. He didn't spend time asking me about my background, but he was kind to respond questions in the end.

Started with a quick phone call from a recruiter at facebook. He was very nice and polite but not technical. Questions were related to past experience but I felt as though it was more just a quick fit check before moving to a more technical interview.Next step was a call with a Senior Engineer. The phone call was about one hour in which the you will be quized about elementary…  data structures and algs.

I applied through website took 2+ months. FB is very efficient in hiring. The HR first sent some regular questions for me to answer, including the time to start working and so on, and then arranged the phone interview directly. On the same day of my phone interview, she arranged for onsite interviews. I was impressed with how efficient they are.

I was contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn. After a general chat with recruiter (current role, relocation, tech skills) we went ahead with the phone screen.I was asked 2 coding questions, which I coded, but I needed some hints in the second one.A few days later I got the email that the team would not like to move forward. And I can setup a call for review the feedback, which…  I didn't. I knew I wasn't super fast on coding, and problem solving.

Phone call interview with engineer. Interviewer was very nice, talked about my previous work and his previous work. Then got into coding questions.

I had one phone interview, then fly to Hong Kong for the onsite interviews. There are four interviews, two for the coding, one for the design and one for both coding and behaviour question.

It's a long process but it is very clear. Starts with one skype interview about general things, a second skype interview about coding. Then if everything goes well an on-site set of interviews (4 in total) about different aspect (cultural, coding, design).The last set is kind of extenuating, in all exercises there is always something more to add to the solution.I finally didn't get the job because of the result…  of one of these interviews

The recruiter contacted me by LinkedIn and schedule a phone interview 10 days later.It was a high level talk about my background and my interest in Facebook.2 weeks laters I had a technical Skype interview with online coding.The day after, the recruiter sent me an email saying I did well and would be scheduling a onsite interview at their office in Sao Paulo.The interview took place in February, almost 2…  months later.

I take the China Batch Day from Oct. 2013, and finishes the event Feb. 20 in HongKong.

Contacted by recruiter in LinkedIn.Phone interview with recruiter, code interview in skype, presence interviews in Sao Paulo office (4 interviews in a role with a quick snack break). Some of the interviewers didnt seem much engaged in the interview.The company paid for all the costs with transportation and accomodation.

Phone screen

I competed in a Kaggle competition conducted by Facebook.A few weeks after the competition ended I was contacted by a recruiter and asked a few basic questions via email. About a week after that the recruiter told me I was going to be interviewed. He also included a bunch of URLs to read so I would be familiar with the Facebook interview style.The interview was setup by a coordinator. Two…  days later the interview took place over the phone.The interviewer introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself by discussing my favorite project. He said my resume was too extensive to discuss. I worked in Silicon Valley for 5 years and have a significant background in software engineering. There was no discussion of the Kaggle competition.He then presented a puzzle. It involved a grid with the letters X, O, and G. X were walls, O were rooms, and G were guards. I had to create an algorithm that computed the the shortest path to each room from a guard. So if it took a guard 3 steps to reach a room, and another guard 2 steps, then you would only keep the 2. The grid was variable size (N x N).The task was to design the algorithm and then code it up in a shared web page. I had about 35 minutes to complete the puzzle.I wasn't able to get it completed. The next day I thought about it while eating lunch and the best way to solve it became clear. I was definitely on the right track during the interview, but it was simply incomplete.The puzzle itself wasn't amazingly hard. It's just the time constraints. I needed another 20 minutes or so to get it done right.A few days later I was told my background was not what they were looking for. This was a really strange thing to say because my background was never discussed. There is no doubt in my mind that my background is strong enough to work at facebook. As a matter of fact, after seeing the skills of the interviewing engineer (I looked him up on LinkedIn), I feel I'm over qualified.A few observations...This was the first time I've been interviewed by someone with significantly less experience than myself.Your past experience is irrelevant. I could have helped Steve Jobs invent the iphone but if you can't solve the puzzle then you'll be passed over.While I was working on the puzzle the interviewer gave me a "tip". It turns out that the tip was incorrect. I'm 100% positive that using an efficient solution is completely incompatible with the tip he gave me. Maybe it was part of the test.If you're good at puzzles and have a solid understand of software development, but not a lot of experience, then you should go apply.My personal impression is that they're looking for younger less experienced people. My interviewer started out as an intern so that seems to be a good alternative if you're still in college.

It was a phone screening. Everything was fine.

The recruiter started the contact, we schedule an interview. In general in this first one I was asked about my experience, what I've worked with, the recruiter presented FB and all the cool stuff that we are used to hear about it. The she asked 2 easy techinical:1 - What's a linked list, how it looks like, how do you implement it, in what it differs from an array and…  to explicity a use case that I would pick a list instead of an array.2 - She picks a number between 0-1000 and wants to know what would I do to guess it (binary search).In the techinical interview I was asked to develop, in 45 minutes, an algorithm able to print a tree level by level, each level in one line. I did it successfully. The only problem is that when I was about to test it, the interviewer just interrupted and said that something was wrong instead of just let me do it, I fix it, then it happened again.After finish the algorithm he asked me about time and memory consumption of the algorithm which I also calculated correclty.After the test he opened to questions, so he shared a lot about fb's culture, projects, carreer, etc.

I'm outside US, so I had 2 interviews by now, all remote throw Skype.

I got a chance of phone interview with Facebook through Interviewstreet about a year and a half ago and failed quickly, mostly because I'm not a native English speaker and I am really bad at speaking English. I keep practicing English after that, then I got another chance 2 months ago, recommended by a friend interning at Facebook.The recruiter return to me very quickly, in less than a week, but…  I'm very busy and not well prepared at that time, so I did the phone interview a month later. I was asked to solve an easy coding problem, I finished it very quickly but made a small mistake in analyzing the complexity. I only found that mistake after the interview. The interviewer is very experienced, I have a great time talking to him after the coding phrase.Then I got a chance to onsite. I had 3 interviews. 2 interviewers asked coding problems and 1 asked coding problems and also talked about my projects in resume. The problems are harder than the problem in phone interview. I really struggled at 1 of them. But I think I did a good job at another ones. The interviewer who talking with me about my projects is from a strong background and seems a little tough, I must say I was very nervous when talking to him, but luckily it turned out well.In overall, the recruiters and the interviewers are all very nice. I am not familiar with the process of interviewing with companies in U.S and asked so many questions, the recruiters replied very quickly.

The whole interview took a long time, but the final result was positive.

Initial phone conversation with facebook recruiter of about 20 mins, going over my background and experience as well as what I was looking for.Set up a phone interview with a shared screen coding question, was suggested 2 weeks to prepare.Had I passed this stage, would go into London for an all day interview.

The process consisted of an onsite interview in Buenos Aires. It was a 30 minutes interview in which I had to answer 2 different problemas. After that they invited me to interview again in Menlo Park.

The process starts with me sending an resume to them. Someone send me an e-mail inviting me to an interview over internet, we met and was just about my past, and check what I wrote at my resume. After this I had the second one, whit another person, the main was to fill me up about what were my possibilities and possible work places. After I had the technical one,…  they really say that you must be prepared. I did not believe that it was difficult, actually I did answer it correctly, I believe that what is trick it`s the way that you answer or how fast your get it how god it`s your code, answering it correct it`s not enough. After this I waited for a week for the answer, unfortunately I did not receive a job offer or my process continue.

They were as friendly as you can imagine and gave me a T-Shirt. I met a kind of famous security guru.

Submitted my resume online, and got an email about two weeks later setting up an Online Coding Interview with engineer using Skype and collabedit.com. And just some normal coding problem, cost about half or one hour. Write a function to process regular expression with letter, ".", "*".

screening interview: project talking + 2 coding problems + motivation talking1. search *query* in *document*2. search a word in a character matrix

The interview started directly with 2 coding problems for 45 minutesThe two problems were not hard at all didnt ask me HR questions although he asked one of my friend why do you want to have internship at facebook and what changes do you recommend to facebook

1st round was the apti round it was the part of facebook campus drive to our campus . I was shorlisted for interview. Then I went to hyderabad for interview and interviewer asked me two coding questions and that's it.

good people. Know their stuff. You need to read the job description really well and be sure that you speak to the requirements because *they* may not ask for them precisely in the interview: none the less are expecting you to cover these. They are perhaps more concerned with standard methods than they initially project. Carefree attitude in some employees in interview process, others are VERY interested to hear about…  process.

It was my first interview at Facebook. I was very nervous. The interviewer asked me two coding tasks. I was not able to solve the first one although it was very easy. It took more than 75% of the interview coding and debugging it. The second task was easy also and I solved it within few minutes.

2 Phone interviews + 3 Onsite interviewsPhone interview questions: Sort a array containing values 0,1 or 2Find 3 values from an array whose sum is 0.

Hiring process is fast.All interviewers were very nice.

Had a phone interview which consisted of very basic programming questions. The interviewer was very nice, but wasn't sharing an information on why I didn't pass the interview. I think that the interview looks for attention to details rather than creativity or "smartness".

I faced three 1 on 1 interview rounds, each with one coding question.Round 1: Given an undirected graph and a node, modify the graph into a directed graph such that, any path leads to one particular node.Round 2: Given a matrix of size mXn, and a list of cells, find the number of paths from the top left cell to the bottom right cell.Round 3: Solve a linear equation in…  one variable, where the possible operands are +,- and * along with brackets. For eg. (2x + 5 - (3x-2)=x + 5)The interviewers themselves were very helpful, prodding me towards the right answer, and it was a good experience overall

Phone interview - coding questions on "whiteboard" (online editor)

The first interview was quite simple. I had to do some coding over the phone using a web notepad app while the interviewer watched. The first was a simple programming question to write a method. The second was a slightly harder, problem solving question. It was to write a method which involved comparing two strings and counting how many letters from one string fits into another.

Was contacted via LinkedIn / StackOverflow Careers, sent in CV, got a call from a person to discuss a few points on my CV. Was scheduled for technical interview via skype. Was quite nervous and screwed easy questions around which data structure to use for the posed problem of finding all connected components in a bitmap (0/1) picture.The interviewer was quite nice and forth coming but I wouldn't have given…  a further call to myself and that's what he recommended.

I was referred to by a friend of mine interning at Facebook. A recruiter then set up me two phone interviews, each lasting about 45 minutes. The interviewers were very friendly but I was too nervous because it was my first time to interview, so I performed bad at both interviews. After that I got an email that I was not a good fit for the position.

Am from China. Got the recruiting information from my university forum.After submitting my resume, first is a online programing puzzle. It's 90 min long. Not very hard.After the puzzle, I got 2 rounds of phone screens. Each lasts 45min, interviewer will keep asking questions until time up.Then they flew me to HK for the final-round interviews. Too bad, got eliminated in the last round.

First interview: 20 minute phone conversation about past experience with a technical recruiter that works for them.Second interview: 45 minute phone interview, with a PC in front. He gave me some details about the company and gave me one coding challenge.

Initial Communication -Email from recruiter asking to solve a problem on Interviewstreet. Simple enough. Led to phone interview with a Facebook engineer.Phone interview questions -Check if given string is a palindromeFibonacci series generator

Phone interview at first, then a coding exercise. If you are chosen after the coding exercise, you will have a chance to attend the bootcamp in Facebook headquarter in Palo Alto.

on campus, phone interview, on site, and followed by 4 interview, and a test

Submitted my resume online, and got an email about two weeks later setting up a technical phone screen. It consisted of typical coding questions that you'll find in any book. The first round is pretty simple and they're just looking for basic coding skills. My advice is to be sure you have practiced with a compiler.

one technical interview on the phone

I was invited for an on-campus college interview. There was 5 minutes in the beginning talking about previous experience. Then a coding part; I think they had three questions prepared, but they could get the same sense of your skills whether you only answered one or all three. It's Facebook -they know what they want and there's no frills to the interview.

Had a typical phone screen. The phone screen questions were in-line with the phone screen questions outlined on the site. Was brought on-site for an in person interview. The on-site interview questions were again coding questions. I don't think they were too difficult. I didn't get an offer. I believe I did not solve the coding problems quickly enough.

Interview for a summer internshipThe process is really fast - it takes two consecutive days to take the interviews and you get the result within twenty four hoursInterviewers are friendly and try to relax the candidateUsually there are no knowledge-based questions, and you can choose your preferred language

Smooth, good follow up.

I had a single phone interview and the interviewer was almost an hour late. He mentioned that he forgot about the interview.

Submitted resume online. I think it said there were so many people who apply that I could a multi-hour programming challenge online and if it was successful I'd get a phone screen call. Reviewing the sample problem, it might have been an NP-Hard problem or at least one that would require several hundred lines of mind-breaking code. I program all day for a living and even off hours for other…  projects. Resumes should qualify one for a phone screen. I submitted just that and got a canned rejection email a couple days later, presumably for not doing the quiz.

- Applied at their official career page.- Got contacted by recruiter from Dublin office, scheduled another interview with a recruiter from HQ- General question from the HQ recruiter, scheduled a phone coding interview- Code interview was 45 min, 2 questionAll the interviewers were nice and patience.

one skype interview after on-site.

I submitted just that and got a canned rejection email a couple days later, presumably for not doing the quiz.A couple weeks later I was contacted by a FB recruiter. We spoke approximate 30 minutes and emphasis was placed on how fun a place it is to work. They do a single 45-minute in person technical interview, and if that goes well they do 4, 45-min technical interviews in a single visit.The single 45-min session started with about 3 minutes of initial talk about my resume and what I work on now. I don't get the sense they cared at all about experience or what I was or have worked on. After that charade was done, we jumped right to the whiteboard.Two programming questions were asked. The first was an array reordering one that was almost trivially easy but I worked through it cleanly. He seemed quite happy with that. The second was significantly harder than the first, a complex array algorithm. I worked my way through it on the board but my solution was non-ideal in time complexity after analysis. He suggested we rework it. While I was able to and understood the logic, I relied on his feedback a bit much to come to the final solution in the last minutes.Got rejection email the next morning from recruiter. Apparently others in their interview pool for the position had got a more optimal answer faster.

I submitted my resume online and a recruiter got back to me about 6 months later. We set up a phone interview and the guy who interviewed me seemed like he wasn't very interested and certainly wasn't very engaging. He asked me to print all the subsets of a set, but I did it in a way that he didn't think was very good or optimized, so I didn't get…  past that interview.

Facebook hires software engineers from all around the world. One can apply in their website . Sometimes they invite people for interview too. First phase is the phone interview phase. Normally 2-3 phone interviews take place, where the interviewee is asked to code in a shared document. Some other questions are also asked. If pleased from the performance, facebook will call the applicant for an onsite interview.

Recruiter outreach for interview. Online interview via collabedit for coding. Normally they ask 3 questions, but I couldn't get past the first one.My suggestion: gather all the questions here on glassdoor and just practice the questions. Interviwer was friendly. They didn't ask any questions about datastructures or anything, but maybe that's because I didn't get past the first question.

Was contacted by recruiter through linkedin profile. Had a initial phone interview with collabedit. Was not offered an onsite interview.Was asked to write a program that would take a filename and a search pattern as arguments and return if the pattern matches the filename. Wildcards * and ? can be used in the pattern.eg:1. filename: file.txt pattern: f*txt result pattern matches2. filename:file.txt pattern:f?le* result: pattern matchesAnswer:bool matchFilename(const string& flname, const…  string& patter){    for (int i=0,j=0;i<flname.length(),j<patter.length();i++,j++)    {            if (patter.at(j)=='*')            {                if (j+1<patter.length())                {                    i = flname.find(patter.at(j+1),i+1);                    i--;                }            }            else if (patter.at(j)=='?')            {/*do nothing*/}            else            {                if (flname.at(i)!=patter.at(j))                return false;            }     }     return true; }

I first had a coding contest organized in the school, which was on the interviewstreet platform. After that, I had an on-site interview at Facebook, Hyderabad office. Interviewers were flown from the HQ for the process. There were a total of 1/2/3 interview rounds depending on the performance on previous interviews. I had a very positive experience overall. The recruiter and other staff were very pleasant.

Got contacted through college. 2 technical phone rounds..both coding. questions were moderate to tough then onsite

I was contacted by a recruiting agency for software engineering position at Facebook, and after I told them I was willing to apply, my resume was forwarded to Facebook's recruiter. Next day, I got an email from the FB recruiter with a link to an online coding test on interviewstreet. This test was for one hour duration, designed to test coding skills of the interviewer. It was a string parsing…  problem and code could be written in any language and we'd just need to submit the output on a given input set. I got an email later from the Facebook people that I passed that test and would need to do a phone interview. My phone interview was scheduled in a week.              An engineer called me up for the phone interview and asked about my work projects. I explained to him briefly and also got to know a little about his work at Facebook. He then followed onto the technical interviewing part and posed a problem for me. We were working on a shared document for this part. This was a problem about the classic binary search tree data structure, like an RB Tree. I coded a simple solution and I was asked to analyse its runtime complexity. I analysed the complexity and was able to put it in Big O notation. He was satisfied with that solution and then moved onto talking about his work, what Facebook is expecting from the candidates and such. The conversation quickly ended after that . A couple weeks later, their recruiter informed me that I passed the phone interview and would be scheduled personal interviews.            About a month after my phone interview, it was the day for the personal interviews and I was flown into their interviewing location. I had two technical interviews that day and another general, informal get-to-know-you-and-your-work type of interview. For technical interviews, code was to be written on a whiteboard. In one of the technical interviews, I was told to come up with an algorithm for a variation of the classic knapsack problem. This could be solved with a dynamic programming and I coded the same on the whiteboard. It's important to explain how the solution was arrived at. After coding it up, I was asked to analyse its complexity. I'd written a recursive solution and I could only write a recurrence relation for the complexity function, not a closed form. I also told him that an interative solution is also possible and wrote it out too. Being an iterative code, with a simple nested loop, it was also easy to analyse its complexity. The interviewer was actually ok with the recurrence relation for the complexity and didn't bug me on an exact form. He seemed satisfied with my solution and then we moved onto general topics. Interview was quickly over after that.            For the second technical interview, I was asked a problem on balanced binary search trees. I'd previously implemented an RB Tree and that experience helped me very much for this interview. Without this experience, I couldn't have solved that problem and would've been rejected. I was asked the classic interview problem on sorted-but-rotated array. I knew the solution for this one and it involved binary search. I wrote the solution for this one and the interview was quickly over after that.            I was told to provide 3 personal references on that day and left for home. About 2 weeks later, I was informed that there would be another technical interview. In this interview, I was asked to implement a simple regex parser. Conceptually, some what simpler than the other interviews, but getting the implementation correct was tricky for this one. I got it right and he was satisfied with the code. I was also then asked about the runtime complexity for the solution. I left the interview confidently.            A week later, I was offered the job. Generally speaking, good programming skills help a lot in getting this job. On top of that, I'd suggest reading the CS algorithms textbook by Cormen. Writing good code, with a clear understanding of its complexity is a must.

Skills test (complete a puzzle), phone interview (very friendly) - basic questions about BSTs, followed by on site interview (4 interviews in a day); various questions; algorithms, data structures, approaches to problem solving etc. Very quick to respond, the result (negative) was in about four days.

I got contacted by an HR. After some email traffic, I got a skype call with HR to discuss the interview process.I solved a puzzle at interviewstreet and they set up an appointment with the engineer at California.Technical Phone interview lasted 30 mins. Interviewer was friendly but he immediately asked for live coding (in 6-7 mins). And because of he is Indian, it was very difficult to understand him as…  a not native English speaker.He asked for a technical question, wanted to optimize code, and then told me the interview is over.

HeyI got contact with a recruiter, then we talked about 30 minutes. One week after I had one phone interview. He asked me two coding questions and he also wanted me to prove mathematically why my solution is right. I did the coding problems and I prove what he wanted.After a week, they invite me for onsite interview. There were 4 interview. The first was more about my research and…  only one coding question. The last one was high level design question and the other two were just coding.I did pretty good, and I just made one silly mistake for implementing one problem. I figured it out after 10 min, but I had the feeling that the interviewer does not like it. That was the coding question at the end of the first interview. I think that killed me and I didn't get any offer.

A recruiter contacted me telling that he got my contacts from a list of an online programming competitions website. Then, he scheduled a first screening interview that consisted of basic questions like "why facebook". Then, they scheduled technical phone interview. I passed it and waiting for the onsite interview. The onsite interview consisting of 4 phases, 1 cultural behavior, 2 coding and 1 design performance interview.

1) Recruiter contacted me over Linkedin2) I answered some questions using email.3) Short non-technical interview with the recruiter focusing on experience, education, projects etc.4) Phone interview with coding over the internet.5) 4 On-site interviews one after another. They were actually conducted over Skype Video calls to save time before h1b visa allotment runs out. Out of these four interviews 2 were coding interviews, 1 - design/performance/scale and 1 - cultural.I'm…  especially happy with the way recruiter handled everything and the speed of the process.

The phone interview worked very well. The interviewer asked some experience questions and went into the coding. It was not too difficult and I did it very well. Then after ten days, I was invited to the on-site. There were four engineers. One asked design questions and the others asked coding questions. I was nervous and didn't sleep well at all the night before, so I was in bad shape.…  It's a pity that I lost this chance.

The talking was accompanied with noise. I was asked a simple string question.Because before the interview, the website recommend to give a solution which can be explainedeasily. I chose the simplest way to do so. And from the interview, I found facebook only want to get some programmer, but not researcher. Several days later, I got rejected. I think sometimes if you have time,you can choose some complicated algorithm, even…  you can not make sure to explain very well.

1 phone screen + 4 interviews on-site

Find all sub sets of size k from given set

Took 2 weeks to schedule phone interview. Interviewer was nice..gave hints and examples on the way. and then after 1 week I heard that they will not be proceeding

Passed an online puzzle(simple one) then get a phone interview(easy one too). Two days after the phone interview I get an onsite interview(six days later from now).

A friend of mine working there referred me to the recruiter. The recruiter promptly contacted me to set up a phone interview and asked me what I want from my career and if I like fast paced working environment. Everything was very smooth and professional.The phone interview lasted about an hour and I was asked to write codes on some collaboration editing web site like google doc.The problem to solve…  and a couple of function headings were already given in the web page.The question was about the binary tree. I was supposed to write a function to return the next node in inorder traversal sequence. In itself, it looks complicated but, there was a funciton heading called, init(), that you can use to preprocess and add any data structure you need.I somehow missed this initially and found this too late :(

The recruiter first emailed me to confirm a time for a telephone call. The call from recruiter was not for interview, she just told me their hiring and interview process, gave some basic suggestions for interview and finally confirmed a time for the first phone interview. After the first phone interview I got the second phone interview in one week and stopped here.

One phone interview with recuireter, one phone interview with an engineer.Questions are simple, but you have to come up with a fast and simple answer.

The interview was arranged by a recruiter who had contacted a Professor from the University I was studying.The interviewer was an impatient person who had flaky way of talking. Overall, the interview was very unpleasant.

Get contacted by HR after drop resume in a campus event.Attended the on campus interview.The process is very fast paced. And the interviewer is very friendly.He provided hints and gave follow-up discussion about your solution.

ask about genearal question of Binary search tree.

Failed after three phone coding interviews

I attended the on-campus interview. The interview process were two 1 hour sessions in the consecutive days, primarily focusing on the paper coding. The interviewers are friendly and willing to help. After you finished a questions, the interviewer would post another one until they run out of the question. Then you can leave early and it didn't seem to affect the evaluation.

They contacted me by email and asked me to perform a test at interviewstreet.com website. The test has a timer and should be solved in at most 1 hour. You should write the code, and make sure that all test cases are passing. That means that you have to write the output in the exactly way they are expecting. I finished the test in 55 min. After that they contacted…  by email again to schedule a phone interview.

Do an programming puzzle in interviewstreet website.The puzzle is about Balances with limited time in one and half hour.I have done it in time and a month later one of Facebook connect me that Ihave passed the programming puzzle and will give me an online phone interviewlater. I am waiting for that.

applied online as a software engineer. got an email from a recruiter after a couple of weeks. got explanation about the process. (2 phone interviews + 4 interviews (on-site))heard the interviews would be mostly about programming. during the interview, got asked to program some typical programming questions. even though the questions were not that hard, failed to write the code cleanly/quickly enough. got rejected just a couple of hours later.

Because of my good rank in code sprint 2, a Facebook recruiter contacted me and arranged a phone interview. After a week, I got a technical interview with a Facebook engineer.The problems include:1. Design a new feature for Facebook2. C++ knowledge questions about static and virtual function3. Implement a function to compute cubic rootToo bad that I didn't notice that the cubic root can be larger than the original number.…  I got rejection after 2 days.

They contacted me by email and asked me to perform a test at interviewstreet.com website. The test has a timer and should be solved in at most 1 hour. You should write the code, and make sure that all test cases are passing. That means that you have to write the output in the exactly way they are expecting. I finished the test in 45 min. After that they contacted…  by email again to schedule a phone interview.

It was 2 days interview with 2 tech questions per day. After each interview friendly chat about what Im interested in, no pressure. Interviewers were friendly, gave hints along while solving the problems. It was like "first action, then talk" style interview.

I was asked to implement a few algorithm based questions on an online whiteboard. They are looking for people who come up with the fastest algorithm with no backtracking at all. For one of their questions, initially I implemented an O(n log n) solution and then realized a linear solution was possible but it was too late. I was informed the interview was over.

I had one phone interview with HR-person and one interview with technical guy.Interview with HR consisted of checking my personal details and what I want to do on FB (backend or frontend).After one week I had technical interview with 2 problems. It was my first phone interview. I failed to complete tasks.First problem:- Given array find 3 elements in array that sum up to 0Second:- You have array of elements…  of 3 types. How would you sort them?

Got an email from Facebook that it sees my resume and wants to give me an interview.But first get a call from the recruiter to discuss about my intention.The phone lasted like 10~15 mins, just asking about my previous experience, graduation date, and my team choice.Then the 1st phone interview was scheduled. It is probably one of the hardest, thinking that they want to cut down as many people as…  possible.After that was the 2nd, then on-site.On-site, I met like 6 others Google Interns, and then we had a tour of the office, lunch, then 3 consecutive interviews.Then I got the offer like 3 days later (cuz I told them I had other deadlines, so they made it fast).They had a talk with one of my professor, who I wrote as the reference.

Contacted by a recruiter who asked about programming experience and why I want to work for Facebook. Then two separate technical phone interviews with software engineers followed. They introduced what they are working on in detail. They asked one or two typical coding questions, sharing them on the Collabedit.

First, a group of Facebook employees came to my campus to conduct on campus interview. There were 2 rounds of on campus interview - you had to pass the first round in order to get to the second. After the 2 rounds, you should be notified whether or not you receive the job. However, they asked me to complete a third and final phone interview. It took several weeks to…  schedule, but finally I had the phone interview.In the first interviews, I was only asked coding questions. The third was more behavioral, but we ended with a coding question.

I entered 3 phone interview , each takes about 45 minutes . Each time some engineer who works at facebook calls you via skype and wants you to open doc file , and first he starts talking about you, wants you to give information about your projects. After that he starts asking algorithm questions.

The recruiter asked me if I would like to do a phone screen or go to the Facebook office and have a face to face interview. I chose the latter. I went there on time. They had asked me to bring the signed copy of the NDA which I did. I spoke to the recruiting coordinator and the interview with the engineer lasted about 45 minutes. The interviewer had another…  interviewer shadow him but only the main interviewer interacted with me.

Every single interview was exactly the same format: the interviewer gives me two or three programming problems and asked me to solve them in my language of choice in front of him on a whiteboard (or virtual whiteboard

Hr contacted me and gave a timed skill test, through interviewstreet. I didn't like to code in that website nor coding a timed test. basically they don't know how long its going to take and they give very less time.They don't tell that u can pause or come again etc.. in my opinion FB is over hyped good place to work move on to other good companies ;)

It consisted of 1 telephonic interview and four 1-1 interviews.

Asked to code in phone screen. Given two sorted arrays, do intersection or arrays in most efficient manner. I implemented it in using just one while loop, but missed to check NULL condition on the second array and got rejected! :(

I had to clear a online coding challenge. After that I had 4 rounds of this interview, one after the another on the same day. Most of the questions were technical in nature focusing on algorithms and problem solving. Other questions were based on my project and internships

Recruiter was helpful and accommodative to timing requests. Gave good overall description and expectations about interview process. Interview questions were not that difficult as imagined; however they apparently look for people who can code the most efficient solution at first go; which sometimes a game of luck. Interviewer was smart and polite; asking "logical" questions rather than trying to show off or stump the candidate sort of questions.

Recruiter contacted me, reasonably quickly [within a week] after applying online and was generally very helpful.But the first interviewer started phone interview around 10 minutes late [in the end ending up kicked out of conf. room] and asked two very simple questions. One of the questions was given 2 arrays of size n and 2n containing n elements only, both sorted in ascending order, How will you merge, first array…  with second [which has size 2n] into second array in ascending order. I just used merge sort merge step and wrote java like psuedo code in collabedit.I tried out my code later and it worked fine with no changes [except that I used .length() instead of .length for array length]. But he didn't provide any feedback on what he was looking for. It was correct and complexity was the best possible. One thing I can think of later was I didn't add any method level comments [although I had comments in body] as it was pseudo code. Maybe he was looking for it [pure guess - as I don't know what he wanted]. I left with impression of having done the interview very well [I have worked in the best of companies and got interviewed and interview for those companies] and most of the time you know when you blew it.But I was surprised to get the rejection, 2 days later! Particularly given that question was too easy! Now I am left pondering over what was it? I consider interviews where the perception of interviewer and interviewee differs wildly in terms of performance as bad interviews with negative experience associated with it, as the interviewer didn't communicate his intention with the interviewee properly. If he was not looking for correctness and perf. [objectively defined as mentioned above], What was it?

I was hired through Campus interview at IIT

I got my resume submitted through an existing employer at Facebook. Was first contacted by a recruiter who called me up and had a half hour talk with me discussing why I wanted to join Facebook, and surprisingly also started asking me data structures and C++ basics like friend functions, complexity of searching and sorting etc (though she assured me that this was not an interview and only an informal…  chat). I got all her questions correct, though I donot know if that made any difference. I followed up with her sending her an email regarding scheduling an interview and then she wrote back gconfirming a phone interview slot. It was a phone screen with a Software Engineer at Facebook, and I was asked to code in Collabedit, a web interface in which both I and he could write and see the code.

The interviewer was very friendly, and we chatted some after he introduced himself and his projects.He asked me to design and implement algorithms that correct typos, offering guidance, encouragement, and confirmation along the way. It felt really good to voice my thoughts along the way, and it helped him to know what I'm thinking.He asked a few follow-up questions afterwords about my code (which I think he made up on…  the spot). I answered and we agreed on the answers.Next, he presented a scenario that we formed a web startup featuring that code at its core. So then we discussed how to use more memory and less CPU, and how to scale up the company.At the end I asked him his thought about fb and what he did before working there.The experience was very fun.

I was first called by a FB recruiter and we chatted about 15 min about my general background information.I then was followed up with a phone interview with a FB engineer. He seems to be an experienced engineer. He started with a common background question like challenge of current project. Then, he asked me to design the Facebook Credit system. I proceeded with talking about I would started with designing…  the backend of the system, for example a ER diagram that would outline the relationship between existing user information and the new information related to the FB Credit system. I was a little nervous at the beginning, but the interviewer jumped in and gave me some help. He then asked me how would the total credit points of a user be calculated based on my design. For that question, I answered how the data is delivered to user from end to end in a multi-tiered web application. Next is the programing question (write a function to convert an ASCII representation of a positive integer to it's numeric value). I had a subtle bug in my code, but in general I got it right. I coded in PHP, the interviewer is satisfied with it since FB uses lots of PHP. The last 5 min was for me to ask him some questions.The interviewer was very professional and helpful during the interview. He was able to follow my thoughts and provide hints.

I interviewed with them during the campus career fair. Initially had 2 rounds of interview on our campus, and then we were flown in for the onsite interview. The onsite interview took almost an entire day. We took a tour of facebook's office and then had around 3 1:1 interviews.

Won Facebook hackathon on campus and got invited for interview

I was contacted by the Facebook recruiter saying I need to solve one of the puzzle from the Facebook puzzles to start the interview process. I had solved one problem and then recruiter scheduled my phone interview.The interview was good. The guy at the other end was nice and smart. The interview last for around 1 hr. It start by asking me about myself. He asked me about my choice…  between three platforms (linux kernel, MySql, JAVA script). I had chosen Mysql and he asked me why did I choose MySql. Other questions are described below.I got response from the recruiter that they would like to keep me on hold, as they are finding difficulty in judging with large number of candidates.I answered all questions correctly (I feel) except my written code (took around 10 to 15 mins) for the problem had one bug which he had noticed correctly and told me to resolve it. After resolving it he gave me the green signal.One of the big problem (I guess one of the main factor in the interview) I faced that as I am OK with English, I was finding difficulty in understanding his accent. So many times the interviewer had to repeat his questions.Lastly he asked me if I have any questions for them. I asked one question.This is how end my phone interview with Facebook.

An HR contacted me and said I should complete one of their three hardest puzzles. The puzzle was interesting, but the fact that I spent 2.5 days to do that (1 day was spent on submitting it in a correct way so that the puzzle robot accepts it), and it won't help when interviewing anywhere else, annoyed me.I then had a phone interview.The guy was very clever, which was nice.The…  questions were: what is the most exciting project you had, andwhite a function to multiply two arbitrarily large integers.I spent quite a while writing a recursive solution for the problem, made some mistakes during that, but fixed those purely by myself. The interviewer did not provide any feedback during the process when I described my "way of thinking" and the programming, so I even had to ask whether he was on the line. With phone interview, not feedback is a bit too harsh, imho.Then I was asked to write an iterative solution, and I completed it as well. I did not write the solutions easily, and my way of explaining was not perfectly clear and great, but I solved what I was asked.Then the HR contacted me saying they won't consider me anymore this year. I politely asked for feedback, but got the answer that there is nothing to share. Quite surprising for a social-oriented company.

The interviewer was very nice and friendly. After initial introductions about work experience, I was asked to solve a coding problem. Problem was for middle level of complexity.At the end, the interviewer asked me whether I have any questions. I asked question about their project, which was answered to reasonable detail.

Lots of phone interviews with algorithmic problems. Didn't get any cultural fit questions.. They're all done by engineers with minimal interview training, so be prepared to get an extremely unprofessional interviewer (which happened to me once out of 4 interviews).

The recruiter found me on linkedin and hounded me for more info about myself. 6 months and several non-technical interviews later, all of which went fine, they set up a technical interview with some guy who had such a thick accent and poor phone reception that I couldn't understand his questions, so I failed that interview and they notified me of my failure 2 days later.

This was the first round phone interview. I was asked two questions:1. Please write a program to merge two sorted array.2. Each key on the telephone represents a list of characters. Given a telephone number, please list all the possible strings it represents.I was asked to write exact code on an online document.

The process had the recruiter calling me for an easy screening test - which consisted of questions like what is a binary tree, where is dynamic memory allocated etc. After passing this screening, I had a phone interview with an employee - where I had to write code on a shared document. The interview went well, and I have no idea why i was not selected

Recently, I got a message on Facebook told me about the opportunity of working at Facebook. After replied it, I got some background check from their employee. He asked about my research interest and my willings to attend Facebook job interview. He also introduced their company and welfares. After all, I think it is a very comfortable interview since I can feel his enthusiasm.

I applied on facebook/careers and was contact by their HR for a screening test which consists of some behavioral questions and a few simple questions about c/c++ & Algo, such as what's a virtual destructor. And then they scheduled me for a tech phone interview during which I was asked to do two programming questions on Collabedit.com.

Submitted my resume/cover letter to Facebook to apply for a software engineering internship. I heard back from a recruiter in a couple of weeks, asking about my availability to set up a phone interview. I responded with my available dates, and never heard from the recruiter again. I sent one or two more follow-up emails, and still never heard back from the recruiter after the first email. Very professional, Facebook.

The interview is composed of 1 coding questions. The question is like how you reverse a linked list. However, the recruiter may add some restrictions like no recursion, no hashtable, etc.

I was referred by an employee and was contacted by a hr recruiter, who scheduled a phone interview with me. From reading online I was expecting a basic screen with questions like why do I want to work at Facebook, and what I do currently. I wasn't expecting any technical questions at this stage but she did throw a basic search question, which flustered me a bit, and after a…  few minutes of me talking it out but not giving the exact right answer, she said she would get back to me with next steps which would either be to complete one of the puzzles on the website or to schedule phone interviews with an engineer. Promptly the next day she responded that I needed to do at least one of the puzzles and that there was no time limit, but the faster I completed it, the faster I could move on. I'm currently working on one of the puzzles.

A technical recruiter set up a call with me. She asked about my research projects which she can't care less about. Then she asked what programming languages I am most comfortable with and some specifics about the language. I was also asked about the runtime complexity of binary search and the average num of guesses it takes to find a number between 1 to 1000. Overall it's pretty simple since…  this is just the first screening. The next interview will involve writing code in real time to solve a question asked by an engineering on the phone.

I applied for this position on their website. A few weeks later, they contacted me for an introduction conversation. Usually, they will ask you to solve a puzzle before they can move forward. But if you are a CS student from a top tier university, they may relax this requirement. I didn't impress them during my phone interview.

Well, it's only the first round interview. And I'm preparing for the following interviews. The questions are really easy, just some behavior questions (eg: why you applied, what can u contribute), and some technical questions related to algorithms and programming languages.

I did two phone interviews and then was flew in for an onsite.

they asked a few questions straight from the textbooks and asked me to implement some algorithms intrees. Once you finished, they wanted to know if you can improve the implementation by optimizing the complexity and memory usage. It looks like the interviewer is fresh out of the school and does not have much industry experience.

A fairly young lady with limited skills asked basic questions about my background and what I hoped to gain from working for Facebook. She then asked what language I programmed best and resumed to ask about 10 trivial questions about the language. (ex. What is the difference between Java's Array and Vector classes). She seemed to have trouble even reading the questions so it was clearly someone who did not…  know the answers either. I was directed to attempt one of their online challenges and respond to her when completed.

Contacted by a recruiter.

**************************************Data Visualization Designer**************************************
I was approached by an engineer because i had a specific expertise. we talked on skype (i was living in a different continent then) Then he vouched for me as a applied to one job for which i interviewed a couple of times over skype. the outcome was that I was passed on to another recruiter and another department. that second leg of the process took months because while they…  liked my skillset there wasn't really a position that could match it. eventually while I was in California for another reason I visited them and we had proper interviews (6 back to back interviews for 5 hours) after which I got the job.Now that I am on the other side what I can attest is that once you enter the pipeline the recruiter is your friend, they are on your side and want you to succeed and they are happy to assist the applicant with anything.

**************************************Manager, Software Engineer**************************************
I was contacted via LinkedIn which lead to a phone call. One of the recruiters then arranged a video chat. We chatted for about an hour at which point the recruiter said he'd like to bring me to the office to have a conversation over dinner with some of the people I could potentially work with. This sounded great. Sadly, this was the last I heard and after 3 emails…  to Carl yielded no response I gave up on it as a time waster.

**************************************Software Engineer,/Co-op**************************************
I applied via the Facebook University site in mid-October. In mid-November, I received an email (which was automatically sent to my spam folder) that Facebook would like to move forward with an interview. I sent an updated resume, the responses to a short questionnaire, and had a first round interview scheduled for mid-December.The first round interview was straightforward. About two minutes past the designated time, I received a call from…  a Palo Alto phone number. I had a nice, easy to understand interviewer who asked me to write a function which, given a tree node, printed all routes to the leaves. I then was asked about space and algorithmic complexity. Since I finished this problem quickly, she gave a second: create a function which given a two dimensional array prints the diagonals. In other words, if given [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], the function would print 1 2 4 3 5 6.I then had a few minutes to ask questions about the company. I was told to expect to hear from my recruiter within five days.Fifty minutes later, I got an excited email from my recruiter telling me I had been selected for a second round interview. It was scheduled for the day after my last finals.Again, about two minutes after the agreed upon time, I received a call from another Palo Alto phone number. Another very kind, easy to understand lady. We talked about my resume for about ten minutes (note this was the first person to discuss my experience) and then jumped into the coding problem.About a week later, I got an email from my recruiter informing me that Facebook would no longer be considering me for an opportunity.

**************************************IT Business Analyst**************************************
Only one initial interview with recruiter who was professional, personable and very responsive in contacting and replying to me. Position was not the right fit but upon request, I was given the specific requirement gaps in what they were looking for. Very positive experience due to responsiveness and candid information.

**************************************Entry Level Software Engineer**************************************
Was recommended through internal system.They were very prompt about responding to this and flexible when I asked to move it earlier to accommodate another offer.Phone interview was poor. Interviewer clearly did not each to be there. They didn't bother to turn off notifications on computer, or even mute them. Email specifically stated coding questions would go through website x. Interviewer disagreed, they wanted to use website y. This would have…  been fine, but I spent half an hour familiarizing myself with x. Y was also clunky, and froze when they were copied my code. Interviewer asked me to start a session and supply her with url.I struggled with the question, and she made things worse. At the end, she said, time's up and hung up within thirty seconds.

**************************************Page Ops Assistant (SG)**************************************
Applied through the career pages and I got a response in <2 weeks. Recruiter from India contacted me for a info session. Interview was scheduled the following week at the HQ, which was a vidcon with a page ops leader and a local staff. The interview went smoothly but i lacked a critical requirement for the job

**************************************Quantitative Engineering**************************************
I applied through campus recruiter. The recruiter was very nice and arranged the phone interview very soon.The phone interview was 45 minutes. First, The interviewer very briefly asked my background (about 2 minutes?), then moved to the coding test. The coding question was not hard. I gave a simple solution first, but the interviewer asked if I can improve it. Then I gave a better solution. Sounds like the interviewer…  was satisfied with the second one. the last 5 minutes, the interviewer asked me if I have any questions. I said no.

**************************************Online Sales Manager**************************************
I applied in 2011 march and got a call from the HR, she discussed my profile and we had a good discussion and she told me she will get back how ever there was no response then I called to followup and finally she told me that the position is on hold

**************************************BI Engineer**************************************
The interview process was three steps.1) Screening call to ensure the candidate has the basic requirements to proceed (30 min)2) Two part webinar skills test with hands-on SQL testing and hands-on Tableau testing (45 min each)3) On campus interview, 3 hours. Four individual 45 minute sessions led by different Facebook interviewers testing ability to query databases, understand data warehouse structures, general Q&A, Tableau skills test. Interview was concluded by a…  tour of the Facebook campus

Impressed with hiring process, but disappointed at not getting selected:Got an email from recruiter. Once we connected, she went over the responsibilities of the role with me. Then we scheduled an hour long onsite interview with the hiring manager.The interview was good and was followed by an onsite round of 5 interviews + lunch. Since this was for a data/BI position, not many coding questions, but a lot on design…  and SQL etc.Best part was that the recruiter was working with me the whole time. Without giving any confidential information, she told me more about my interviewers, the previous feedback interviewees have had about them , what I should expect, so on and so forth. For example, one of the interviewers had a reputation of being silent and she asked me not to be scared.Facebook also has a great interview prep session by gayle laakmann mcdowell which helps you in interview prep.Interviews:5 of them2 design/dw2 SQL1 pure culture fit interview.I am not sure where I missed but did not get an offer :(

**************************************Technical Sourcer**************************************
First: Happy Hour/Networking event - meet several interal recruitersSecond: pre-screen with recruiter over the phone to discuss what team i would be fitThird: Onsite and in person interview - Meet with three people 45 min each. Focus on the following three aspects: Sourcing skills, candidate experience, and Facebook values

Went for face to face interview through agency. Four people interviewed which lasted about 2.5 hours. They all majorly focused on how I have been recruiting and processes. Overall the experience was wonderful and they treated well.

I applied online for the position, and received an email from the recruiter about a month later. I had an initial phone interview with the recruiter that I would be supporting, then an onsite interview with two other recruiters on the team and the recruiting manager. I got a good sense of what the role would entail and also got a tour of the campus, which is absolutely unbelievable. I…  left with a clear sense of what the next steps would be, and received an offer within several days, which I accepted.

Scored the interview through a contact on a LinkedIn Alumni Group. I first had a phone screening. I went through my contacts to connect me with someone that worked at Facebook to ask for questions they might ask. They told me to make sure to take about their metrics. The person that scored me the interview told me that it wasn't needed. However when I got to the actual interview…  it was asked. I was then called for an in-person interview. I met with three different people who were going to be instructors for the sourcing bootcamp. Two of them were very approachable and friendly. The third person was very intimidating and asked very hard questions. It is better to over prepare! They said that it would take a week to hear about but they didn't, so it took a long time to figure out that I did not get the offer.

Phone interview followed by full loop of 4 in person interviews. First screen talked about the role and your resume. Onsite interviews were different types focusing on different things. Ninja/Jedi/Pirate.

2 Phone screens - 1 with recruiter for recruiters and 1 with a recruiter on the recruiting team I was interviewing for; on-site interview with 2 additional team members and 1 engineer for the engineering team I would be sourcing for

The interviewers are all very genuine and friendly, which made the process enjoyable! I was first contacted by phone for an interview and then brought onsite to meet with a couple more people from the same recruiting team. Since I interviewed during the afternoon, I also got free lunch at one of the cafes. The food was delicious and kept my energy up.

One phone call and a 5 hour onsite

telephone interview4 onsite interviewsLots of funI met very relevant peopleHad plenty of chance to ask questions myselfvery positive experienceMoved very quicklyWriting searches on whiteboardThey asked about my previous experience, asked how i would handle certain situations, role playing and behavioral interviews

It was very well-oiled machine, with regular two way communication flow. 1 recruiter screen, straight to onsite within a week with 4 additional interviews and another follow-up phone screen. Everyone was professional but friendly, punctual and they asked relevant questions. They felt more like a conversation than an interview.

**************************************Android Engineer**************************************
Applied online! Got a call after 2 weeks from HR who introduced me to another recruiting HR. He setup a time for a brief discussion. Asked a few multiple choice questions.Your photo-sharing app displays a system notification when the user receives a photo. Your app should display the photo when the user taps the notification. Which of the following do you need to attach to the Notification object that you…  pass to NotificationManager?A. An Activity referenceB. A PendingIntentC. A BroadcastReceiverD. A Fragment transactionIf you nest a RelativeLayout inside a LinearLayout, what type of LayoutParams would that RelativeLayout accept?A. RelativeLayout.LayoutParamsB. ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParamsC. ViewGroup.LayoutParamsD. LinearLayout.LayoutParamsYou’re writing a monitoring app that periodically checks if a website is up. Of those listed below, what is the BEST way to schedule these periodic checks?A. Register a WakeLock with PowerManager.B. Call setInexactRepeating on AlarmManager.C. Post to a Handler with postDelayed.D. Call setPeriodicTimer on TimerService.After I cleared that round, he setup a technical interview on the phone, which started with 1 Java question, 1 Android question and 2 coding questions which were to be done on coderpad. He didn't do introductions or anything which is mentioned on their website. The recruiter provided a link to a class with CTCI writer Gayle and also some training material. All coding questions were from Leetcode.After 2 days, the recruiter gave me feedback and asked for another phone interview as there were some areas that the interviewer thought he didn't have a "signal".The second phone interview was also the same but this time they were hard questions and I completed them before time and we had a small discussion about life at Facebook. The recruiter then called me after 2 days and said I crushed the interview and was asked to come onsite to Menlo Park, CA.Everything is paid by the company and you don't need to worry about anything except the flights getting delayed. I was late reaching the previous night before the interview and woke up early for the onsite.The onsite recruiter came on time and took me for a walk and asked some general questions about my preparations. Then he escorted me to a conference room and the interviews started coming one by one.1. 2 people (one interviewer and one observer): Background and personality quiz. Coding question found on leetcode.2. Android Engineering Manager: Design question on Facebook functionality.3. Android Engineering Manager: Coding question (From Leetcode)Lunch with an Android Engineer (told me that he has to submit feedback but it's just common talk).4. Android Security Engineer: Coding question with time complexity (From Leetcode)5. Android Engineering Manager (2 people-> one interviewer and one observer): Design question on Facebook functionlityRecruiter escorted me out and told me he will call me early next week. I got a call next week saying that the team is not going to move forward.Overall I think I struggled a bit with the white board questions but I was able to come up with naive solutions for 2 and 1 proper solution for the remaining one. Even though I struggled, I reached the solution in the end. One of the interviewer was wearing a tshirt and shorts and didn't seem interested at all. He was actually hoping that I would have revised leetcode and just jotted down the correct answer. I would recommend that if you can revise and learn the top 20 questions from Leetcode, you will get through because it's the most important thing and even though you have patents or experience in multiple domains, it doesn't count.

A recruiter contacted me if I'm willing to apply at facebook London, we proceeded with an initial Skype conversation and then scheduled for a technical interview.In a technical interview, we started with some basic questions of performance in Android development.Then there were two coding exercises, I did well in the first exercise it was easy but my code was not fully optimized. In the second exercise, I missed some corner…  cases.

The interview was pretty easy.They ask for pretty simple problems.Sometimes some interviewers don't know what they want themselves, but generally everyone is polite.Phone screen - talkPhone screen - programmingOn-site interview - 5 interviews each with 1-2 problems and android questionsI solved all the problems, but didn't get

Found on Linked in they sent one email then a follow up as i didnt respond to the first one. Then they did a phone screen. I got though the phone screen and have had one skype interview with another to come. THe process is still ongoing

there was one screening followed by a technical round (in skype). Technical round had one algorithm question which has to be solved in 15 minutes and theoretical questions for 15 to 20 minutes. Overall it took an hour.

**************************************Finance Associate Manager, Global Sales & Marketing**************************************
Facebook gave me a verbal offer and then took it back.1. I was initially contacted by an FB recruiter to have a phone interview where we discussed typical experience questions.2. I was then brought in-house to interview with the GSM finance team (the hiring manager and direct reports). I enjoyed meeting the team as everyone was friendly and seemed like people I wanted to work with. The questions covered FP&A,…  experience, and situations.3. I then made it to the next and final round which was with two finance directors. The questions were mainly high level (e.g. where do you want to be in five years, what project are you most proud of, etc.).4. Several days later, the recruiter called me and told me I got the job! During the call she asked me if I would take the job as we had just gone through weeks of interviews and FB needed someone to take the job. Obviously, I said yes, basically committing myself to FB (I had told the recruiter I had interviews scheduled with other companies, but said I was going to cancel them because I wanted FB). She then proceeded to talk to me about my compensation requirements and asked for two references. Over the next several days she spoke to my references, which the recruiter later told me went well.5. I wait several days thinking they are putting the offer together. After not hearing anything I contact the recruiter. She tells me that the hiring manager quit out of the blue and that they won't be able to make me a formal offer because the hiring manager's boss doesn't want me to start without a manager in place. This didn't make sense to me. Why not just have me start and learn from the team until a new manager is in place? Or why not tell me I can start once they hire a new manager? Also, when hiring someone you aren't hiring the person solely for the role but because he/she is good for the company and will add value in the long-term, so why take back a verbal offer and why not just let me start? This was an extremely frustrating experience because I had essentially committed to FB once they made me the verbal offer, but apparently FB didn't commit to me. After getting the verbal offer, I also canceled interviews with other companies, told numerous people (family, friends, coworkers) that I got a new job, and even had a celebratory dinner with my friends.6. FB then wasted my time again by letting me interview for another finance role several weeks later, which I knew wasn't a fit with my experience and knew I wasn't going to get. I ultimately never made it past the first round.This is feedback on Facebook's recruiting and hiring process. If you make a verbal offer, stick to it. FB may think that a verbal offer is not the same as a formal offer obviously, but in my years of experience as long as the candidate has a good reference check, which I did, the high high majority of the time, a verbal offer turns into a formal offer. And at least personally apologize for putting a candidate through this process instead of sending a generic rejection email.7. To top it off, I recently learned that the FB recruiter that I had been working with used my name to connect with my friend that works at another company to try to get a strong candidate (that had interviewed at FB but ultimately didn't get the role) who was interested in a finance role at my friend's company, a referral for the role. I guess the FB recruiter wanted to help this person out because FB felt bad that they couldn't give this person an offer at FB.To all reading I just want to let you know that this is what went down for me while recruiting with Facebook.

**************************************Business Operations Analyst**************************************
I found out about the position through a referral. The recruiting process consisted of several phone and an onsite interview. About half the interviews were with the business operations team, and the other half were with members of the advertising sales teams I would be working with closely. All the interviews were case questions: the interviewer would present a business problem that they were working on, and we talked through…  how to think about it and go about solving it. The recruiters were very responsive, usually getting back to me within 24 hours of a voicemail or email. Overall, the interview process was a very positive experience for me.

Several rounds of interview, all very standard with competency based questioning. Was interviewed by potential team mates which was handy. Got to the final round of interviews (3 in succession) and was very pleased with how they went. Was told that it was the final round, yet after getting a phone call with feedback I was told that actually there was another round afterwards. The global head of the division…  wanted a video interview from US. I was surprised but went along anyway. Interview was a bit of a disaster and it really came across that she didn't think I was suitable for the role and didn't want me hired, which is why the final-final round came about. Disappointed as I know I had the skills and was a good fit for the company, but no point arguing about it, just felt the process wasn't as transparent as it could have been.

**************************************Software Engineering Intern**************************************
I originally had applied to Facebook through their online portal. After a few weeks of no response I reached out to a recruiter at a Facebook event and she saw my resume. After I convinced her I was ready for the interviews, she set up my first phone interview of three total.After the interviewer gave a fairly long intro of his bg I was asked several behavioral questions. I was…  asked why I picked Facebook, what is my field of interest, and had to discuss a project of mine.At this point we reached the technical portion. He asked me the following question.Q: Given a number n, return a number formed from the same digits of n that is the number right before n. Example: Given 1342, you must return the number 1324.After this we spent a fairly lengthy period of time talking about coding habits, facebook, push cycles, and other production related questions I asked.At the end of this interview I felt terrible, I thought I'd completely failed it because I only answered one question. I couldn't sleep all night, but then the next day itself I received an e-mail saying I'd passed to the second round. They asked if I wanted some time to brush up before going in for my final interview. I asked for a week and prepared.My second interviewer called from a conference room due to which the sound quality was a bit off. We talked and she asked me a few similar questions to the first interviewer delving into my background, projects, and my schoolwork. Eventually we began the coding questions.The first question was the LCA problem with no parent pointers. I immediately started analyzing the problem's base cases for recursion, determined an optimum algorithm that covered all cases, and wrote the solution before coding. After explaining it and running through test examples I began coding the solution. After coding it, I spent a fair amount of time proving my code works with the interviewer before she accepted it worked. We had approximately 15 minutes left at this point so he said we can begin another problem before ending five minutes early, a statement I was confused by.The second question was to design a method to store really large numbers that exceed 64 bits, and then to write a method that can add two of these numbers. I began coding and had just finished the code when he said we ran out of time. He asked me about any questions I had and seemed to be in a hurry so I asked a few questions then the interview ended.At this point I waited for approximately 2 weeks after I sent two emails to my recruiter asking about the feedback from the interview. I was asked to do a third phone interview with a product team member as the engineers had noted I was interested in product development. I was a bit confused but happy overall to still be in the running. We scheduled it for a few days later and I went in relaxed.In the interview, I was asked why Facebook, a project of mine, which field I'm interested in and why, followed by a technical question. I coded in Java although she mentioned she hadn't used Java in a while so she didn't care as much about the syntax.The first question was the classic anagram question. I described two solutions, one using a HashTable and one relying on bucketsort. I coded both methods and did a complexity analysis before she expanded the problem. Now rather than checking if two strings were anagrams, I had to group a list of strings by anagram grouping. I described how we could use a Hashtable to store the sorted string as a key, and have the original string be contained in the value as a linked lists. After writing the algorithm out in pseudocode she said I didn't have to implement it in Java and that she believed it would work. After a complexity analysis she then asked me this mix of behavioral technical questions.What would you do if Mark Zuckerberg came to your desk and told you Facebook was slow and he wanted you to fix it.She then asked me to describe a product I'd design if I worked at Facebook. I mentioned several related to data analytical tools for Facebook users on their own data. I mentioned the benefit to users before naming another idea involving querying newsfeed for posts related to the topics described in the query.After this she asked me if I had any questions for her before she told me that my recruiter would get back to me within a week. I waited three days before I received an e-mail from my recruiter that she wanted to talk for a few minutes if I had time. I immediately responded I was free and she called me shortly after.She then gave me my offer for an internship in Menlo Park, described the components of the compensation, and explained briefly the process involved with the internship. Afterwards she asked me if I had any questions. I was too blown away so I just said I'd email her once I think of questions before we ended the call. I accepted that night.

I applied through my school career services office and was scheduled for a phone screen. The phone screen consisted of two pretty easy questions. Afterwards, I was flown out to Menlo Park for a full day at Facebook's campus. The on-site was just one interview followed by a few hours of tours and free food.

I was contacted by a recruiter after dropping my resume at the career fair. After 2 phone screens, I was invited to attend a 'University Day' at the Menlo Park office for one onsite interview. Each phone screen is generally about 45 minutes long and consists of 2-3 programming questions to be coded on Collabedit. The recruiter and interviewers were very helpful and extremely organized.

Applied through campus, had an on-campus interview and an on-site interview. Both were technical and had 1-2 questions. On campus interview was followed by a tour of the campus and some tech talks. Interviewers seemed more focused on thought process than whether I reached a correct answer. Overall questions were not too difficult.

I was referred by an employee and received an email reply within 48 hours (Oct 28). My recruiter set up a phone screen within the week. It was a 45 minute technical interview that I found a solution for. Again, within 48 hours I received an email saying that I passed.Facebook gave me an option of three "University day" on-site interview dates, each about a week apart from each other.…  I chose the last date, Dec 3rd, almost a month later. Facebook will cover all of your traveling fees, so no worries about the cost of flying across the country. The internship on-sites start with one 45-minute interview, then lunch (good food!), then a tour, then a quick presentation about why Facebook employees love working at FB, then an open Q&A with new FB employees.By chance, my recruiter was hosting the interview group, so I got a super early-bird heads up that I received an offer before I even left FB headquarters! From what I gather by talking to other interviewees, you might have to wait 3 or 4 days to hear back from your recruiter. Good luck, everyone!

Met a recruiter at an on campus job fair. Got contacted a week later regarding an on campus interview.

I was contacted by a FB representative, and had to do two interview. One on my college campus, and in HQ. Questions were relatively straightforward algorithm questions, combined with programming. They do not require tons of technical knowledge, just thinkingabout the program, problem solving, and coding. It was a very good experience overall.

I met them at a career fair at my school and handed them my resume. A couple weeks later they emailed me and asked if I could interview on my campus. 45 minute interview. A few days later they asked if I wanted to come to Menlo Park for a final round interview. In Menlo I had a 45 minute interview followed by a long tour of the Menlo Park…  campus. It was a really fun time.

-Got contacted by recruiter with an offer to go through full-time position interview process.-Changed FTE to intern-2 phone interviews-Offer with ability to select any start date in 2013.

I applied for the position when Facebook was interviewing on campus. Emailed my resume on the deadline, called up for interview within 5 days. After passing the first interview, I was informed that evening that I had a second interview the next day. After that, it was about a week or so before I heard back, and since I was a graduate student the third and last stage was to…  match me with a particular group. Within a few days of the matching process (done via phone) I received my offer letter.The two on-campus interviews consisted of writing down actual code (in my case, I used Java) and they were fairly basic and specific data structures related questions.

Contacted by recruiter who found my profile online. Had a chat with their university recruiter, then two 45-minute on-campus interviews. First one consisted of two relatively straightforward coding questions (but had some bugs in solution to second question, which were spotted and corrected). Second interview consisted of talking about prior projects for first ~20 minutes, then two algorithm questions (asked for hints on the first one), then I got to…  ask questions. Had lunch with an intern friend.

Submitted my application to College recruiters. Recruiters were very friendly and outgoing. They had hosted several events on campus and seemed to want to get to know there candidates Got an email requesting an on-campus technical interview 3 weeks later. I interviewed with them, and was contacted that evening for a second interview the next day. After that interview, I heard back from the company 4 days later with an…  offer, and the recruiter was more interested in asking me what I wanted from the company as opposed to trying to press me for an answer. I was invited to fly down to their headquarters to visit their Palo Alto branch and get a better feel for the company.

Was contacted by a recruiter after submitting my CV online. She was very friendly and gave me an online programming test, followed by two technical phone interviews.These phone interviews were with software engineers from the US and lasted 45min to 1 hour. We used collabedit so that they could see my code. After discussing my background briefly, they went through an easy question followed by a more difficult question.

Submitted interview online. Phone screen. Know your algorithms and data structures, know how to solve common Computer Science (technical) questions that are used in interviews. However, knowing and being able to solve a problem isn't enough; you need to do it quickly, within 20 minutes or so.

I was contacted by a recruiter via a Facebook hackathon I attended. Scheduled a phone screen the next week. My interviewer called me 30 minutes before my scheduled phone time and caught me off guard. The phone screen was pretty standard and they asked me the usual data structures questions.

Popular algorithmic questions . A few puzzles.

First HR person contact me and asked to solve few puzzles and then she contacted me and asked easy questions and scheduled a date for an technical interview.

**************************************Client Solutions Analyst**************************************
I was contacted by a recruiter, followed by an interview and a writing test. The test was mainly about your language skills (for specific position) and problem solving for a specific case. About a week later, I was arranged an face-to-face interview with Facebook representative at their office. The questions are about your profile, your understanding of the job and your interest.

**************************************Program Coordinator**************************************
First a fairly simple and straight forward phone interview lasting about 30 minutes.The second interview was at FB headquarters and a rotation of three different employees on the team interviewing for 30 minutes each in a 1 on 1 setting. Most were straight forward but some were a bit difficult to answer--take your time and think out your answer before blurting just anything out.

**************************************Analyst-User Operations**************************************
I applied in the careers of Facebook and received a mail from them asking me to give a written test of 2 questions which tests our vocabulary and communication skills.I cleared that and am about to give a telephonic round.

**************************************Quantitative Scientist**************************************
They contacted me out of the blue with a position that they felt was a good fit for me. Then they set me up with a tech interview over the phone. The tech guy was late, and on a noisy phone and didn't really sound motivated... My HR contact called me the next day and told me they had found a better match... Then he called me a week later…  and told me they had found a better match ;)

**************************************Cyber Analyst**************************************
Applied through online website career section. Contacted via email and then phone call to confirm interview. Had a technical recruiter call me and we talked for 30 minutes about basic IT network information. Simple questions on how protocols work and explain the two way process for a web browser from a users point of view.Was told I would be moved along to the next technical interview since i answered all…  the questions very well. Called and emailed a week later to confirm or find out why a follow up had not been scheduled. No response from recruiter or scheduler with either email or phone. Very poorly handled process after first contact.

**************************************Senior Account Manager**************************************
Good interview process. I think that the overall feel was professional, courtios and a very good conversation about the marketplace and about my qualifications overall. I would recommend to friends and peers.

**************************************Product Design Manager**************************************
Contacted by recruiter, given a very professional screening phone call. Attended two full day interview sessions with the teams. The office is lovely and the team was bright and talented. However, the commute from Marin County made accepting the position not possible.

**************************************Customer Sucess Manager**************************************
Initial call with recruiter, to check if my profile is fitting for the job description; and then a call with a team member with the same role, focusing more on my current experience and motivations

**************************************Manager, Risk Operations**************************************
I applied for this position online and heard back from a recruiter within one week. The phone interview/pre-screen process was typical and fairly common, consisting of basic questions about my background and resume. After the initial phone interview I was scheduled to complete a phone interview with someone else.One week later the phone interview with the hiring manager took place. The interview was fairly basic and straightforward. It seemed more…  conversational than a list of pre-determined questions. The interviewer seemed preoccupied and aloof, which immediately turned me off.One week later I received an email letting me know that they were pursuing other candidates.

**************************************Head of User Experience**************************************
Six months of them trying to define and redefine the role. Eight individual interviews followed by an in person formal presentation and 5 more individual interviews. Interviewed by junior folks for senior role.

**************************************Analytics**************************************
Applied online soon after FB advertised that they want to hire more women. Got an email several months later from an HR recruiter asking me for a time and day to interview. I responded via email that day indicating some times and days that would work. Never heard back from the FB recruiter.

**************************************Client Service Associate**************************************
I was referred by a friend and former classmate for this position. Several days later I was contacted by an HR associate for a first-round screening interview. Typical interview questions, with a heavy emphasis on "Why do you want to work at Facebook?" Given that I was employed at the time and not a new hire fresh out of college, I got the sense that there was extra pressure to…  map the skills I had gained in the workplace on to the job description. I have to stress that I really though I aced this interview. The recruiter told me she'd pass my resume on to a local hiring manager, who would be in touch to schedule a second round. About a week later, I got a note from the recruiter informing me that Facebook had decided not to move forward with my candidacy, and inviting me to apply again later. I suspect the reason I was not hired had to do with my coming off as a flight risk (since I was trying to leave a job less than a year after starting).

**************************************Product Designer**************************************
First Round: Chat with a recruiter a little bit. Very simple.Second Round: They have you chat with two designers via video conference for 45mins, back to back. One designer will walk through your portfolio with you, another will critique an app with you. I'd suggest you keep your portfolio presentation to 30 mins bc they'll interrupt with questions.Third Round: Follow up with a recruiter where she tells you what they…  liked and didn't like. They feed you a ton of info and critiques! Don't get overwhelmed by it.Fourth Round: On-site. 25-minute portfolio review and then a bunch of one-on-ones. Try to be unique in your portfolio presentation. They watch a lot of these so be a little creative. More importantly, make sure the story makes sense. If your story comes off jagged then people will lose interest.

The process involved a recruiter call, followed by two on-site 45 min interviews (portfolio and product critique,) because I live in the area. The next step was a longer set of on-site interviews that included a 30 minute presentation of my latest work, a discussion about my background and personality, a product critique (Yelp) and problem solving exercise. A week later, I received an offer by phone.

Heard about a position through someone who works at the company, recruiter contacted me the following week and was very helpful telling me about the opportunities on the various teams that are hiring. The recruiter then handed me off to another recruiter who handled the phone interviews.This is where the interview process went south fast. It took the recruiter 3 weeks to get this setup and throughout the process did…  not update me on what was going on. I had to email the recruiter several times about an update after each week of radio silence.Phone interviews went great, had video conference calls with 2 separate designers: one focused on app critique and the other on portfolio review. Had a positive experience with both of them, luckily the interview where back to back.Once the interviews were over I did not hear back from the recruiter even though I followed up and asked about what to expect for the next steps. I had to wait another 3 weeks before I heard from the recruiter and said they wanted to continue onto the onsite interview. She then handed me off to the onsite recruiter.The onsite recruiter was also problematic. After responding to their email right away each time, it took an entire week to nail down a date to chat about the onsite process. I waited for their call and they never called, I even followed up with them right away and didn't get a response until that night with an excuse of "my phone died" and they didn't even bother to apologize. After several back and forth, I got the onsite interview setup.The onsite interview was by far the best experience. They arranged for an Uber to pick me up from and take me home. The onsite was a portfolio review, an group app critique, lunch interview, whiteboard exercise ("rethink the ATM") and a background interview with a hiring manager. The hiring manager asked if we could spend more time talking after I time was up and they gave me a tour of the building and talked up the benefits of working at Facebook. I left feeling positive and the hiring manager even gave me pointers when looking for a team within Facebook.I followed up with the recruiter the same day and didn't hear back until over a week later. They ended up saying "No Hire" but wanted to keep my profile on file (unsure why).Overall, my experience was terrible given that it took 3 months to do the entire process and the recruiters were the worst part. The actual teams were great and seemed like great people I'd want to work with. Hopefully they can sort out their recruiters.

I had a weird sort of non-experience with a Facebook recruiter:- Recruiter emailed mentioning that I'd not replied to earlier message from a colleague (I searched my inbox but didn't find any earlier messages)- Agreed to an initial call to hear about what they're working on- 5 mins past our scheduled call time received an email from the recruiter saying something urgent had come up, but recruiter would have a…  manager look over my work (I'd not shared any work) and decide how to proceed- Next day received an email thanking me for taking the time to speak (I'd not spoken with anyone), but that they'd decided to move ahead with another candidateI looked up the recruiter on LinkedIn, and they've only been at Facebook for a few months so I'm guessing that this isn't the typical experience!

I was recruited through LinkedIn. There was a bit of disjointedness as I was handed off to various recruiters and personnel throughout the process.There was an initial phone screening, then a video interview with 2 product designers, and then finally an on-site where I gave a presentation to several product designers, then had a whiteboarding session, followed by 2 1-on-1 interviews and then lunch with a designer.They were eager to…  set up each phase of the interview process but very slow to follow up. After my video interview it was 3 weeks before I heard that they wanted to move forward. Most frustratingly, after my on-site interview they never got in touch at all. So I assume they were not interested, but did not have the courtesy to even tell me so.

I did a phone screen with a recruiter, shortly after I went onsite (I requested the first round to be onsite) and I did 2 meetings, one was an overview of my past work, one was an app critique. The next day I was already told they would invite me onsite again. My meeting had 5 parts – a presentation to 6-8 designers, problem solving on whiteboard, another app critique,…  lunch with a designer, and discussing my background with a product design manager.

Initial phone screen with recruiter, followed by a video conference interview with 2 designers. I presented a few portfolio projects to the first interviewer, then critiqued an iPhone app with the second interviewer. I was then brought on-site in Palo Alto for a final interview, where I presented more portfolio work, met with designers and design managers, and completed a number of short design challenges.

Had 2 phone screens then met with a manager in person. Afterwards I flew out to Menlo Park for an onsite interview. The entire process was incredible. Onsite took a full day. The recruiting team arranged flights, hotels, and reimbursed me for any cab fare. The very next day I was told that I would receive an offer. After receiving an offer I had multiple people reach out to me…  to make sure I had all my questions answered. The entire process was top notch. I had competing offers but this process was one of the factors that pushed me to ultimately choose Facebook. For such a large company to handle recruiting so seamlessly was an incredible feat in itself. A+ Experience.

Overall this was a terrible experience. The internal design recruiter at Facebook cancelled, missed or rescheduled a total of 4 times over the course of 3 weeks. Once I was cancelled on an hour before the call. Another time I was waiting for the call and it never came, then when I emailed to find out what happened I was told they double booked me, or another time they got…  the wrong day. The attitude throughout seemed like I had to be on their schedule, and they were doing me a favor almost, even thought they'd repeatedly tell me how interested they are in my work. As 'interested' as they were, recruiter had no understanding for what I specialized in or what my company did. They never asked if I was interviewing with anyone else (which I was, two other big tech company in SF). Finally when I did the in-person interviews, those went as expected. Then again following the in-persona interviews they didn't reach out to me with their decision. I had to contact them a week later to find out that they had decided to move on. This process we demeaning, extremely unprofessional, and compared to all the other companies I interviewed with, was probably the most impersonal. All my years in the bay, I've never experienced anything like this.

I responded to a recruiter for a Product Designer position. After an initial call with the recruiter, I had two separate interviews back to back. During the first interview, the focus is on process and a portfolio review. You are asked to pick two projects to walkthrough your decisions and involvement. During the second interview, you are tasked with critiquing a real world app through a specific use-case.

The whole process was very fast and fun.Had two video-conferences: First was to critique an App (had Yelp) with 2 designers, second to walk another designer through a project on my portfolio.Onsite interview started out with a portfolio presentation for around 6 or 7 designers. Then I had 1-1 with them to discuss my work, experience and also space to ask my own questions. I also had to critique another…  app and do a whiteboard design exercise with 2 designers. Fun!The experience was awesome and kinda of made me realize how important it is to know what questions to ask. Those questions can probably tell a lot about you, as much as your answers to their questions.

Was reached out to by a recruiter via linkedin. Spoke to the recruiter then had a call with two members of the design team. Everyone was very nice and cordial and the process went smooth, they just told me they realized they needed someone with a slightly different skillset. I respect that.

I was first screened by the recruiter. I then had two, 45 minute, interviews with two different product designers. The first call was to walk them through my portfolio. The second call was to critique an app on my phone. I received Yelp.

*I still haven't accepted the offer; Glassdoor automatically adds "Yes, and I accepted" when you say you've received and offer :-)*Facebook interview starts with a recruiter phone screen, two phone interviews with designers, and then a full onsite interview.I was interviewing with another company when Facebook reached out to me so I didn't have to go through the phone interviews. I was flown in for the full interview, which was…  a fun experience! My interviewers were friendly, humble, and genuinely interested in talking to me.The day started off with a 30 min panel presentation of my portfolio work. It's really challenging to consolidate your work in such a short presentation. I was only able to get through 1 major project.1 on 1: Product Critique - a popular mobile app1 on 1: Product Thinking exercise - whiteboarding a solution to a design problem - this is actually a lot of fun! I think the goal is to understand how you approach designing something rather than coming up with a novel solution. I didn't have a fully designed wireframe or anything, but I did have a scenario of what the full experience might be.1 on 1: Chat with a Design Manager.

I first had a portfolio review at a school portfolio review event then got emails for a next rounds of interviews. Had to pick 1 or 2 projects and share with them in details. Asked me how I would further develop some projects and asked about thinking process as well.

I was asked to do a phone screen with the recruiter. For the phone screen, I did a mistake. I was researching on google what they would want to know and thought they would want to hear about my work. So I focused so much on polishing the detail of the work, but it turned out the 1st phone screening is more general, and he was asking more general questions,…  which I didn't quite enjoy. I know I didn't do the good job, but feel a little awkward that I got screened by the recruiter, not by the designer.

I applied independently but didn't hear a response until my friend referred me. The interview process itself was very quick because I was waiting on another interview result from Google. There was no big design challenge to prepare for so I focused a lot on my past work presentation. The critique and problem solving was pretty quick and fun.

I had an on-campus interview (portfolio review) that was followed by a product critique over the phone that came many weeks later (their interviewing schedule was evidently full). I was invited onsite after this, where I presented my portfolio to a group of five or six designers and managers before having one-on-one interviews with the same group. These interviews included another portfolio review and another product critique, as well as…  a design challenge and a more behavioral interview.

For such a large company, Facebook moves fast. I started talking to them end of October and received an offer in mid November. This is an unusually fast and fantastic pace for such a large company!The process was simple starting with a phone call from a hiring manager. Then I spoke to a recruiter which went over the next couple steps: 1) portfolio walk through (phone call), 2) product critique…  (phone call), 3) onsite interview where I spoke to about 5 different designers and product managers across the organization. I ended my onsite interview with a nice campus tour and some ice cream which sealed the deal for me. About 4 days later I got a call from the recruiter letting me know the details of the offer and start dates available. It was that fast! I joined two weeks later.The entire process was probably one of the best interview processes I had ever been through. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful throughout.

My time interviewing with Facebook was one of the best recruiting experiences I've ever had. Everyone was kind and supportive through the process, and the atmosphere was generally comfortable.I attended a Facebook event at my university. I started off with two brief portfolio reviews, followed by 1 interview to critique an app. After that, I was brought on site to knock out 5 interviews with current product designers and a…  product design manager.In my process, I found it important to focus not just on the experience in the context of the projects that you're showing, but also in your interactions with the team. Listen carefully and think through your design decisions in the exercises. Demonstrate your empathy and understanding of the product space. Prepare yourself well! The onsite interview is very exhilarating and intensive so make sure you're well rested before a day of great conversations.

Had three interviews including a phone call with a FB recruiter followed by two skype interviews with current designers from different locations. First interview I had with the designer was about my projects and she was not actively responding to my explanation which made it hard for me to lead the conversation. Second designer I talked with was very understanding and showed good reaction to my opinion. It was more…  pleasant two-way conversation, not like the previous one. I'm glad I could do face to face skype interview with the second designer for the app critique interview.

I was contacted by a recruiter by email. After an initial chat over the phone with the recruiter, I interviewed with two different designers over the phone. The first reviewed my work, went over why I made certain decisions, and spoke a little about the projects at Facebook. The second was a critique of a mobile app that you both have on your phone.If they invite you onsite for a…  full day, you'll speak with a handful of designers and managers. You'll present your latest and greatest portfolio projects in 30 minutes. Then you split up into 1-on-1 interviews with people from the panel. Each piece is different. You'll dive deeper into a portfolio project. Another session may ask you to redesign a remote control. You'll also critique a mobile app again and be asked about how you'll go about figuring out strategy for a redesign. For lunch, someone will take you around the campus and let you ask any questions.Overall, the process left me wanting to learn more about the company. The entire day is very casual — they do a great job making sure the candidate feels comfortable and in their element.

I saw Facebook had portfolio review time after the conference at out school, so I submitted my site. Luckily got selected, and a product designer talked with me for 15 mins after the conference. Couple days later, I receive an email about their interest in second phone interview. All the email are replied very fast and smoothly. During the phone interview, we talked about apple calendar app, google calendar a…  little. I didn't get the offer, but the experience was pretty nice.

A group of Product Designers came to my school and I got the chance to get my Portfolio reviewed by one of the Designers, she liked my work and few days later I got an e-mail asking if I would be interested in a formal job interview with Facebook.It was a two-hour phone interview with to different Product Design Managers.First interview was about my own work, and the key there…  is to know the in and outs of your work, you have to be able to defend all your design choices.Second interview was about a random Mobile Application, I got the Twitter Mobile Application, the key here is to come up with a solution for some of the features, or missing features, and backup your possible solution with data. Here they are really trying to find out how you think, and how good you are finding multiple solutions to a certain problem.

Had three phone interviews. The first was with the HR recruiter. The second was with a product designer and we discussed my work. The third was with another product designer and we critiqued an app / service.

Got in contact with a lead designer, who referred me to a HR Recruiter.I interviewed over the phone with two designers and then flew into Menlo Park for a set of onsite interviews. The time at menlo was nice, they covered expenses and took good care of me.All in all, the people were very friendly, and the process was well explained.

I was approached by a recruiter via email. After 2 rounds of phone screens (first with a recruiter, pretty generic; second with a designer, a product critique), I went onsite. There was a portfolio review, followed by several interviews with the people who attended it. One whiteboard exercise, one product critique which felt like a repetition of the product critique I had done over the phone.

Was contacted by a recruiter and met for first round of interviews where we briefly went over my portfolio. The format was they interview me first, then I interview them. Afterwards I received a follow-up email and after some scheduling difficulties did a phone interview where I was asked to critique a mobile app.

I was initially contacted by a recruiter then screened by him for 45 minutes. After that 2 other 45 minute phone calls, one reviewing a popular app the other going over my work. I was then asked to fly out to Menlo Park and spend a day at FB HQ where I first presented my work to the group that would then individually interview me for about 45 minutes each.Everyone…  was extremely friendly and insightful. I actually had a great time talking design with everyone involved, it was like chatting design with close friends. They were very prepared and helped me be myself the whole time through. I would suggest to get tons of rest the night before, excitement can get exhausting towards the end.

The process began by talking with a recruiter. I then had two initial 1:1's before doing a day long interview with around 6-7 people throughout the day.This was a mixture of me showing my work to a group and then problem solving with one or two other people. I also met with other designers for lunch to discuss how things work at Facebook. The afternoon was a mixture of design…  critiques and explorations of what I'd like to achieve in the position. It was an enjoyable day considering it was an interview.Afterwards I had a number of follow up 1:1 skype calls with various people from around the company to broaden the topics we spoke about and see different parts of the business.

Applied through requiters visiting my college. Met with an alumna who was currently an employee. We had a very relaxed and productive conversation about design as a whole, working at Facebook, and my work. I was contacted a few days later about a follow up interview. The requiter was always helpful and kind. Spoke to a woman on the marketing team in an hour long phone interview. She seemed cold,…  but possibly was trying to show no inflection in her voice to keep the interview neutral. She asked about a few specific projects in my portfolio, and asked follow up questions on how I would adjust the design based on different hypothetical criteria.Was contacted around a week later from my requiter notifying me that I would not be moving forward with the process. I asked for a follow up conversation to get feedback, which was granted. During that conversation, I was told my main reason for being passed on was that I did not have enough experience. This struck a chord with me because the whole time they were pitching at my college, they said they were only looking for people with potential.

First meet at a job affair, the interviewer will ask you to talk about your portfolio and ask you some questions. Second, for the phone interview, the interviewer will ask you to talk about yourself and your recent projects.

The interview process was really long (over a month). A recruiter first contacted me, and then I had three phone interviews. Each of them were about 30-45 minutes long. The last interview was on-site at Facebook HQ with about eight product designers, and it lasted about four hours total. The entire group reviewed my portfolio work, and then smaller groups of them asked me questions.

First call with a recruiter with basic questions on my experience, interest in Facebook, and what I was looking for in a position.Second call with a Product Designer from Facebook where I introduced myself and what I was doing now. He asked some product strategy questions like "Should Facebook continue to add features or rely on 3rd party apps?".At no time did anyone look at my design work or ask…  me about product design decisions or process. I interviewed at another company that gave me the chance to remotely present my design work in the screening process and then flew me in for a round of in-person interviews.I came away wondering if Facebook lacks strong UX management as no part of the interview process focused on Product Design, design process, or product impact.

I was headhunted by Facebook. My first interaction with them was a call with a recruiter from the Menlo Park office who knew very little about design. A few days later I had a really great 90 minute interview / chat with a design manager in the Menlo Park office. After that, he put me straight through to the final round of interviews and asked me to fly out to…  California for onsite interviews. However I decided I'd be more interested in their London office instead of Menlo Park, so I got transferred to their London recruitment.A couple of months later I had a video call with a recruiter from London who was much more knowledgable in design. She put me through to two 45 minute interviews with designers in London, which I was a bit surprised about, as it seemed like the recruitment process I went through in Menlo Park counted for nothing in London.The first interview was an app critique which I enjoyed. The interviewer was very bubbly and worked hard to sell me on London and Facebook. However my second interview was incredibly disappointing and put me off the role entirely.The interviewer was very negative about pretty much everything. It felt like he would rather be somewhere else. Both these interviewers were also from a team I had expressed no interest in, so during this phase I learned nothing about the team I had genuine interest for.The recruiter got back to me promptly and said I wasn't a good fit for the roles they were looking for at that time. She asked for feedback on the interview process so I emailed her a longer version of what I said above.I never heard back from her. Clearly they don't like getting critical feedback of their interview process, so now I know all I need to know about Facebook!

I was contacted by a recruiter, and there were three phone interviews in total. It was overall a really positive experience - the recruiter was really friendly and helpful, and the phone interviews each lasted about 45 mins, with 15 mins for me to ask any questions I had.I got an email from the recruiter asking if I would be interested in product design opportunities, and then there was a…  screening call in which she gathered some basic information about me, asked a few questions about my work experience and skill set, explained the interview process and answered any queries I had. Then a few days later I received an email scheduling the next phone interview.The interviewer was a designer at Facebook - pretty friendly, and explained what he was currently working on, and then asked me what phone I was using. Then I was asked to put on headphones and keep the phone in front of me and answer very specific questions for about half an hour, about iOS settings, and methods of measuring user engagement, etc. There was also a hypothetical design problem given to me, and I had to then defend my design decisions and justify why I chose each interaction that I did.The next interview was scheduled a couple of weeks later, and that was supposed to be a critique of my work - but it was pretty conversational, and basically an opportunity for me to explain recent projects that I had enjoyed most. And on a specific project, I was asked to explain at length my design process and UX decisions, and whether there was anything I would have done differently. This was also followed by a friendly discussion of the work culture, and I was asked if I had any questions. Didn't make it to the on-site interview (which would have been a presentation of work, followed by interviews with a panel of five people), but it was overall an enjoyable experience, having to think on your feet etc.

First of all, I'm located far from FB offices, so interviews were by phone.First interview with Product Design hiring manager not more than 30 minutes. Some common questions to understand if I fit the position, is it interesting for me, etc. Very nice person easy to talk with. She was totally ok with moving interview time to adjust to my time zone and was just in time.After one week I…  got second interview with a Product Designer which lasted 55 minutes.Some background related questions, the process of my work, etc. Then she picked one of my projects and asked many questions like why did you do this or that, why this order, how to do this or that action, do you need to teach your user to do it, etc. This interviewer was more serious lady, but made a good impression either.To be honest I thought it went well, but after one more week I got a mail from Product Design hiring manager, that we're not going to continue, I don't fit the position.She gladly agreed to have another call to give me a feedback on my interview, which I really appreciate! The reason is I think more about how it looks rather then how it works.Lately I analysed the project I was asked about, it had problems with OS guidelines, I used some stuff from Android world in iOS app.I'll fix it, add more properly made projects to portfolio and will try again.Good luck everyone )

**************************************Product Management**************************************
was informal though very vague in volunteering more info.was not clear what qualities were more important than others.age for sure. I did research about a new initiative they have I have heard from my refferal.they are looking to find passion for social goals they target.

**************************************Fraud Investigator**************************************
I applied online through Facebook.com and was contacted by phone for what seemed to be pre-screening interview. The questions consisted of my current job, a few questions about why Facebook, and why am I looking for employment elsewhere. Another phone interview with an Investigator at Facebook. A few scenario questions about how I would approach a specific task, and a lot of "Tell me about a time...." questions. Definitely need…  to do your homework about Facebook, and be able to come up with ideas on how to combat it. On the day of the interview at the Palo Alto headquarters, there were two additional in person interviews with another Investigator and and Senior Investigator.The Investigators seemed very young, either in their early 20's but no older than 30. The questions pertained to fraudulent activity with Facebook credits, and how a perpetrator would benefit with Facebook credits. Highly recommended to research Facebook credits. I believe that this is the part when the interview almost seemed like ideas that would help Facebook do their jobs by obtaining ideas for free. You would think that an interview would be to evaluate if the person has the ability to adapt to the company's philosophy or be able to articulate ideas. I may not have been right on point with Facebook credits, but I felt I displayed a great deal of professionalism and knowledge of the field of Fraud. There were a lot of questions of how you would approach fraud on Facebook credits, and the ideas that I presented and how I would approach the issue were reasonable and developed well.I did not get the job, which seemed odd to me because I have more experience in the industry than the interviewers put together. During their introduction, they both shared where they came from before Facebook, and both said that it was their first job out of college, 6 months ago, and 2 years ago. However, they were professional and courteous, and seemed very knowledgeable in their fields.

**************************************Data Scientist Intern**************************************
Met a recruiter at a college career fair. About 1 week later, I did the first of two technical phone interviews.

**************************************Client Partner**************************************
I submitted my resume online, and was called by a recruiter a little over a week later. The recruiter call went well. I was even told how impressive my experiences are and that I should expect a call from the hiring manager within the next few days. A week later, no call. Reached back out to the recruiter, no response.. so... yeah.

I was referred by a friend that works for Facebook, who submitted my resume. Two days later, I was contacted by a recruiter to set up time for a phone interview. During the 30 minute call, we went over my background and sales experience. The second round interview was a phone interview with the hiring manager, which took about the same time. The interview was similar to the first one…  and consisted of general background questions. The final round of interviews took place at HQ, which was three 1:1 interviews, and one 1:2 mock sales pitch. Less than a week later, I was told I got the offer, which I was very excited to accept.The whole process (from resume submission to offer) took about 3 weeks. I was recruiting at the top tech firms during this time and my experience at Facebook was by far the smoothest, fastest, and most professionally conducted (a pleasant surprise). It was because of this (along with the very attractive comp package) that I decided to accept the Facebook offer and I could not be happier!

I felt the interview process was handled very well. It went smoothly and the I felt the recruiting team communicated clearly and regularly with me. I had one phone interview with the recruiter followed by a phone interview with the hiring manger in CA. I was then brought in to meet with 5 people in the Austin office.

Multiple rounds of 1:1, then a group presentation. Then an additional series of 1:1 interviews where they are seeking different ways to get at the core of what motivates you and drives you.

Recruitment person had quite poor English so understanding her was difficult. Process took about 6 weeks with long delays in between calls and face to face.The line manager who eventually interviewed me was quite arrogant and unclear as to what he was looking to achieve I found.

The interview process seemed to resemble a marathon race more than an interview for a job at a tech company - 3 months of interviewing which were comprised of:1. Phone interview with a recruiter from the Ireland office2. In-office interview with hiring manager (30 min)3. In-office interview with another manager in the office, not related to the job (30 min)4. In-office presentation (10 min) about a case based on a…  potential client - goal is to pitch how and why Facebook marketing is relevant for that client. The cases were a digital bank trying to target a specific market segment and also switch clients to online banking. The other case was an e-commerce merchant thinking of penetrating a new territory.5. Step 4 followed on the same day by an interview with the hiring manager's manager (30 minutes)6. Penultimate round of interviews with local office's managerI didn't make it past step 6 - after that there's a final interview with an MD of the greater area. Only one candidate passes to that round.I had to chase the recruiter throughout the process to know if I made it to the next rounds - twice, it was when I called her that I learned I passed and she then referred me to schedule the next interview. VERY unprofessional, completely NOT what I would expect from a company with such reputation and stature. The process seemed tedious for no good reason, too many short, shallow interviews - it's as if there's no power of hiring for the hiring manager.

30 minutes each, with 4 separate people, each one asked different things - one about teamwork/cooperation, one about sales knowledge, one about client services skills/wins/difficult situations, one more about general skills/fit.

Unfortunately I had an extremely unprofessional experience with a facebook recruiter, which turned out to be an utter disgrace. I knew a recruiter at facebook and dropped them an email for a position i saw. No response. I followed up with another email, but this time copying in a senior facebook employee. I got a response within 30 min saying that she wasn't the recruiter who looked after this position,…  but her colleague. Emailed him and we agreed to schedule a telephone interview the following Monday.On Monday at the agreed time, no call. Turned out that Monday was a bank holiday in Ireland. Can happen, perhaps he forgot when we scheduled the call so I dropped him an email to reschedule the calI. I was surprised to see that I got his OOO message saying he was on holidays for the entire week?! I was flabbergasted. A bank holiday, sure maybe he forgot about that, but if you go on a holiday abroad with your wife and kid...that's not something you forget. Week later I chased him with emails and phone calls, but he never responded and ducked my calls. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed with the recruitment process. Expect a certain level of professionalism from FB, but the truth is sadly different.

Phone call screening by HR and followed up by call with line manager. The call was fine but wasn't too sure what they were looking for and it was quite distracting to see the person on the other side of the video chat doing something else on their screen rather than listening to you speaking.

It is a very straight-forward process with 5 different interviews with several internal stakeholders. HR is very friendly and will be of help during this process. There is an additional background check that is done after offer is accepted, so you should tell the truth about your employment history. You can get a bit anxious while waiting for a feedback after every interview, the best is to wait or send…  an e-mail to HR in case you want to know about the outcome.

2013I have been contacted by the HR and they set up a phone call. I've got eliminated at the 3rd round.1st Round: The phone interview: (The HR interview was typical phone screening)Talk about your history?Why Facebook?Why should we hire you?Give us a couple of success story examples for your account management skills?2nd Round: (Next week) Interview with the hiring manager: (The questions were more job and position specific)Your major clients?The…  volume of the revenues that you are currently managing?What do you do at your current position?How can you contribute to this position at Facebook?3rd Round: (Next week) Face to Face Interview with the regional head. (This is where I failed. I guess I got pretty excited and my mind went black. :) It was hilarious. )How do you manage your clients?How do you manage your team?What is your go to market strategy?

Fast and efficient communication, seamless travel planning, different questions from different team members - each focuses on a different angle. Had 2 phone interviews and 4 onsite + a sales presentation, based on a case study.

I applied on Facebook Jobs and within a few days got an email to set up a date for a phone call interview. The call was set and it took less than 30 minutes. It was very generic, asking to detail my recent position and what it detailed - responsibilities, analytical skills and how these were applied on a daily basis and so forth.

The interview was a 4 stages. I submitted my resume online.Stage 1: 30 minutes screening call with a recruiterStage 2: 30 minutes call with the hiring managerStage 3: Flown to Dublin, did a full interview day. A presentation and 4 one on one interviews with the team members.Stage 4: 30 minutes call with the regional manager

**************************************IOS Engineer**************************************
Applied online and a recruiter got in touch about a week later. 2 weeks after that was a phone screen with a few easy enough coding questions and some lanuage-specific (Objective-C) questions. About a month later I interviewed on-site at the New York office. The on-site interview consisted of four hour-ish sessions: a design session, two whiteboard coding, and one that was half personality-type questions and half coding (I didn't…  have enough time to finish the coding portion of the last one, but the interviewer told me before we started that I probably wouldn't, so I was grateful for that). Everyone I met was super nice and helpful when I got a bit stuck on things.

I was initially contacted by a Facebook recruiter via Linkedin. She invited me to a Facebook conference in Chicago, however, it was clear that the point of the conference was to interview potential candidates. We scheduled an initial phone call, which she called in to 10 minutes late. We talked about the event, what my career goals are, if I was willing to relocate, and then she eased in 5…  basic iOS questions. I answered enough of the screening questions correctly and we scheduled a 1:1 interview. The recruiter sent me an email full of links to prepare for the interview. She also told me to look on Glassdoor for interview questions. Some of the email links were broken, and only a few of the resources/reviews proved to be very helpful.I attended the conference, which was just a few hours long, and had a 1:1 interview the next day. The interview was scheduled to be only 45 minutes, and we basically went straight into technical questions. There was only time for 2 questions and they involved writing code in a text editor that had code completion, it wasn't Xcode and was a little awkward to use. The questions were somewhat difficult, and would either require memorization of the Foundation framework or you would have had to have implemented that code recently in a real application to answer correctly. After that, there was a whole 3 minutes for any questions that I had before I was hurried off and the next candidate was processed.After the interview, I spoke with the recruiter briefly about how it went, and immediately knew there would be some somber news coming. The recruiter scheduled a follow-up and called me back later the next week (15 minutes late) to give me the feedback from the interviewer. The feedback was not constructive, or helpful in any way. In fact, it didn't seem like any thought was put into it at all. I would even say it was on the border of disrespectful, but you can probably get away with that when you are young, important, and working for Facebook. The feedback could have been "buzz off" and I would have taken it equally as well.

Recruiter contacted me through LinkedIn and asked for a CV. After a week or so, they contacted me back asking to answer general questions (regarding relocation possibilities, etc.) and four technical easy questions: Views: A square subview is centered when viewed in landscape. When the device is rotated to portrait, the square ends up closer to the top-right corner. What's wrong?Memory: What memory management policy do you use for an object's…  delegate? Why?UX: When would you use a home-screen navigation or tab-bar navigation?Understanding of platform: What is toll-free bridging?After that, they've arranged a skype interview with Facebook engineer. The guy was iOS-developer and after briefly asking about my past experience, started with questions like follows:-how will you describe iOS manual memory management for a new developer in few words?-how would you implement call for canceling queued blocks with dispatch_after?-Given a set of 2D points, some integer k, find the k points closest to the origin, (0,0).

Got in touch with a recruiter through a friend, and they passed me along to a mobile recruiter. I had 2 technical phone interviews—one more general CS stuff, and the other specific to iOS. After that, they flew me out to Facebook HQ, where I interviewed with 4 members of the iOS team.

**************************************SWE**************************************
I applied online and heard back a good few weeks later for an interview. The interview was 45 minutes with a fun programming question. I heard back a week or two later with an invitation for u-day in menlo park. In u-day, we started with an interview then had lunch and toured the campus, which is quite nice. I didn't like the particular whiteboard question I was given, but it…  was reasonable. The recruiters and interviewer were friendly and it was all a pleasant experience. My only complaint is that I heard back regarding the offer about 5 weeks after the onsite interview.

The interview was a fun experience - they asked me a lot of technical questions about the programming language that is known as SQL. The second phone interview was able the programming language of my choice, so I choose Java. I had to know about the things known as data structures for the interview and was able to optimize my solution because I'm a boss.

Applied online, heard back within 2 weeks. Got a generic email asking me to fill out a form with further information. Loaded up my resume and filled out the form for all the positions I was interested in. The system really botched my resume and loading up the information automatically. Got an email back with a rejection.

**************************************PhD**************************************
I got the interview through my friend's referral. It took about one day to get the email after he referred me. I was given a list of different groups and asked to choose three of them. The phone interview is almost coding stuff. The interviewer was an Indian with some accent. I couldn't understand him very well and I asked him to explain a lot. He was nice and gave…  some hints when I was stuck. The interview lasted for 45min including 2 coding questions. On the same day, I received the email that they decided not to move forward with my interview.

The interviewer called me rather than skype as the HR told me, the phone signal was not good, and he had to move to another place to call me again. This is my first coding interview, so I was not quite used to it. I was running out of time to write a good code, and I feel it is hard to evaluate the coding ability of a student in…  a limited time.

**************************************Administrative Assistant**************************************
Starts off with a phone screen with a recruiter, then you start interviewing with the team, sometimes more than 1 team. Interviews last about 3.5 hours on site. You first meet with a team of admins who decide if you can even come back for more interviews. The people that work there are great and you can tell they love their jobs. Unfortunately, the interview process is lengthy and you…  don't get any updates along the way.

After passing my phone interview with the recruiter, I went in for my second interview with 3 of the staff. I was given the names of all three interviewers and expected to see them all at my interview. Apparently something had come up and one interviewer was replaced with someone that wasn't originally indicated in my email. The first two interviews went really well and was very comfortable. It was…  a nice easy conversation interview where they asked me situational questions and I replied with my job experience or what I would do in such a situation. Both interviewers seemed quite satisfied with my answers and kept praising me at how well I answered the questions. It wasn't until the last interviewer came in that completely changed the mood of the interview. First off, she was late. Second, she didn't introduce her self and just slammed all her personal belongings on the conference room table. Third, she barked instructions at me like rapid gun fire and when I asked her to repeat her question, she looked at me like I was inferior to her. While I worked on the task she gave me, she paid no attention to my work and stared at her phone. When she believed too much time had passed, she said, "Okay, do you have any questions for me?" It was then that I decided to ask her how she came to Facebook, how she balanced her personal/work life, and if there was anything she could tell me about the position. She looked as if she didn't have the time of day to spend some time to get to know me or how I worked.The whole experience was lovely over all, seeing the nice people, even through the hustle bustle of FACEBOOK. That last interviewer really caught me off guard and quite possibly could have been the reason I didn't get offered to come back for a final interview. My recruiter said that he'd keep me in the system and contact me if anything came up that I would qualify for. He stated that because I didn't have as much experience working with engineers that it could have hurt my chances. Unfortunately, they didn't feel like I had the capacity to work with engineers and learn.

I emailed my resume to a Facebook employee who then forwarded my resume to a recruiter. I received an email from Marc in less than 2 days. Marc is a recruiter for admin jobs at FB. He is very professional, kind, very helpful and he was such a pleasure to speak with. We set up a telephone interview in less than a week. Telephone interview was great. Just going over…  your background, skills and a few typical interview questions. After going over resume/skills etc. I was then told he was going to forward my resume as well as his notes to a hiring manager. Then they go through all the applicants and then decide from there. I was a little nervous so I don't think I did as well. Probably why he suggested I start as a contract worker and eventually converting. (LOL) Anyway, I love that he was straight forward and to the point. Marc explained there were typically 2 rounds of interviews after the phone interview. Sometimes just 1 but it all depends on the team. After the phone interview a hiring manger will contact me for a 2nd interview within a week or two and then see if I go on to the next round where I have an interview with at least two team members. I had a great experience. Even if I don't get another interview, Marc was awesome and glad I was able to connect with him.

Applied online in August 2013 through FB. I finally received an email in January, after an FB employee referral, from a recruiter. We scheduled a phone screen for the following week. I was a bit nervous as this was my first phone interview for a job I really wanted, and I'm sure she could tell. I have over 15 years of Administrative Assistant experience as well as a wide variety…  of other skills that would be extremely useful to FB. It would have been nice if the recruiter too a bit more time to get personal instead of straight to the point.

I saw the job online and I applied for it immediately. Within 2-3 2 days I received a call from Marc, the recruiter. He was very nice and professional. Asked me questions about my work experience and background. Said that he was drawn to my resume based on my length of service with my employer and achievements. He explained that it was a 3 step process, first with him, then…  the team members, then finally the director that would be supported by the new AA. Marc decided during our call that he wanted to move me to step 2, the interview with the staff. Within a week I was contacted and had a 1:1 interviews with the office manager, and the 2 admin assistants. They were courteous and very professional and asked basic questions. The interview wasn't intimidating or threatening and I was relaxed and comfortable from the start. Beautiful offices with a breathtaking view of the Emerald City! This was probably one of the best interviews I ever had.

A long and detailed process with 9 interviews. A mix of phone and in person interviews. Nice people. Very competitive market. Very nice offices. Handy public transport options. I would recommend people do a lot of research into the company and be prepared to answer behavioral type questions. Be prepared to be interviewed by different stakeholders. Stay genuine and honest.

**************************************Machine Learning**************************************
After an internal referral, a recruiter contacted me to have two phone interviews.The first phone interview went easy with a binary tree path problem and a search problem.The second phone interview was ok with a sorting problem and a random sampling problem.Overall, the questions are easy to medium coding level, but demand a high accuracy and solid background of basic data structure and algorithms.

The interview process was fairly straightforward with a simple coding question. I answered it and showed that the code would work with specific test cases. The interviewer, although a bit rude, seemed to agree on the solution. I wrote the complete code in Java, with appropriate syntax. Its surprising to me that despite answering the question correctly I didn't get to the next round. Its likely that the decision is…  not just a function of my programming skills, but its inexcusable that tech. companies are often disingenuous and non-transparent about the process. It only reflects poorly on the company's culture.

**************************************Network Planner**************************************
It was challenging, but in a fun way. Questions asked required a high level of attention and aptitude. The people I interviewed were very smart and friendly. You get a very good sense of culture and the recruiter gives you a quick campus tour. Overall it was a good experience.

**************************************QA Tester**************************************
Short and succint

**************************************Account Manager OSO**************************************
Applied online, received an email about a week later with instructions to take a 60 minute timed test consisting of 3 questions. Received an email about a week later letting me know they would like to schedule a phone interview. Waiting for them to set the time.

**************************************Summer Internship**************************************
I got contacted by a recruiter after submitting my resume. Then he scheduled me for a phone interview.

Write a program to sum two binary numbers represented as strings.Input: "110", "01101"Output: "10011"

Was asked to solve a question related to Binary Search and variations related to varied datasets. Only one question was asked throughout the interview, and I was asked to code on the white board. No other questions or discussions.After the basic question, the interviewer modified the input data, and asked me questions as to how my code would change.

**************************************Android Developer**************************************
This was online interview. At first interview was scheduled on 00:00 because manager never checked, where I live. After my request it was shifted to 22:30. Unfortunately interviewer could not call me via Skype. He blame that I have outdated Skype version and should check software. This is strange, because as freelancer I use this tool every day and never had problems before.Interview was re-scheduled. Second interviewer could not use…  Skype as well, he told me that I'm offline. Strange, because I wrote him a message via Skype chat :) So we had to use phone and this was not comfortable.Coding assignment was really easy, though interviewer was not able to describe it clear enough from the very beginning.Every candidate could ask question at the end of interview. I wanted to know, if they use reactive approach in developing. Unfortunately my interviewer didn't hear neither about RxJava or about Java 8 streams API at all. You are not obligated to use this in your work, but these are things you could know about from Android Weekly at least :)

1) Phone screen with about 10 multiple choice android questions.2) Phone interview with coder pad. Initial android discussion. Two easy to medium questions algorithm questions.3) Onsite interview. 4 rounds  a) Behavioral interview. Last 30 minutes or so was coding. Combinatoric problem. Not a trivial question, but available on leetcode, hacker rank etc.  b) Android design interview. Design simple app with recyclerview.  c) Lunch - It was amazing. It's good I didn't get the…  job, I would probably gain thirty pounds or so.  d) General Android questions followed by two algorithm coding problems.  e) coding. 2 questions, relatively straight forward. Interviewer cut me off at the end saying we ran out of time.No offer granted I got the kiss of death 9 days after the interview.Phone call with no feedback, encouraged to try reapplying in the future.

I was recruited via LinkedIn, attended a prep session and then met on the phone for my first technical interview. My interviewer called 15 minutes early and skipped the background introductions to ask me about something on my CV from 2012 which he liked. I think it was a rare interview and probably wouldn't happen again to someone else.

I was contacted by a recruiter. Had the standard 8 questions about Android development asked during a Skype call. If you got more than 5 out of 8 right you would move on to the next round. The next round was a call from one of the Android engineers for Instagram. We spoke briefly about our tech backgrounds and then straight to programming. Was told they would reach out shortly…  if I made it to the next round

First step was passing a phone interview. Next, went onsite. Onsite was a visit to see if I wanted to continue forwards with interview process, I declined. It was a nice office but the cost of living to relocate to Meno Park, CA was costly which scared me from continuing forwards.

The first round interview came from an recruiter who works in Facebook, she asked me 8 prepared optional question, which I think list on a paper. 5 correct answers make you pass this round interview. The second round interview is technical phone interview, the process divide into two parts, the first part is about your project experience, a coding test in the second part. Question is not difficult, but require…  bug-free and efficient

Passed an initial phone screen where they asked about career trajectory and Activity life cycle. Next phone interview was programming of an algorithm in Java. Did that with one if their Android devs. Interviewer was friendly but did not give hints. Also there was a strict time limit. About 15 min for general questions and 40 for the programming section.

Contacted by recruiter. I've been asked "entry-point" questions like AndroidManifest, layouts as well as activity lifecycle. Some HR questions, nothing special. Once it's passed, you might be contacted/referred to other tech recruiter, so in the process you will talk to 2 or more tech requirers as well as Directory of Engineering. All people are always nice and understand any your situations.Once this is done, first call with engineer will be…  scheduled. I've been told should expect 1-2 calls where you answer on questions, then written questions about algorithms. I've passed first call and been invited on site interview.All flights, times, taxi, food and any other expenses covered by Facebook. All people are welcomed in HQ as well as helpful. Everybody seems to be very excited and enthusiastic about what they all are doing in the company. On site interview has walk around campus and 4 45 mins + lunch time in campus.You have to have deep understanding about Android platform, have a good experience covering a lot of sides of Android SDK as well as algorithms and their complexity.Very thankful for such a great experience overall.

The recruiter found me on LinkedIn and arrange a Skype call.The recruiter talked about my work experience and asked me 5 simple Android questions and you can move to next stage if you passed 3/5.Then next stage is a phone screen interview with a Facebook engineer.The interviewer is very kind and professional.He asked me about the async jobs usages in Android and discussed very deeply in detail.After that, he gave…  me a coding test.I was not doing well because I can only finish with O(nlogn) time.Finally I only explained the quicker algorithm with pseudo code and interview time was exceeded.

First was remote interview with online coding - write algorithm, in one month later I had onsite interview in London where I had four coding and one android architecture interviews. They give me a chance to see their office and answered on my questions too.

Phone screening first where they asked about 7 questions. After this I had Coding interview which happened through Coderpad platform. It last for 45 mins and I able to solve the problem.

They contacted me via Linkedin. Asked 6 multiple choice questions. You have to answer at least 5 of them correctly to proceed to next step. First interview is conducted via skype but it was just sound, no video so you can cheat.Note: I did not apply for a position in Facebook so I suspected that the person who contacted me was really a FB employee. I found out that ...@fb.com…  mail addresses are valid facebook mail addresses.

They really want you to pass the interview by giving you lots of preparation material. The format of the interviews and the questions were exactly what I prepared for. You can find the coding questions on CareerCup. The architectural question is shown below. I've only got myself to blame for not passing the interview by not performing as I prepared.

I was contacted by Facebook recruiter via email. We schedule Skype meeting and i was ask to answer 8 basic question regarding android APIs (from 4 options i was need to choose correct one). Then we schedule Skype meeting with Facebook engineer. Screening was built from three parts: tell me about yourself and you most complicate task you done in your current job, coding question, and questions to interviewer. Interviewer…  was kind and tried to help as much as he can. I clear this round and now waiting to on site interview.

First the contacted me trough Linkedin and asked me if I was interested. After that I had a short phone interview with the recruitter, in I had to completed a test about Android development.After passing that, I was asked to arrange a phone interview with one of their engineers. I had to code, in an online collaborative editor, an algorithm, in about 30 minutes.

I was emailed by a recruiter who found me on LinkedIn. After some time (due to other reasons) I was scheduled a phone screening at 4AM my local time (In Australia). I answered a series of basic data structure and basic Android questions. Unfortunately, I had some of the exact details (specific names of layouts etc.) and was declined in an email after 3 days.

**************************************Recruiting Manager**************************************
Phone screen, then in person interviews. During the interviews there were multiple hours i was left alone in conference rooms or in the lobby. it felt a bit disorganized.

**************************************Machine Learning Software Engineer**************************************
There was a phone interview with two very weak, very easy technical questions (e.g. basics of binary search). I then went in for a day with two 45-minute interviews, followed by a day with 3 interviews. Due to scheduling constraints, they scheduled next-day interviews (!), but as a result, one of the interviewers didn't show and I had to go find the recruiter, who found me someone else after a…  bit of apology and hassle.The interviews tended to be very similar. First, I'd be asked to talk about some sort of interesting research I did. After that, I'd have one or more algorithm/coding questions, where the first part would be to explain the solution to some algorithmic problem, and the second part would be to code it up. Sometimes one of the parts would be omitted, but every interviewer wanted to see code on the whiteboard.I liked the open feel of the office and culture, but found that people seemed more driven by the company's success and profit than by the fun problems they got to work on, which left me a little less attracted. However, for someone with more interest in business success than I have, that might be ideal. I'm sure there are interesting problems there, and there are plenty of smart people and it's a flexible environment. The vacation time is among the best, though other benefits are still lacking (e.g. investment matching). Compensation included a large proportion of stock grants, the value of which is still uncertain.Due to my timidity, I did not engage in any compensation negotiation, and my recruiter did not bring up the possibility of increasing it, which surprised me given that they knew I had a competing offer. I found that somewhat unwelcoming, but perhaps it's standard.

**************************************Developer Operations, Analyst**************************************
Process took approximately 4 weeks, interview took three stages, one interview each in stage one and two, four interviews at stage three. All staffs are nice and friendly. Sometimes, a bit too nice, which means at the end of the interview, you have absolutely no idea how you performed during the interview. Organization seems to like people from good name schools, lots of fresh graduates.

**************************************Hardware Engineering**************************************
Initially contacted from recruiter within the company, after that I had a phone screening that consisted of some technical questions. Next, it was an on-site interview which consisted of one on one meetings about 45mins each, including a lunch. Most questions were problem solving (regarding HW validation) and some behavioral.I didn't really like some of the people who interviewed me. One was very rude, on his phone the entire time.…  He may have been taking notes but it is polite to state that and make the person interviewing comfortable. This person was also very arrogant and I didn't feel like he was even listening to my responses. Another guy who interviewed me kept asking me about CPU pipeline after I told him I don't know anything about the topic. I'm not sure why he was stuck on it. I told him I have a better understanding of the platform than I do CPU pipeline and drew him a block diagram of an entire system/platform.Only a couple of the folks interviewing me actually seemed like high caliber people. One was from manufacturing (works with ODM/OEM on QA) and the other was the PM (program manager). The rest seemed very junior, including the tech recruiter.I felt like I was at a college campus and I could see how egos could be running wild here, as if it were a popularity contest.

After initial email contact, talked on phone with HR person on detail of the position.Next step was to set aside a 1 hr time slot to do a "hardware design practical" test.Unfortunately, I was not invited to continue with the job application process after the design practical exam.

**************************************Ads Review Agent**************************************
I got a phone call and an email from the recruiting company about this position, and they asked me to interview the following day. I was met with a supervisor who asked me standard interview questions like "Tell me about your education", while we waited for his manager. The manager had more specific questions about my education, skill set etc. and asked some of the "How would you handle..." behavioral…  questions. He then told me to expect a call from the recruiting company later that day.The recruiting company called a few hours later and gave me an offer.

**************************************Graduate Software Engineer**************************************
I applied online at the Graduate software engineer position through the company's website and I got contacted by their in-house recruiter after 10-12 days to arrange a telephone conversation. During the call, I was asked to explain my academic background and what my ideal job description would be. He identified which FB team would be the best match for me and suggested to have a coding interview after some preparation.…  He also sent me material to prepare and told me to contact him to arrange an interview when I feel well-prepared.

**************************************Consultant**************************************
A Facebook recruiter contacted me through LinkedIn to apply for a position. She phoned me a few days later for 30 minute interview. She said whe was going to call again a few days later to talk to a couple of pairs, but she didn't. She did not answer my emails asking for information and finally I received a standard email to tell I was not going further in the…  process.

**************************************Media Ops**************************************
Phone interview with the recruiter, then phone interview with the team member then in person in SF. They moved really fast and I should have taken a step back to make sure I was prepared, but I was so eager to move forward in the process that I think I ended up shooting myself in the foot and I was under-prepared. They asked good questions and both interviewer asked me…  "Why Facebook," so I would make sure you are clear and genuine about why you are choosing this company.

**************************************Market Manager, Community Operations**************************************
The process took around 2 months and a half. With one test, 3 interviews and a final presentation with 3 more interviews on site.Quite a lengthy process and very inefficient in my opinion, a lot of the same questions are asked again and again during the different interviews. Some interviewers are enthusiastic others totally not and I really wonder why they work there...I was constantly given feedback even during the…  interviews except for the final one for no reason. I felt it was just because one person on the team did not like me. I think Facebook is only open when it fits its needs or narrative. So just don't believed the "Open and Connected" thing as I did, even more when you sign an NDA.So basically even if you have the skills set and you did great interviews, if someone in the team does want to work with you for whatever reason, you will not be selected. Maybe it is just part of "Team building" but I just think it is unfair and discriminatory somehow.I'm very discouraged from ever retrying to interview for Facebook.Maybe this was the intent, so that only the most determined would remain. But the impression that Facebook recruiting has made is really messy and frustrating from the managers' part. (HR was always nice and helpful).I clearly advice against applying there if you don't have inside contacts there, unless you just want to waste 3 months of your time doing tests and presentation. Waste of time, I should have rather focused on my interviews at friendlier Tech companies.

**************************************Safety Analyst, Community Operations**************************************
I submitted my resume through their website and got an e-mail from HR a few days later asking to set up some time to talk on the phone. Phone screening was brief. Went into more detail about the position and the process as well as a few basic questions (why do you want to work at facebook? why this position? etc). Then I received an e-mail about setting up a…  time to talk with someone on the team. The interview with a team member was very regimented-as though they were reading a script. Pretty much all behavioral questions. They stuck to the time limit (half hour) very strictly so I felt a bit rushed.

**************************************Advertising**************************************
First interview consisted of a 30 minute conversation with the HR rep to feel out past work experience and future goals. Once you pass that stage, you get another 30-45 minute interview with someone else, where you are clearly on speakerphone. I felt kind of uncomfortable when I realized that other people were probably listening to me. Both phone interviewers were late to call, so build some cushion time in…  when you square away a part of your day to talk to them.Next came the on site interview. There were 4 back to back interviews (took about 2 hours) with members of different kinds of teams. It was a little exhausting to talk to that many people in a row - especially when they're all asking you the same questions. You can also hear other interviews going on at the same time, which made me uncomfortable. 2 of the interviewers were interesting to talk to, the other 2 acted like I was wasting their time from the beginning (came in late, kept looking at the clock, shaking legs, etc).The HR rep was nice enough to call and tell me that I didn't get the job. There are a lot of people involved in the recruiting process (recruiter, coordinator, mysterious 2nd interviewer, 4 1:1 interviewers), which I think makes it a little disorganized. Overall, I wouldn't call the experience good or bad.

First I received a phone call from a recruiter. We went over my resume. I was told I needed to answer questions online (timed). Following that I spoke to a manager. I didn't receive a follow up phone call after that.

**************************************Financial Operations Analyst**************************************
Very quick process. I had 3 sets of interviews within a 2 week period. First was with the recruiter over the phone, than I the second interview was with 3 different people in Finance via video conference, and the last interview was with senior management onsite.

**************************************Product Engineer**************************************
Contacted through LinkedIn. Did two phone interviews.

**************************************Associate SMB**************************************
They start with a interview around 15/20 minutes. The recruiter sent me an email with some questions I could expect. These were the following:1. Improvements you have made to a process or problem in your career to date in order to make an impact, and what that impact was2. An initiative you're most proud of in your career to date, and the result of this?3. Time management/juggling multiple commitments4. Examples…  of working with customers at scale and driving impact at scale5. Examples of delighting a difficult customer/partner they were working with6. Sales acumen – driving revenue at scale, scaling sales activities7. Strategic thinking and collaboration8. How you would communicate with 30,000 SMBs in your region9. How you would segment the client base of 30,000 and what channels of communication would you use for each segment.10. Product knowledge (engagement ads, sponsored stories, page post ads, applications, premium ads etc.) and market knowledge (local competitors & local media agencies, preferred marketing developers (marketing agencies focused on Facebook ads) etc.)11. Driving sales of Facebook advertising products –campaign recommendations for building branding awareness, driving conversions etc.12. How would you pitch Facebook to your biggest client?13. Approach to dealing with client concerns/tricky conversations14. Passion and motivation for working for Facebook15. We live by our company values at Facebook and we actively look to hire people who identify with each of the following:• Move Fast• Be Bold• Focus on Impact• Be Open• Build Social ValueThe interview went well, but unfortunately they chose another applicant who had more sales experience.

This was a rather short process as I was mulling over offers from other companies their size and larger, it took them two weeks to get me from the stage of sending in my resume until my final interview was done. This was a fantastic process, but do to a better competing offer I was forced to cut the process short.

**************************************Software Development Engineer Intern**************************************
I applied online through the jobs portal. The recruiter contacted me in March and she set up a telephonic interview of 45 minutes 2 days later.There was some problem with sound during the interview. The interviewer wasn't audible clearly. So I had to ask him to repeat every 1-2 minutes. But the interview was very cool and he didn't mind that. First he asked me about my projects and then…  he asked me some basic algorithmic questions. I wrote the code for the first question. I misunderstood the second question and only solved it partially.

**************************************Market Researcher**************************************
Lots of interviews with different stakeholders

The first phone interview was pretty straightforward. The recruiter asked some basic interview questions such as Why do you want to work for Facebook? Why do you apply for this position? Tell me about your experiences. What makes you want to pursuit this position as your career? ...etc.The second phone interview was much harder. The recruiter set up an interview for me with a market researcher. She asked questions that…  were more product and company specific.

**************************************Account Manager, SMB**************************************
The interview process was the general standard that I've been used to in the tech industry (phone screens, multiple onsite interviews).In all, I probably spent about 8 hours of my time dedicated to interviewing and screening but ended up receiving a canned email that I did not get the job.I did not feel my time was valued or my candidacy was appreciated or respected. My negative feelings could have quickly…  been avoided with a simple 3 minute phone call.That being said, not sure that I will interview with Facebook again.

**************************************Strategic Partner Development Manager (Media)**************************************
after submitting my application through Linkedin, only after two or three weeks I got a phone call from a recruiter in Singapore. passing the first hurdle, second interview came pretty quick, like 4-5 days after. I got interviewed via video call from a manager in APAC. he was in Bangkok and I was in Jakarta. I was pretty confident with the interview. nevertheless, they never reach back to tell me…  wether the recruitment process continue or not.

**************************************Business Operations**************************************
Had a phone screening (30min) then an onsite interview (3 30-minute interviews face to face). Went over why Facebook, what analytics would I use to measure the performance of the business, my understanding of the role and how Facebook conducts business (works in that space), and lastly an SQL problem. It took 3.5 weeks (after I reached out to HR) for them to give me a rejection. Although I wasn't…  surprised with the result after the wait I think it is unprofessional to not give a status update after making the time to interview in person (seems like this is becoming the norm though)

head office based overseas, so telephone interviews. Hiring manager didnt seem to have read my resume, so was asking questions that were easily accessibale from it. Fustrating!

**************************************Hardware Validation Engineer (Server)**************************************
I applied online through Facebook's careers site, to my surprise I was contacted on my cellphone about an hour after I submitted my application by a Facebook recruiter, he asked me a little bit about my background, about my visa status, and then setup a phone screen for the day after where he told me he was going to make more in depth questions about computer server, this phone called…  lasted less than 10 mins.The next day I've got the call and it was a 30 min interview, I was asked more in depth about my previous experience, and some more questions about servers. At the end of the call he told me that he was going to share his notes with the engineering team and they'll make the decision if they wanted to move forward with me or not, by this time I already knew that this was a long shot, since my background wasn't a right fit for the kind of questions he was asking.Two days after that, I've got the rejection mail thanking me for my time and letting me know that my background doesn't fit that position, which I kind of already knew. The entire process took 4 days, so that was pretty fast, and the recruiter was always professional both on the phone and in email.

**************************************Field Facilities Operations Manager**************************************
Applied online and had recruiter phone screen the following week. Was flown to Menlo Park a month later for six 1:1 interviews with team. Was disappointed by short amount of time I got with each (under a half hour, including with the hiring manager). Most of the employees were friendly although first person I met with couldn't be bothered to get my resume info correct even though she had a…  copy right in front of her. Flight, hotel and taxi all reimbursed. All in all, pretty good experience.

**************************************IT Manager APAC**************************************
Got an email from Facebook Recruiter, to check if I was interested in this position. The recruiter provided a link with the Job Description; which I proceeded to apply for the position.Within 3 days the recruiter set up a screening call - lasted for about 40 minutes. General questions about my current job, my experience and my interest in the Facebook role.Then she set up Video call in about 2…  weeks with the Hiring Manager. The interview was very professional. No difficult questions, just getting to know me and my background. Lasted about 45 minutes.

**************************************Software Engineering (Entry Level)**************************************
There were two parts of the interview, conducted through the college. In the first part, they had some food and gave us the opportunity to get to know the interviewers and ask questions. The second part was a one-on-one technical interview. They asked me to write a program to reverse a linked list on the whiteboard. They also asked me whether I knew the programming language C, and why I…  majored in computer engineering. There likely would have been more programming questions had I been quicker at writing the program to reverse a linked list. I think the next step would be to fly you to Palo Alto for more serious grilling.

**************************************Head of Industry, Marketing Strategy**************************************
HR screening, hiring manager interview, multiple interviews (about 6 or 7) with other stake holders, a presentation in front of 8 or so folks. Everyone I met was great and very engaged. But the decision making took months as there felt like a lot of machination going on.

**************************************Head of Human Resources Business Partners - Latin America**************************************
Very brief, almost inexistent. Recruiter called me on the phone (with a delay of 30min to the scheduled time) , talked a little bit about FB and asked me to talk about myself. My feeling is that she was never listening to me, and did't have the necessary experience to explore my background to the position. In fact, I felt the recruiter was very junior and somewhat cocky. After all…  I asked a little bit about how was like to work at FB and it was over - lasted 15min.I've never heard from the recruiter since then.

**************************************Lead, Sales**************************************
"Speed Dating" style of interviews. Once you get past the initial phone interviews you then move to multiple in person 30 minute discussions with a variety of people/positions. Depending on what position you interview for you will also be asked to present to a team member on a specific topic.

**************************************Personal Assistant**************************************
Very long process to start with after initial application then it was go, go, go!First interview was over the phone with HR, second interview was with another member of staff, third interview face to face with the person I would have been working for. All of these took place one day after each other.After the interviews I heard nothing for a month and kept having to chase HR. I was…  given various excuses as to why they hadn't come back to me. Then I received a call offering me the role but only as month temp assignment until the person who actually got the job could start!They dangled the carrot of potential work after with a new role that was coming up in the future but I felt as though I was being blackmailed. I was told they needed to know I was serious about working at Facebook as they would normally only employ staff from Google or You Tube. Basically I wouldn't be put forward for the other role unless I went and temped there for a month. The HR member of staff seemed surprised that I wouldn't be prepared to leave a full time job for month of temping!Completely unprofessional behaviour.

**************************************Community Manager, SMB**************************************
I had a quick phone screen with the recruiter, about 15 minutes, to briefly discuss: the role, my salary expectations, and how I respond to feedback. After that, I spoke with the hiring manager for about 30 minutes to go over the position in more detail and he asked a few questions about my experience. I was then invited for an interview onsite. It lasted for 2 hours and consisted…  of 4 interviews for 30 minutes each. 3 of them were team members and 1 was a cross-functional team member.

**************************************Software Engineer Vancouver**************************************
I applied by linkedin. After 1 mounth a really an recruiter contact making some questions: Why Facebook? Describe you current position. After recruiter, i was sent to a Software Engineer.During the Technical Interview, while I was thinking and trying to solve the question, the Software Engineer yawned a few times. I found this lack of education and lack of preparation.

**************************************Senior Android Developer**************************************
Facebook recruiter added me from linked in, then called me. After phone review, she arraged an interview with an facebook engineer. 20 of May i had shkpe interview. Interviewer was really polite and warm people. we talked about facebook and give me hints about questions.

**************************************Human Resources Manager**************************************
6 interviews, all in different areas. Quite unique to say the least! The areas were made up on technical skills in HR, communication, culture fit, leadership/management skills and some more.

**************************************Intern - Monthly**************************************
Applied with my resume through university - was invited to a meet & greet, where I could talk to the interviewer whom I would be working with the next week. The interview was held on campus, and I was asked two algorithms and some questions on my prior work experience within the 45 minutes I had. Received a call from my recruiter letting me know I was on to the…  next/final stage of on-site interviewing at the Seattle campus - flew out about 3 weeks later, then had just one 45 min tech interview that asked for one algorithm and some questions about my current job + an info session + a Q&A panel of current employees and lunch on site. Received an email asking to chat after the weekend, then got the offer.

The hiring process was quite simple. They have a very high standard for their interns and make sure that they are treated well throughout the whole process. There were points of waiting and miscommunication but that comes with any company. The interview was not hard and did a good job of explaining the role as well as seeing if I was a good fit for the team.

I'm a PhD student interested in doing a research-oriented internship. Got referred by a Facebook employee whom I met at a research conference. Had two 45-minute coding interviews and one 45-minute team matching interview. The first two coding interviews are standard for all Facebook software engineer interns. The last interview was mainly about assessing my research background, discussing potential projects, and estimating cultural fit. Even though the role is research-oriented,…  Facebook seems to like people who are technical, hands-on, and good at learning new things. Overall, the people I interviewed with were extremely nice and helpful.

One of their University Recruiters found me on LinkedIn and offered a phone interview. It was a standard 45 min technical interview, with a question on merging lists. A few weeks after that, they emailed me to invite me onsite for a University Day, where I had 1 in-person interview.

**************************************Internship**************************************
Applied through on campus career fair. Recruiters were very friendly and met with the candidates the night before the interview to discuss opportunities at Facebook. My interviewer did not provide any hints along the way but showed the final solution to the problem

After being contacted by the recruiter, I had one screen interview at the Boston office. The same week, I was contacted about a second round of interviews, which happened at the Menlo Park office. The second round of interviews consisted of 1 coding interview and a tour of campus.

Contacted by recruiter and had what seemed like a screening interview. That was followed by two technical interviews. All three interviews were over the phone. My technical interviews took place over collabedit.com, which is a google-doc like text editor. My screening interview was a half hour, while my technical interviews were suppose to each be 45 minutes. My second technical interview was exactly that, while my first went longer.

**************************************User Operations Team Lead**************************************
One phone interview with a recruiter, then a second with the hiring manager. Next round i did four additional interviews onsite, and a group interview with the team to be led. The last four interviews were almost entirely made of consulting type questions. Despite the fact that the position would manage 8-12 people, i was never asked about my experience leading teams, or my experience at all really. I was…  disappointed that i didnt have the opportunity to talk more about applicable skills

**************************************Product Marketing**************************************
I had a great interview experience with Facebook. I interviewed with three team members, including the director of the team and my future manager. The interviews typically involved them asking me questions about issues Facebook was facing, then turning my answer into a case around how to improve that. Definitely think about metrics before heading to your interview.

**************************************Data Analyst**************************************
Contacted a colleague who works at Facebook, she gave my resume to HR team. HR called me for first interview over the phone. Had two more phone interviews with hiring managers. Was asked to come in for an in-person interview at NY headquarters, which consisted of 6 different back-to-back interviews. Everyone was nice, personable, and interesting to talk to.

The resume was submitted ny my friend via internal system. After couple months recruiter contacted me with an offer for a junior position. After initial phone screening in 2 weeks I had phone interview. The interviewer was very nice and helping. I did bad, perhaps I was too nervous.

Two phone interview since i am not in the bay area. First one with a data scientist and the second one with the hiring manager. The first one went well and there are a lot of data manipulating and modeling questions. During the second interview, the hiring manager seems impatient and urge to end the interview. The 45 mins interview becomes 25 mins. I feel it is a bit rude…  since the time is scheduled ahead and there is no time left for questions.

I was called in for an interview after a friend that worked there passed along my resume. The interview was extremely casual. I was dressed in black slacks and a blouse, and I felt a little overdressed. 3 people interviewed me, all in Hawaiian shirts. 1 guy told me that he didn't even know he'd be interviewing me, and was unprepared. Another had me follow him to a room that…  was being used for something else. I waited about 30 minutes for the last interviewer, who asked standard "clipboard" interview questions. She told me we only had 5 minutes to ask questions and rushed through my answers. Then she gave me 10 minutes at the end to ask my questions.

Phone interview with HR is the first step in the screening process. HR reps don't know much about the roles other than bullet point requirements. Facebook is still engineering heavy and they seem to prefer that everyone have a CS or similar background which is strange since they don't advertise business development roles as such but stress deep experience with databases and programming during the interview. HR does not seem…  to care if you come from a non-technical background but are perfectly capable of learning new processes and tools on the job. As a new media tech company resorting to initial phone screenings in order to vet candidates is bad form.

Applied online, right on facebook. About a month later, an HR lady contacted me through email to set up a phone screen. I had the phone interview within 3 days. The initial phone screen was quite intense for a call with HR; and I was asked some technical questions. However, she said she was impressed and would pass me along to the next round. I was emailed to schedule a…  next round interview, but was then emailed a canned rejection email. I thought it might be a mistake, so I followed-up, but didn't get any response.

I was referred by by of the Facebook employees. They first sent me a list of problems that I had to complete by the end of the week. The questions were testing my knowledge of data models and analytics used in Facebook plugins. They asked me about the marketing strategies of the plugin to third party developers and to describe a value proposition. The phone interview consisted of two parts,…  first was a general conversation about my background and then about the company and the job that I was applying for. Then there were two questions, one was a quantitative puzzle and the second was a programming question, I had to login remotely and type in the code to solve a problem, while my interviewer was evaluating it. I did not got an offer in the end.

I started the interview process with Facebook in October 2016 when I was contacted by the recruiter from he company. The recruiter explained about the position, role, expectations and the process in great detail during our first call which went on for around 45 minutes.I had two Telephonic/Skype interviews of 1 hour each. First round was around SQL and second Python.I was communicated the response within 2-3 days and I…  had further call with another recruiter who explained to me the process for Onsite interview. Since I was based out of India and position was in London it took me some time to get the Visa and other formalities completed before going for actual Face to Face onsite interviews.On campus interviews were a bit different and I had 4 interviews in one day. 3 out of 4 rounds were full stack interviews, that is they spanned from data ingestion to data modelling to SQL skills business understanding (metrics) and dashboard reporting. All 3 rounds covered different problems and the last round was a fitment round which was kind of managerial round, and I was asked more scenario based questions to check my work style and attitude. I was communicated the final response again with 3 days, which was pretty fast i would say. Overall I enjoyed the process as it was interesting to have more of discussions with the interviewers rather than the typical question answer based interviews.

One written round and two technical interview.Written round - A lot of questions on SQL and advanced excel; a few aptitude questions.Intermediate knowledge of SQL would suffice.Technical Interviews - Write SQL queries to pull data. Questions on excel and about any tool you have mentioned in our resume. Make sure that you know every single thing you have mentioned on your resume

Recruiter contacted me to know basic of my profile. They shared details with FB hr then my profile short listed and they set up interview round. Before set up interview HR asked me basic technical question on SQL, Excel and Python. I was not able to give correct answer python domain so She shortlisted my profile for SQL and Excel.In telephonic Interview round there was two phase.First Phase was on…  aptitude and general understanding of FB.Second was technical round, It was run for 40-45 min on SQL and Excel.

Test and technical and 2 more rounds.so you have to prepare good in sql and excel...if u have experience you can krack it...2yrs max you can work there on contract.

I was referred by an employee, and the process was extremely fast. They seemed to be in a hurry to fill the position. I had a recruiter phone interview, a team lead phone interview, a data analyst phone interview and onsite interviews.Recruiter interview was as usual very easy with questions on background and knowledge of specific tools (excel, sql, etc).Data analyst phone interview was a bit more technical, with questions…  on SQL and data structure (what is the difference between inner join and outer join, etc).Onsite interview was easy as well, basically testing my knowledge of the internet market and how comfortable I was with numbers and logics applied to the field. Only one interviewer asked unusual questions on excel and seemed unprepared for the interview.

The recruiter reached out to me on linkedin and I had a couple of telephonic interviews. Then I was called onsite. I had 5 interviews onsite with each of them focusing on different aspects of job. Note that facebook cares about cultural fit and if the candidates long term plans match with what facebook has to offer

**************************************Risk and Payments Analyst**************************************
Recruiter contacts you for a phone interview, screening process. They collaborate with someone in the department to determine if they wish to proceed with a second interview. The second interview is either an additional phone interview or an in-person interview.

**************************************Hardware Engineer**************************************
Initial contact on LinkedIn, followed by a couple phone calls. It was a very busy time in my life at the beginning, and they were very accommodating.The culture and environment there is an experience in and of itself. People there are generally very smart, collaborative, and open to ideas.

I was contacted by Facebook recruiter via Linkedin inmail. I replied back and we scheduled a phone call with the recruiter. The recruiter also sent me a link to the job posting she was trying to staff and a few opencompute.org links.Few days later we had the phone call. The recruiter asked me some basic technical questions like: What do you look at PCB design review? What is your experience…  with voltage regulation?... Later in the call the recruiter mentioned she will need my resume and they want me to do Hardware Practical Test. I agreedI took me a few days to get my resume ready during which I was pinged by the recruiter to make sure I am still in business. I thought it is a good sign and that they want to move fast. After few days I sent the resume and we scheduled the Hardware Practical. The format of the Hardware Piratical is that they send it to you over email and you should reply with a solution within an hour. See the exact monostable circuit question below.I fully and timely solved the Hardware Practical. I tested my solution in circuit simulator. I documented my solution. I printed it out and verified that it meets the requirements. After sending the solution I have not heard from them for a week. It was surprising as it is probably a question they have sent out many times so they should be able to check it quickly. It is not like the final go hiring decision. In between the recruiter called me and asked me some more questions , how you troubleshoot a signal integrity issue and what interfaces are you familiar with DDR, PCIe, SATA ect....I always feel awkward when the recruiter is asking me technical questions. Especially open ended ones. Can we really develop technical discussion there or do I need to match some pattern that Facebook Engineer gave to this recruiter?After a week I got an email that I am not a fit. It was surprising as I am very confident about the Hardware Practical solution. She also did not provide any clue as to why I am not a fit, over qualified? Not relevant experience? Hardware Practical? Something else?Overall experience is negative. I would expect Facebook to be more open, professional and prompt in their communication with candidates. Also IMHO making the recruiter ask technical question is not the best idea.

**************************************Research Scientist**************************************
One shared document programming screening interview. On-site day was four rounds: two whiteboard programming rounds which were moderate, one system design round which was hard, one research q&a session along with behavioral questions. Everybody was very friendly and the process was efficient.

Referred by a friend. Start with phone interview, one week later for onsite interview. Overall process went well and company is quite big and culture is nice. Onsite interviews are touch and many design questions related to facebook products. It will be helpful to read facebook engineering blog. I didn't do well in the design question and failed to get an offer.

Standard tech role interview loop. Initial phone screen. Follow up with smaller component of the team informally then invited for a full day interview. Gave presentation of my work, 6 - 8 interviews through the day and received offer within the week.

I was recommended by a Facebook employer. Before attending the on-site interview, I held one short discussion with the recruiter and one phone-interview on the technical details. The on-site interview contains four sessions, two coding, one engineering, and one research. All the interviewers are well prepared, passionate, and welcoming. The whole procedure was highly streamlined and the recruiter was extremely efficient in keeping me in the loop.

Phone interview with the HR about background and expectations on the job. Called in for on-site interview. 1 hour talk on my research topic and 5 back to back interview, lunch with a few team members. Overall experience was positive, some interviewers were more arrogant than others (a Facebook AI guy who dialed in, he was unprepared and asked me questions about my talk which didn't make much sense (probably…  didn't listen to my talk). One interviewer was a core developer (20 something young folk) asked me a coding question trying to make the question harder than it was. Changed the question in the mid-way which made it harder to finish. Behavioral questions followed a simple coding question (which later i found out that the question was wrongly stated).

Recruiter emailed me for a phone screening. After a week, an onsite was scheduled. Went in to meet with the hiring manager who went over the position and the company. He asked me to talk about myself first and then asked a more technical question. He then let me ask a few questions. It went a little bit over half an hour.

The person interviewing me was not in my field. So he didn't undersatand/appreciate my work and area.

**************************************Mobile Developer**************************************
1、fb recruiter find me on LinkedIn, show me what they want and ask for my connection2、a phone call coming for my basic information and several skill questions to confirm they are talking to the right person, And schedule the next phone interview time. It took almost half an hour.3、two weeks later(during the step 2, you'll be ask the time you want to set for the next interview), professional phone interview…  comes.

**************************************Product Design**************************************
First round is a 30 minute phone screening with a design recruiter, and then two back to back 45 min interviews (portfolio review, app critique) with product designers and a product design manager on video conference.

A few phone interviews. First screening and resume review with a recruiter, who then schedules you to have two 1 hour interviews with designers on the team. One was a portfolio review with multiple members and one was a critique of an existing app with one member (if I remember correctly).

Entire process took about 2.5 weeks. Recruiter reached out to me, screening interview for 20-30 minutes. Explained that I have other offer letters expiring soon, Facebook accelerated their the interview process. Following week I had two 45 minute interviews back to back, the first going over a portfolio piece of mine in-depth, and the other critiquing an existing app (Yelp). Overall this interview process was surprisingly fun, and it's clear…  to me that Facebook cares about it's employees.

3 rounds: First round is a culture fit. The next two interviews assess your design thinking. You will do a live critque of a popular, non Facebook owned app. (I did Yelp). The final interview had me going very in depth about the strongest project in my portfolio. These last two interviews each lasted 45 minutes each (The last one went over a bit). Fantastic, friendly people. Ran out of…  spots for interns for the 2015 season, so my application is paused for the 2016 season.

I got phone interview 3 weeks after applying for the job position. The recruiter was friendly but she has lack of knowledge about the job position. It was general phone interview starting from introducing myself and work.

I was contacted by a recruiter and had an initial phone screen. I was told during the phone screen that I was to be moved into the second round. I had 3 weeks to prepare for two back to back phone interviews, one was a portfolio review and one was an app critique. The first interviewer was not friendly and not very responsive to my answers or questions. The second…  interviewer was great and I really enjoyed our conversation. The recruiter kept emailing me saying that they hoped to have an answer early the next week. Over a month went by before they got back to me with an answer.

Recruiter found me at a Facebook-sponsored workshop at my university. We did a brief phone chat, followed by 3 phone interviews -- the first 2 were with product designers, and the last was with a product manager. Everyone was incredibly nice. They were a bit slow to get back to me during the scheduling process, but were very considerate and apologetic.1.) The first interview we talked about my design work.…  It was pretty standard.2.) The second interview was a live critique about an existing app (my interviewer chose Yelp).3.) The last interview, with a design manager, was also about my previous design work, talking through some of the problems that I came up against and how I solved them.All three were very friendly and the tone was conversational and laid back. It seemed like they normally only do 2 interviews (the first and second one), but at the last minute they asked if they could do a third one with me with a design manager. Perhaps the first two interviewers had difficulty deciding whether or not they wanted to hire me?

**************************************Community Operations Team Lead**************************************
PROCESS: I was referred to the role by a friend of mine; the process began through a 30-minute discussion with the recruiter. Several days later, I spoke with the hiring manager over the phone, after which I received positive feedback and an invitation to fly to Austin for final interviews with the team.I had five on-site interviews, all lasting 30 minutes each: a two-person panel discussion, a team lead, the…  hiring manager, a team member, and the outgoing Team Lead I was replacing. The discussions ranged from scenario-based questions to how I would handle team dynamics.OUTCOME: After the discussions, I was notified several days later that I would not be receiving an offer; I requested feedback but wasn't provided any. Fortunately, a good friend of mine at FB knew the hiring manager and provided further details.SUMMARY: The process was smooth and fairly efficient, and while I got a good sense of the culture of the team, office, and company...I didn't sense a real emphasis on getting to know me better as a person. Every other discussion I've had with tech companies for these sorts of team leadership roles places a heavy amount of emphasis on my "fit". Example: I'm interviewing with a particular cloud-storage company (rhymes with Hot Shots :) ) for the exact same role, and during my onsite in ATX they took me out to coffee, asked me what my goals were and what I looked most forward to if I moved there. Less robotic, more holistic.Either way, FB is growing and thriving and brings on some incredibly smart and capable folks. Enjoy the process!

**************************************Quantitative Researcher**************************************
Applied online; 10 days to get back from the recruiter. Screening with HR (ask basic stats questions) then after 10 days 30 min interview with researcher.The interview is a bit a statistics exam, but you do not need coding on formula. My feeling is you need to show you understand basic principles and how to relate them to their business (advertising requires devising metrics, statistical tests & polling)

**************************************Leadership In Product Management**************************************
After the initial screening interview, I went through two interviews - one on vision and the other on metrics. The vision is easy but the metrics one, you have to make sure listing those that they care about.

**************************************Financial Operations: Supplier Master Analyst**************************************
It was a very well coordinated process; recruiters communicated the next steps and what to expect. First I received an email for a phone interview which was scheduled in a week, next day I get an email for the next round - 2 back to back Video Conference interviews 30 mins each, then I was scheduled for a final round at Austin, TX, this was also a 30 min Video…  Conference with the Finance Director, it went well. Unfortunately I wasn't selected. I wish I was! But it certainly was a great experience. :)

**************************************BI Data Engineer**************************************
The interview was a good experience, asked a lot of SQL question and then linked list and so on. The recruiter is really really bad. She didn't inform me anything after a month after the interview, I emailed her 3 times and got no reply. Finally I emailed her boss and she replied like half an hour later.

**************************************Front End Developer**************************************
I received a call from a recruiter who got me in touch with a university recruiter at Facebook. In the first phone screening we spoke about my past projects and then she asked me some technical questions involving JavaScript. I then had to complete a project (~8 hours). After submitting that I got through to another phone screening with an engineer. It was a pleasant conversation, but I fumbled on…  the questions asked.

I applied online for the front end developer position and heard back the next day from a recruiter. We chatted over phone and she was very interested in my skills, so she gave me a coding challenge to complete. I was given an image, and asked to recreate the image in HTML/CSS/javascript with the functionality specified in an accompanying document. I finished it the same day it was given and…  gave them the code. Two days later the developers had reviewed my solution and asked to set up a Skype interview. It was an hour long interview where he asked about my experiences and we coded together online. They were two javascript coding puzzles (not exactly a clear representation of front end development skills). I got both of the puzzles working, but the next day they said they would not be moving forward with me.

**************************************Online Operations Analyst**************************************
It was a pretty standard interview and was conducted via Skype because of weather conditions. Consisted of 2 1:1, 30 min interviews that were all personality-style questions. Be prepared to discuss in detail some of the things on your resume.

**************************************Software Engineer, Intern**************************************
I speak here for the off campus hiring process for students in universities outside of United States. The interview process consists of an offline programming exercise on the website InterviewStreet. The same leads to 2 (or in some cases, upto 3) phone interviews all coordinated by your location's recruiter.The interview process is very flexible and the dates can be easily set up around your schedule. It took me a little…  over a month to go through the entire process although the same could be wrapped up within 2-3 weeks if one desires.

**************************************Field Facilities Operations Supervisor**************************************
I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter on 6/10/14 who asked to set up a phone interview. We spoke for about 30 minutes on 6/13. The recruiter then set up a second phone interview on 6/19, this time with the hiring manager. The recruiter contacted me after and said that the hiring manager told her that the phone interview went really well and that they wanted me to come into…  the office to meet with the team. She also told me that she was no longer recruiting for this division and that another recruiter would be taking over. I was invited to the NY office on 7/1 where I was greeted by an HR employee and put in a video conference room. I spoke with 5 successive Facebook employees, all by video conference with each interview lasting about 30 minutes. I sent a follow up note to the recruiter on 7/2 and received no reply. I sent another note to the recruiter on 7/15 and received a reply on 7/17 stating that she was sorry for the delay on her end and that she would follow up with me shortly, I sent another follow up email on 8/8. She called me a few hours later but I missed the call, she left a voicemail again apologizing for the delay again and asking me to call her back. I called back a few times and left messages on her voicemail. I emailed her the same day asking her to let me know a good time to call. I never received any further correspondence from the recruiter. On 8/14 I sent a message to the hiring manager through Facebook but received no response. The job opening remained on Facebook's career page until around the end of September.

**************************************Facilities**************************************
I was initially interviewed by a Facebook contractor and did ot make pass that point. I was called back because a position opened up. I was interviewed by a Facebook employee at that time. It has been over a month and no response about the position.

**************************************Creative Strategist**************************************
After applying through the website, I was contacted the next day by someone from HR via email. We scheduled a telephone interview for the following week, but having booked the morning off work and waiting for the call I did not hear anything despite emailing them.A week later, I was contacted again by HR, apologetic about not calling due to an illness, and we rescheduled the interview for later that…  week. Again, there was no call when arranged and no answer to follow up emails.The third week came, and we finally managed to organise a call, which did actually occur. The interview went very well, and I was told that my experience and interests align very closely, but they had offered the role to an internal candidate, however there may be the opportunity of an additional role, and they would call back to confirm.I did not expect much and was not disappointed when two weeks past without any follow-up. At this point, I emailed to rescind my interest, which was responded to that the other role is not happening..Not a great experience as a result of a very bad HR rep..

**************************************Junior Level**************************************
It was fine--everyone was friendly. 3 back to back interviews. I liked it. What more to say? It's a great company with great people! It's making me write more words here so I will..

**************************************Client Support**************************************
They took us (the students interviewing) out for drinks the night before. They gave us all good advice. Interviewed the next morning, told the next week that I was not getting an offer.I followed up to ask in what way I could improve, was told that I sounded like my answers were "too prepared", whatever that means.

**************************************Internet Marketing Analyst**************************************
1 interview with recruiter, 1 interview with hiring manager

The process took a total of roughly 5 weeks, and was pretty smooth all around. Initial phone screening, 4-5 in person interviews and a couple other tasks.

I was first contacted by an internal recruiter through LinkedIn. We setup an initial call so I could learn more about the opportunity. After I expressed some interest, they setup three phone interviews with their Growth, Engagement and Mobile team. The first interviewer asked a couple of logic puzzles, case questions on how to grow Facebook and how I would go about executing an A/B test. The second interview was…  a technical interview -- a couple of basic SQL questions. The last interview was a behavioral interview. Afterwards, I received feedback that they would like to invite me for an on-site interview at their HQ. There was some miscommunications with my travel arrangements, but other than some minor snafus, FB took care of everything.At their HQ, I had 6 interviews with various managers and the head of the Growth team. Many of them revolved around how I would grow adoption of various FB products, their userbase, SQL questions, behavioral-type questions and questions about my past projects. It was not a difficult interview process, but I got the sense they were looking for a particular fit -- someone who was passionate about data, marketing, and could communicate big ideas to grow Facebook. They mentioned they were risk averse when hiring candidates -- they'd rather turn down a good candidate over hiring a false positive.The campus was lovely and everybody was very friendly towards me. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and if I have another opportunity to interview there, I may do so in the future.

applied through university job board.First round - in-person interview.1) walked through resume, your best experience/project you are most proud of.2) how could you improve fb's engine so that friend A could find friend B, if friend B were listed as a name other than the one on his birth certificate (and the one that friend A is searching by)Second round - phone interview, 30 mins. 2 stats questions.1) how would…  you increase user engagement for users that have stopped using facebook for X amount of time2) in a game of russian roulette, in which 2 bullets are loaded in a 6-chambered gun, and 1 shot is fired, what is the probabilities of each subsequent shot containing a bullet?

Received a brief screener phone interview from a young female in HR, then she acknowledged that I passed that so she emailed me 4 pre-screen questions and gave me a week to write essay answers to at least 2 of the 4. They were very heady, but really fun stuff-->)1. Pick a product on Facebook. Please describe the logical data model for related fact and dimension tables, the aggregation tables…  you'd want to build for analytics, and the dashboard you'd build to monitor the product.2. Facebook has over 300 million users from around the world and from all demographics. How would you build a model to determine 1yr and lifetime value per user?3. What KPIs would you define to measure the engagement of a cohort of Facebook users? What levers would you build to help improve the KPIs?4. How would you build a state transition model to track the state of a Facebook advertiser?I answered 2 of them and posted my answers on the web.Then I received a call from the Hiring Manager who asked me:1. If I were the CEO of Facebook, who would I say were the competitors...2. What are the odds of rolling a 4 if you have two dice.3. How would you create a model to build a database of all user's possible nicknames4. One more, I forgot...Question 2 I had troubles with, even though I knew that there would be some sort of brain teaser question as part of the interview. I believe that I now know the answer (look at each dice as if it were the same die, not two distinct odds sets e.g. first roll odds 1 out of 6, second dice odds 1 out of 5 (because one side has been subtracted for the first roll). Question 3 the interviewer did not let up on my approach, although I offered several solutions, which he volleyed back at, even though some of his assumptions were specious. I wanted to offer that there were many, many other ways to improve "user experience" that held priority over user's being able to find friends via nicknames, but I did not want to appear to be contrarian. It was apparent by the end of the interview and the competitive nature of the interviewer that I would not be receiving an offer.In conclusion, although the subject matter was highly technical and involved some great problem solving, I did not find the interview process to be all that difficult. However, I found the unforgiving framework to be unrealistic. The reality is that most intelligent people aren't always necessarily quick to the reply (otherwise businesses would increasingly have employees working from home via Twitter 140 character exchanges) and more emphasis should be place on the overall impression from the pre-screen take home questions; work days are no less than 8-hours, not 8-seconds. Although the job description called for my balance between technical, analytical, business and marketing savvy, I ended up feeling that the interviewer wanted another programmer, just like himself.

**************************************Python + SQL Developer**************************************
I have attended the interview at facebook hedarabad location through a consultancy, which is for Python 3+ Exp candidates.First round is a written test which is of 45 mins.very simple questions asked in python..

**************************************UI Engineer**************************************
One of the recruiters reached out to me. We scheduled a call to discuss abt the role. She had few technical screening questions and based on the answers to that questions, the next steps were decided.The questions were basic ones that any UI Engineer should know. I was able to get almost everything correct and we scheduled a phone interview.The phone interview started with the basic introduction followed by coding…  exercise on coderpad.

Quick phone screen with the recruiter that included a few technical questions. Next was a full hour technical phone screen. Onsite was 2 interviews, lunch, and another 2 interviews. 2 technical, 1 personal, 1 architecture. Very very professional.

After basic HR interview asking about background and work experience, I was asked to complete a coding puzzle. They said it took on average 8-10 hours to complete but took closer to 6.5 not including testing. 2nd interview with member of engineering team consisted of 1 UI (html/css/javascript) question, and 1 algorithm puzzle.

**************************************Sr. Software Engineer**************************************
You get initial interview close to where you live, and then they fly you over to Menlo Park. Flying and interview at Menlo Park was a waste of time, since I answered all the questions, but then they said they have too many other good candidates. The place seems dated (old Sun building), not very well designed, filled with people who think they are cool and changing the world, but…  feels more like software sweatshop: open space, peer pressure, overworked staff, crowded. I wonder what will happen to them once they will get out of favor on stock market. They seem to be wasting a lot of money on unrefined processes; the company still feels immature.

**************************************Engineering Manager**************************************
1. Recruiter phone screen. Asked about background, people management, hands-on or not.2. On site preliminary 45 minute interview, very informative. Person described the interview process, how to prepare.3. On site full interview with 7 people. Was asked algorithmic questions, design questions, management style related questions.

Overall the made the process very smooth and clear. It is unfortunate that i did not get it. It started off as the recruiter trying to understand my background and then setting me up 1:1's with different teams to find out where i could fit. Once they identified the team they brought me in for a full interview. I had 6 rounds of interview. It had architecture and design, coding…  , large system scaling, data structures and people mgmt. Having been in scrapy startups i did everything well except people mgmt.

I exchanged a few emails and phone calls with a recruiter and got invited to the campus a couple weeks later.I was told that even managers are asked technical questions (makes sense and I agreed).Did two 1 hour slots (one in person and the other online, separated by a week). A week later I was told that I was not a fit.

Interview process was okay. I applied directly on Facebook's site. Within a few weeks I was contacted via email to speak with a recruiter After speaking with them, I was contacted by the hiring manager for a "exploratory call" - this seemed geared towards making sure I was a personal fit. After a week or so, I was contacted about participating in a technical interview. For this, I didn't know…  what to expect, but I was clearly unprepared. There were questions that were over my head and about topics I had little to no experience in. This was not the fault of FB, they are just on a much different level than I am.

The hiring process was pretty smooth. You operate through a recruiter as your aid on the other side. Mine was friendly and quick to respond to a lot of my questions and kept me up to date with the whole process.The initial process was a brief phone meeting with the recruiter. She asked me a few easy questions which I assume were to check if I was competent and then…  set up a call with an engineer at Facebook. On the phone we talked for a while and he explained the company culture, asked me some softball questions about my resume and then asked technical questions and had me write code in a shared editor from my computer. Your basic CS-200 algorithms questions.A few days later I was invited to the Facebook HQ and met with a half dozen people including my recruiter. She took me to lunch at the cafe and then I went through a number of interviews. Most of which were asking me coding questions to write out on the whiteboard. More CS-200 algorithm style questions. One part of the interview that was fun was more of a architecture question where I designed a system for serving news feed.A couple days later I had an offer over the phone from my recruiter and a full packet came in the mail a few days after that.

**************************************Client Solutions Manager, eComm, German**************************************
Malheureusement je n'ai pas accédé à la dernière phase du recrutement. Je me suis arrêté au 2ème entretien vidéo. Le 1er entretien s'est effectué avec un recruteur et le 2ème entretien s'est fait avec le manager qui cherche un nouveau collaborateur.

**************************************Associate Product Marketing Manager**************************************
I was contacted by a university recruiter who came to my campus. Taken out to dinner to get to know everyone and the other candidates for the position. Interviewed with 2 different recruiters during two different hour-long time frames.

**************************************Network Technician**************************************
Phone interview was set up by another recruiting company. Once the conference call was established they launched right into questioning. It was a very direct, almost brusque experience. Turns out the company and the Facebook staff had miscommunicated on the expectations and skillsets of the employees brought to interview resulting in the job position they were offering being completely different than the one I expected. Needless to say it was…  a very quick interview once this was brought to light.

**************************************Payment Operations**************************************
I went through two phone interviews, brief email interactions, and one on-site interview. The first phone interview was with a recruiter who asked your basic questions about experience, personal values, and corporate expectations. The second interview was with a team member who basically ran through similar questions. The on site interview lasted two hours. Four separate employees interviewed me for thirty minutes each.

**************************************Javascript Developer**************************************
I was contacted via email from a recruiter working for the company. At first I had no interest in accepting any offer since I was very happy where I was, but I decided that a free vacation to California would be fun so I took them up on their offer of an all expenses paid trip to CA.

**************************************Partner Engineer - Facebook@Work - London**************************************
An internal recruiter at Facebook contacted me via LinkedIn about the role. I had several phone conversations with various internal recruiters and whilst these were conversations they should be considered interviews as they asked questions that are usually in an interview setting.After that I had a 1:1 call with the Director of the team and discussed the role and my skills that I can bring to the table, this was…  less technical and more on the market and solution side.The next stage was a technical screen 45 mins with 2 existing Partner Engineers over the phone and on coderpad.io website. I was asked a few technical questions and then given a programming solution to solve. The key is to discuss your thought process and implement a solution quickly, which I did. However the next step is to discuss how you can improve the performance of the solution and I gave a couple of small tweaks that would help but it was not enough and that was me out of the process. I have given the rough question below and the expected solution.If I had passed this stage then the final stage would have been a long interview with multiple people at their offices including lunch etc.Honestly I am not sure I would have taken the role but you had to be in it to have a choice so I was keeping my options open. The reviews here on Glassdoor imply an environment where there is no work/life balance and I got very conflicting answers to the below questions from each of the interviewers:- What percentage of my time will I be coding in this role - varied from 15-20% to 90% depending on who I asked- How many Partner Engineer's does Facebook@Work have in EMEA - varied between none you would be the first to several.These conflicting answers gave me no confidence that I knew the role so if you go for this role try and nail these down.

**************************************Risk**************************************
I was first contacted by a recruiter for a phone screening. She was very nice and informative. At the end of the interview she told me what I should expect and learn about before my next interview with someone on the team. I got asked basic HR questions like "Why Facebook?" "Why this job?" and one specific ? "How can you benefit from fraudulent facebook credits?" (didn't have a great…  answer, but she explained it afterwards) Thought it went great.My next interview didn't go as well. Which wasn't really the interviewer's fault, I just got really nervous and didn't really know what to expect as this was my first real interview, ever. I'd spent so much time learning everything I could about the company, the industry and the work I hadn't thought about questions she might ask about myself, which was what most of the interview was. She asked me why I hadn't pursued something closer to my major. She asked about a time I'd had a disagreement on a team and how I'd handled it. She asked only one question specific to the work at the very end, asking me to get in the mind of a fraudster. Don't get too chatty, because it seemed a little awkward when I tried. And have prepared, general questions for the end if you are totally new/knowledgeable about the work. The questions I asked about her work she seemed confused by.

**************************************Community Operations - Market Specialist**************************************
Simple questions about what I expected from the role, and how I believe I would be a good fit for it. The recruiter seemed unprepared to explain about the role, and didn't set the right expectations for the next interview. Overall it seems like a junior role, where they are looking for someone with senior experience.

**************************************Communications Role**************************************
I was contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn. She thought I'd be a good fit for the role and said they wanted to move quickly and hire someone as soon as possible, so the interviews would happen quite quickly. I had a phone interview with the recruiter which seemed to go well. She then put me forward for a phone interview with a colleague from the hiring team, based in…  the USA. This also seemed to go fine.After that...I never heard anything back. No email, no call, no text, not even a generic "thanks but no thanks" message. I chased the interviewer a couple of times and then gave up. I've heard from a few people that Facebook are like this...all over you one minute, and then never reply to you the next. It's very unprofessional, rude in fact. I understand that they are a very successful business and that many people want to work for them, but manners don't cost much.

**************************************Senior Technical Recruiter**************************************
I was referred to Facebook by two former co-workers. They were prompt and courteous with phone calls and setting up phone interviews. The onsite interview was well planned and well executed. The questions were mainly based on sourcing techniques, and how I found qualified candidates. Office was open and lively; yet could see where it could be somewhat distracting.Facebook has great brand recognition, and a good reputation. I did feel…  like I was interviewing for a den mother role.

**************************************Sales Role**************************************
Submitted my resume through an employee referral.Initial phone screen with recruiter --> video call with Hiring Manager --> in person meeting with team member.Overall a very great interview experience - recruiter was very switched on and provided timely updates and the hiring manager was extremely impressive. Was great to wrap up the process quickly and not drag on as is common with recruiting at most companies.

**************************************Intellectual Property Specialist, User Operations**************************************
I was initially called for a phone interview, which was later followed by a second phone interview, and was eventually flown to Austin to interview in-person on the Facebook campus. During the in-person interview, I spoke to three different people one-on-one, one of whom was the head of the User Operations team.

**************************************Non-tech**************************************
Applied through an employee referral, took about 3 weeks to answer. Phone screening went great. Recruiter was excited to have me on board, and told me I'm on to the next stage. Gave me a date for an in-person interview with a senior hiring manager and said she'll be in touch later with logistics.No word from recruiter for two weeks, stopped answering phone calls and emails. The day before the…  interview said the guy who was supposed to interview me had a change of schedule, and they won't be moving forward with my candidacy. Highly inappropriate handling of the situation. Very disappointing communications. Extremely bad etiquette, since I invested quite a few days in preparing for the interview.I don't know if Facebook reads this, but in case they do, if you made someone prepare for an interview, the very least you could do is offer them another time-slot, even if done remotely.

**************************************Software Development - Infrastructure Team**************************************
I got a call from a recruiter in Dublin, saying that they are hiring 700 engineers for 2012 in their Menlo Park office. I went ahead with it although I wasn't really interested... just to see how this process said to be the best in the world at the current moment goes. I was interviewed by an engineer from FB who asked me only one question: how would I implement…  a cache? I said I was going to use a hashmap, and I started writing how to implement one. I later found out that I should have really spoken about a LRU cache ( you can find the solution about that online). I was disapointed because the interviewer didn't tell me that this is what he was looking for. He just waited both of our times, waiting for me to say whatever I was saying, and in2 days the recruiter said we were not going to move forward, and didn't give me any feedback about the reason. Probably they want people who answer these kind of questions in 5 minutes, otherwise they're not even considering you. They are not flexible at all. I hope other people got a more pleasent experience.

**************************************Client Services**************************************
1 HR screening phone interview followed by another phone interview from team leader or manager. If you successfully go through these 2 phone interview, they will invite you for an on-site interview.

**************************************Executive Assistant**************************************
I applied for the EA position and one of the admin recruiters e-mailed me shortly after to set up a phone interview. The phone interview was pretty basic, she asked me about my experience, my pay and why I wanted work at Facebook etc. She told me that the position I applied for was no longer available and she was going to put my resume in the pipeline for other…  openings. I sent her an e-mail to thank her right after the interview no response, I sent her a follow up e-mail 2 weeks after the phone interview still no word, not even an e-mail saying that "I am not a good fit etc." I have friends who applied for positions and got "no thank you' e-mails from other Facebook recruiting teams. Its very disappointing that the admin recruiting team won't even bother sending you a courtesy e-mail after a phone interview.

Met with the hiring manager(s) during first round. Got invited back for a final round to meet two future peers. The recruiter was amazingly informative throughout the entire process.

The recruiter got back to me with a standard "thank you, but no thank you, please keep in touch" email.

The recruiting team is wonderful and are with you through the whole process. I got to the final round interviews (I had 4) and they decided to go with another candidate because the executive had a better connection with them.

i was contacted by a recruiter, then immediately scheduled to meet with the team. It was a bit unorganized. I was double booked and I didn't get to finish my interview. However, they were very apologetic and told me that they would get back to me to finish up. The questions were all the same, so I felt as if I was repeating myself. The atmosphere was great, and the…  people i met with were very nice.

I applied online directly to Facebook's website and was contacted within a few days by a recruiter. I did an initial phone interview and then I was set up for a face-to0face interview. My interview consisted of 3 back to back meetings with others that work on the team that I would be joining. I was contacted to come back for a second interview whic consisted of meeting with 5…  others in back to back meetings. The reasoning behind so many interviews is that feedback from the interviewers is sent back to headquarters and based on the feedback, the hiring decision is made solely by HR. I enjoyed this type of hiring process because it prevents favoritism. And because everyone works so closely together (no cubicles or offices, everyone works at conference tables equipped with laptops), you really have to have a personlity that meshes well with the group.

Had an initial phone interview followed by two back to back face to face interviews on two more occasions. Facebook obviously want to get the opinion on various people both in the team you'd be working for and from the company at large.

I was interviewed twice on the phone for two roles. No feedback was given and no email to say I was unsuccessful. I have applied to roles since then but no one ever gets back to me. For such a big brand this is a shame.

**************************************Product Design Intern**************************************
I got a call from a recruiter and after talking with her I was recommended for an initial phone screen with a designer. After that, I received feedback from my recruiter and then did a second phone screen with another designer.

**************************************Engineer**************************************
The whole interview process was pretty smooth and the HR people pretty fast in replying to any questions I had. I wont be able to tell the question as such due to the NDA I had to sign, but it pretty much involves checking how you can think on the fly and try to come up with solutions to simple yet interesting problems

Watch out, this company flies you out and takes care of the hotel, but they don't mention ground transportation, and you get stuck with a pretty hefty bill if you don't know your way around.As for the interview, they send a lot of mixed messages - the website states that you should dress business for the interview, but I was dissed by one of the staff for doing exactly that…  (I was overdressed!). In general, I found a lack of mature, objective questions and comments from some of the interview team, who were more interested if I fit in than whether I could do the job. It felt like I was back in high school and I was expected to be cool enough to be allowed into the "A" group.The pay and benefits are good, and I'm sure it's a good place to work if you're good at being part of the "A" group. I think this company needs some maturity and consistency.

The recruiting department is incredibly cool. After the interview the recruiter actually called me to tell me my skills were NOT good enough. This is very unusual in the job hunting world.Also, facebook doesnt really care about a degree if you have experience even if they say they require one.However, without computer science knowledge you will fail the interview.

mail communication at an event for women hiring. The Indian woman interviewer told my company that I have appeared for their interview since she saw many good product related contributions. She rejected me for my past companies and lack of American accent. My manager and the hiring manager then wanted to throw me out of the company and convinced the interviewer to tell the HR that I have revealed confidential…  information to fb during interview. HR asked me to leave the company saying it was an elimination of role and gave me 3 months basic pay, and was telling me about some confidentiality policy.

I was contacted by an employee through LinkedIn, who performed a phone screening before setting me up with a member of their technical team for a technical phone interview. I passed the technical interview and they invited me to interview on site. The interviews were 100% technical and the answers were very challenging.

**************************************Team Lead Sales**************************************
Interviewed with 3 different recruiters and 1 Team Lead for online sales operations out of Palo Alto.

**************************************Android Software Engineer**************************************
I was referred by a friend. I had a first informal chat with a senior engineer on the Menlo Park campus then nothing happened for a couple of months until I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter that organized a phone screen.The first question was "tell me about an Android API you have worked with". A very open question where I talked about the MediaCodec APIs and tried to explain…  how Android sometimes releases APIs in their early stage without all the details being polished. In that case, the lack of asynchronous APIs and undocumented hardware behaviour. But also that having the source code helps a lot and that the Android team is really quick to update the APIs too. I'm pretty sure the interviewer did not know the MediaCodec API and did not really understand what I said. It was a one way conversation. In retrospect, I wish I had just talked about the View APIs or something more famous.Then the interviewer asked 2 coding questions on coderpad. Although I had the overall general idea, I made some mistakes which explains why I didn't get an offer. The interviewer will not tell you if the answer is correct or not so you have to be relatively confident. Don't do like me and be sure to be pretty comfortable with the leetcode/codefight stuff.

A recruiter at Facebook saw my LinkedIn profile and contacted me by e-mail. We arranged to talk on the phone the next day.I thought we were simply going to discuss my background and interests (which we did) for her to pass on to hiring managers for consideration. However, I wasn't prepared for her to pull up a technical quiz, which she conducted over the phone. She read out 8 multiple…  choice questions on Android and recorded my responses. These were not problem solving questions, but static detail knowledge about Android that I would normally look up instead of knowing off the top of my head. I only got 4 of 8 correct, and it wasn't enough to move forward. She said if I had advanced to the technical interview, it would have included similar questions but in greater depth.

1. Applied on facebook site2. Contacted by email from a recruiter3. Skype screening with the recruiter (about myself, past experiences, ...)4. Skype technical interview with the recruiter (10 close answer questions about Android), required 8/10 to pass next step5. Skype code interview with a Facebook engineer at Menlo Park (questions about android and an algorithm code exercise)6. A second Skype code interview with a different Facebook engineer at Menlo Park…  (questions about android and an algorithm code exercise)

Worst interview experience I have ever had. The technical interviewers were great, but the technical recruiters are 1) extremely rude 2) unorganized and 3) lazy. After my first phone screen, the technical recruiter contacted me 1 month later, and let me know that they would like another phone screen two weeks later. Then after the second phone screen it was not until 3 weeks later where they let me know…  I was not a good fit.

The process was basically Skype interview. At first interviewer introduced, then I introduced myself. Then it followed by few theoretical questions. Then was coding question related to merging 2 arrays.

The interview was hold by recruiter, Skype voice only. First explained the hiring process, time schedule and the visa, and than asked a few simple questions about Android development, provided four answers let you choice, you must did most of them corrects. After that the recruiter asked something about my work experiences and relative backgrounds, my current product/App, my team

**************************************Manager, Data Warehouse Operations**************************************
Recruiter contacted me via LinkedIn. He was super nice when we spoke on the phone during initial technical screening. The questions ranged from MySQL, Hadoop, Operating Systems and networking. After that, he set a coding interview with someone from the team. I was asked to solve a program via scripting. With little struggle (I haven't been a hardcore programmer), I was able to get it done. Next came, a talk…  with hiring manager. This was another round of hardcore technical screening. We spoke a lot about MySQL and Hadoop infrastructure. I did alright in that, so I was asked for an onsite interview for 4 hours. I met with Director level employee, hiring manager, folks reporting into this position as well as a peer. The questions were related to their operational problems and best way of doing things at facebook scale. Since I have not operated at facebook scale, I just put forward solutions from my viewpoint. That was not good enough for them, so they decided to pass me. Recruiter called me couple of days later with specific feedback which I think is pretty cool. I didn't expect the recruiter to be so thorough in the feedback. In addition, recruiter helped me in every step of the way, so kudos to him. On the other hand, I felt hiring manager didn't know how to interview (he hardly looked at me in 45 minutes I was with him and he apologized for that during the meeting itself).

**************************************Market Specialist**************************************
The whole process took for a month in which I first had a written exam and then attended 8 interviews: 3 phone calls and 5 video conference interviews. The first interview was with my recruiter and then I had interviews with the team members and managers. Everyone I've interviewed was friendly and they made me feel really comfortable. A week later than my last interview I've received an offer letter.

Applied long time ago. Then got a random email from a recruiter. Almost skipped the email.Then asked to write a short paragraph of the language you applied. Then got a phone call with the recruiter talking abt the cv and the related job roles.After that, got an email said to have a chance VC with one of the team memebers and recruiter attached a set of stuff that “help” you…  to prepare. However, nothing related to the set was asked. I prepared 2 days read so much stuff abt fb.And almost at the end of the vc with the team memeber i discovered the job role described by the recruiter was actually not too correct compare to the team memeber said. Which means all the previous answered were so WRONG.And as expected, rejection email received.

I was contacted by an HR officer from Facebook. She saw my LinkedIn profile and offered me to start the interview process. In March I had a first phone screening, then in May I had to write a 300 word essay answering: "If you could change one thing (in the world or) in Facebook, what would it be AND what would you do?". After that, I had a first interview…  in June with someone from the team. That was 30 minutes. Two days after I had three interviews in a row, 30 minutes each, with the team leader and two other people from the team.

Initial round with online test for 600-800 words essay in 30 mins. Then, moved to HR screening phone interview. Both were quite easy and helped me to understand what the job might be. After that, had 40 min long video conference call with one of the team members. Questions were quite straight forward, but her attitude was not welcoming. I knew that she's not gonna put me in the next…  round at the very first second of the video interview. She made an unpleasant face immediately after she saw me on the screen. (Like I look that bad?) The 40 min call was basically torture for both of us. She mechanically asked me questions related to the job, and it didn't seem that she paid attention on my answers. I have a MSc and some research experience at the LSE, but her final question was "Have I dream about living in Europe?"I just hope that she doesn't behave like that to other interviewees.

First was exam in your language you're applying. Then HR interview via phone.Make sure you have good signal connection so you will be able to hear cleay. Or if you can ask to conduct it over Skype, much better.

1. Contacted by Recruiter2. Handed in C.V.3. Short (200-400 words) text exercise to determine language skills in native language (German)3. Phone interview (30 min) with recruiter4. Phone interview with market specialistThat was my last stage, I didn't pass it. I was not provided with a feedback. As the interview was rather "informal" in terms of questions like "why do you want to work for facebook?" I don't really know why…  I didnt make it to the next round. What I heard is that the next round would have been the last one.

**************************************Ads Analyst**************************************
I first got a phone call where they vetted me over the phone. That went well, so they brought me in for an in-person interview. I signed an NDA, so I can't go into too much detail. I will say that they keep you on your toes throughout the process, so keep your thinking cap on.

**************************************Facebook Ad Analyst**************************************
Was referred by a friend and spoke to the recruiter about the position. Had a phone interview with a team member which went well and then in-person interviews on campus. Overall great experience but they were looking for someone with more knowledge on Facebook Ads.

**************************************Software Development Engineer**************************************
Phone interview and code pad onlineEngineer will call you and you will be asked to write code on coderpad.Dont need to run the test, just explain and test it.No behavior question straight forward coding question

It was a Skype interview with a Facebook engineer. He spoke to the point and interview was for 45 mins. 5 minutes went for intro and question/doubts. The problems given to me were not that hard.. Cracking the coding interview prep is a must!! Also, glassdoor questions too helped..

After speaking to a recruiter they provided a website of unlimited practice problems. This was really fun and helpful. I had one technical phone interview and thought it went fine but I didn't get asked back.

I have a contact in FB. Applied and they asked some basic interview questions with phone and codepad.io. Didn't do well altgough got the first 2 questions right since I'm too slow. Questions are very basic.

one phone interview over the phone, the interviewer talks nice but not helpful. even some times i asked some questions he is not likely to respond. it will let you to introduce yourself at beginning, and get to know some about your project experience. little java basic questions then jump onto the coding questions.

I got two phone screens. Then Facebook flew me in from Europe for onsite interviews: 1 design interview, 1 "culture fit" interview, and 4 coding/datastructures. I did well to pretty much of all them except one coding. After about two weeks, the recruiter contacted me to tell me that they weren't able to take a decision, so I got an extra phone interview with a "very senior" guy a few…  days afterwards.It was an enjoyable experience for most of it. The most important problem was one interviewer who was obviously not ready to give interviews: he was totally unable to explain the problem I was supposed to solve and was interrupting me every minute.

2 phone interviews Got a phone interview with FB through a recruiter . first 15 minutes are pretty standard background questions like what challenges or what you learned through previous projects and experience. Then followed by two coding questions:

Mostly the regular algorithm problem, like binary tree, linked list and string manipulations. A couple of them are related with real products of Facebook. One interviewer is particularly interested with the experience of distributed system.

Just ask Two questionsUse write board or paper to write down the code

- received offer to interview in email- had a phone screen with recruiter- had a phone screen with questions from a software engineer. The engineer was very difficult to understand. I asked him to pick up the handset and he said that he was unable to.First question: for a random-ordered bucket of numbers 1 through 3000 with one number missing, how would you detect which number is missing?

**************************************Community Operations Specialist**************************************
Two phone interviews, four in-person interviews, followed by one more phone interview. Overall, they were extremely quick in getting back to me, which I appreciated. The recruiter was responsive and helpful.

I applied through the careers webpage and was contacted shortly thereafter to complete a timed writing sample. A few days later, I received and email from my recruiter and we scheduled a time to speak over the phone for a screen. After the phone call, he asked me to send over my availability for the coming week, and he explained that I would be advancing in the interview process and…  speaking with someone on the team. Long story short, I never heard from him again... the scheduling email and all other follow-up emails went unanswered.The process was, overall, very unprofessional. I completely understand a recruiter's busy schedule, but this seemed to me to be a complete disregard for an applicant's time and energy.

**************************************Developer Support Engineer**************************************
I received a message from a recruiter at Facebook asking to schedule some time to talk over the phone. During the phone call, he went over the job description. He then asked me some multiple choice questions. The questions were mostly front-end based questions. 400 error, meta tags etc. He also asked some simple OOP questions. After I passed that portion, he sent me a simple Fizz-buzz question. He had…  to run my solution through a developer and once they approved it, we scheduled an over the phone technical interview.The over the phone interview wasn't. the developer talked with me about the job and day-to-day duties. We went over 2 coding questions. The first one took me a little bit longer than I would have liked to solve. The second question wasn't to bad as I have seen that question before. It didn't take me to long to finish that. I didn't get the good feeling that the developer liked my solutions even after I talked him through it. It just sucks that they expect everyone to code at the same speed (fast). Rather than basing it off of personality and thought process.It's been about 3 days now and I still haven't heard back from them, which I expected. If I do hear back, I will update the post.

Got a call through a recruiter. First level technical screen was done by the recruiter. After I cleared this test, the next was a phone screen with an engineer in the team. The whole process was very professional and smooth.The phone screen had 2 coding questions that I had to solve in 1 hour. They were easy. Read leetcode if you want to crack facebook interviews. I solved both the…  problems, but my code missed edge cases. I think they want people who can get it right perfectly in the first go(which is kind of expected ). My bad luck.

I was originally approached by a recruiter by the name of Turner via Linked In. He was very courteous, explained the position to me in full detail and asked me if I was interested. I told him I was, and was scheduled for a phone/collabedit interview. I thought it went really well and later heard back from Turner saying they wanted to fly me in for a second interview. Travel…  plans were made with ease and I headed down to San Fran for an interview and made a long weekend out of it. The Facebook campus was absolutely beautiful and the culture there just seems amazing. I met with three different people there and ended with a presentation. It was about a 4-5 hour process. In the end, my nerves took over in the technical portion of the interview taking me longer than expected to answer the questions. I attribute that to why I was not offered the position but will soon know more when Turner debriefs me. I may have not been a right fit for this position but hope to apply to more in the near future. Everyone at Facebook was extremely nice, the interviews were comfortable and I can only wish that I can work there some day.

First off, after submitting an application for the job, I chose from a set of three options to do a programming test. I didn't finish the problem (it was a hard one to get my head around), but I think I was on the right track. I didn't hear back for a couple weeks or so after first applying, so I assumed my answer was deemed insufficient.Much to my surprise,…  I received an email from one of the recruiters, wanting to set up an initial screening interview. After the phone screen with the recruiter, I also had an interview with one of the members of the team I was applying to, which primarily consisted of doing two programming problems. Both problems were pretty simple and I must have done well, as they asked me to come out for an on-site interview. Thus I crammed myself into a seat on the airplane and flew out for the interview.All in all I had three "formal" interviews during the day, plus a more informal lunch and tour. The first interview pretty much was to gauge my ability as a programmer, to see if I knew what I was talking about. I believe I did pretty good here, although I completely blanked when trying to answer a question regarding RESTful services. It's something I could have figured out pretty quickly looking at code, but not something I was going to answer very well there, as I am somewhat ignorant when it comes to some of the terminology.The second interview was more of a test of my problem solving skills. I think I did pretty well here as well, although it a bit difficult, as I was expecting a bit more guidance and feedback from the interviewer as I was going through the problem.The third interview was with the team's supervisor, and I believe this was to get a feel for what kind of employee I would be, and if I would be a good fit for the team. I think I rambled on for far too long about my job history, and the interviewer was unable to get to everything they wanted to in the short amount of time we had.The lunch was delicious and the tour was interesting. I enjoyed the chat during the lunch and tour with the employee who accompanied me, and I think I came off pretty well.After lunch, I had to give a presentation to what the rest of the team that I would hopefully be joining. I believe I did a decent job with the presentation, considering limitations I had encountered due to some technical issues I had. The group in the presentation had a couple questions, then left. I was then quickly shuttled out of the building by one of the recruiters. I got the feeling that the interviews hadn't gone as well as I had thought they were going, and that I would not be joining the team. Granted, that may just have been my sometimes pessimistic nature.

I applied for this position in New York City. After having scheduled a phone interview, I was informed that the New York City position had been cancelled and the only one available was in Menlo Park, CA. The interviewer was extremely pleasant and fair. They outlined the position and responsibilities, and what a Developer Support Engineer's role would be in the company. Unfortunately given the new location of the job…  I had to decline.

I applied job online via Facebook career and after two weeks, received the email for phone interview from Facebook headquarter. The interviewer is very helpful and friendly. First, They asked about general interview questions such as why Facebook and what's your aspiration. Then I was asked the multiple choices question on web technologies and programming knowledge.

Got a call through a recruiter. First level technical screen was done by the recruiter. The next was a phone screen with an engineer in the team. The phone screen had 2 coding questions. None of the questions were difficult. The interviewer also asked general questions such as why Facebook.

After online application I was contacted by HR via email. After that was phone screening for about 30 minutes with about 10 simple questions (HTTP, HTML, CSS, basic PHP). I answered for all questions correctly and I had big experience in support role and PHP-coder, interviewer said to me that within couple days she will proceed my application to the next steps. But then she dissapeared for weeks, I reminded…  her once week about me and finally after 3-4 weeks I received feedback that they decided to not proceed further with me.

one phone interview and one skype interview with online coding on a whiteboard

**************************************Web Developer**************************************
Applied online at their career page, submitted resume online. Was contact a few days later by a recruiting agent.Following day, was given an programming challenge, which is to basically build a single page webapp. After I submitted, waited for a few days, got an rejection email which says that they didn't find a good fit for me.

**************************************Media Solutions Intern**************************************
Total of 3 rounds.Round 1: Phone interview with recruiter, all behavioral questions.Round 2: Phone interview with someone in the department, all behavorial questions.Round 3: On-site interview with 3 people. 1) Facebook specific questions such as "what do you think about this particular product/feature?" 2) All behavioral questions. 3) Skills test, was given 3 stats-like problems to solve.

**************************************Community Organizer**************************************
It was very structured with a FB recruiter and it first involved phone interviews then onto VC interviews. The VC interviews showcased an actual person on the team and your hiring manager. I think its most important to hit it well with your hiring manager because they are the ones who will be your boss. Overall they have a fair system where each interviewer goes and does an objective rating…  on how the interview went I believe.

**************************************Specialist, Community Operations**************************************
From the time I received my first email after applying online to receiving a phone interview it took a total of three weeks. The first email i received also contained a link to a 30 minute timed writing sample which contained two questions. After I completed that I didn't get a response back until two weeks later when I sent another follow up email.

**************************************Backend Engineer**************************************
I solved the puzzle online then got a call from recruiter, she set me up for technical interview. On technical interview data structure questions were asked. Such as reversing linkedlist and reverse printing linked list in different ways. The interviewer was yawning though. But I liked the overall attitude of the recruiter. I hope to work there but couldn't get the offer.

**************************************UX Designer**************************************
There are 3 sessions. The first one is a phone interview with the recruiter. Then about a couple of weeks later, there are 2 following sessions with designers to talk about your past work and discuss a problem together.

**************************************Non-Technical Role**************************************
A brief call with a recruiter, followed by a 20-minute virtual interview with a young-ish potential supervisor. The interview started late and seemed harried, with only an instant to quickly make an impression and establish rapport. (Speed dating.)Also, the title and role changed a few times during the interview process, which made it hard to adequately prepare. It seemed that they were struggling to identify what they wanted and who…  they were looking for. One tip I would give future interviewees: be prepared to guide and direct the conversation. If your interviewer is rushed or unprepared, be ready to take control and ask the questions that place you in the best light.I would add that if you are coming from an unconventional background, as I was, you will have to help Facebook understand what you bring to the table. I asked about this early in the process, and it was dismissed as "not an issue, we like your application very much." But in the interview, there were questions like: "so what do you do, again?"In retrospect -- and this is not at all meant to be negative, because I think Facebook is a great company and I was flattered to be considered -- I sensed that I might not have enjoyed working for this particular group, since they weren't as sure of what they wanted. Which can translate into day-to-day frustrations on the job.If I could offer one constructive suggestion: read the applications and ask one question specific to the applicant, versus three generic questions that tend to produce canned responses.

**************************************Strategic Partner Development**************************************
I was not looking for a job but was approached by a current employee that suggested I might be the right fit for this position on this particular team and was encouraged to submit my resume. After my resume was submitted no less than 5 minutes later I got an email saying I was not the type of candidate they were looking for to fill this position. I suppose at…  least they followed up!

**************************************SRE**************************************
Contacted by recruiter on linkedin. Initial phone call with him and than technical interview over the phone with engineer. Engineer asked about my experience and about knowledge of linux systems.

**************************************Software Developer Intenship**************************************
I have 2 phone interviews. One was with the HR asking about my personal and my goal for the future. The second phone interview with the software guy, he asked lot of questions about technical skill and you have to code online so he can see it.

**************************************Data Science**************************************
Applied through on campus career fair. Got interview in a week. Invited to a reception before the interview in their office. Interview process is very straightforward. Interviewer was nice. Talked about my projects on resume a little bit and why I like to work at facebook. Standard SQL questions.

Recruiter reached out to me via Linkedin. We talked about the role and I mentioned that I might be fit for similar role but not this one. She agreed to my proposal and we decided that she will connect me with the other recruiter. Never heard back, even after repeated follow-up. I am ok with no, but not responding is pretty disrespectful.

I submitted my resume at a career fair, they contacted me a few weeks later to have an on-campus interview. I passed the first 45-minute interview and then was called back for a second the next day. Since we had such a short amount of time the interviews were fast-paced, but pretty straightforward.

First phone screen, pretty easy algorithmic problems (shuffle an array), complexity analysis on the response. Second phone interview: algorithmic problems again, a little more difficult than the first.Third interview: conversation with one of the datascientists about basic statistical modelling techniques

**************************************Privacy Program Manager**************************************
Very courteous HR and HM interview. Everything was conducted very smoothly. I'd applied online and an in-house recruiter got back to me in a week. After a very quick initial screen (very basic explanation of my experience, probably to see if it made sense for me to apply for the role), interview with the hiring manager was set up in a week. As expected, the interview was really tough.

**************************************Triage Specialist**************************************
Recruiter called me to saying I was a good fit according to my resume. Asked if I wanted to be put in the pool of applicants. Got updates from my recruiter throughout the next 1 and half months. Got a 15 minute phone interview with the manager. Then got a video conference interview with 3 different leads at the Facebook Office. Then got offered a job a few days later.

**************************************Product Specialist**************************************
By far the most challenging interview I've ever experienced. Started with an easy phone screen, then a video interview with two current product specialists. Started with behavioral questions, then two case studies.

Others here have had much shorter processes, but mine went like this:1. Employee referral. Recruiter got back to me within a day or two to set up an initial call, which was a few days later.2. Initial phone screen. This was very basic. Simple questions you'd expect at basically any interview, with no skills assessment at all - just behavioral questions. At the end of the interview I'd clearly passed…  because we went ahead and scheduled the second round (I think this is the general "perk" that an internal referral gets you), which was a week and a half later.3. Video conference with a PM and another Product Specialist. Started with a lot of behavioral and why Facebook questions, and then a very short case study exercise. If you brush up on product development, the case study will be a breeze. Obviously I'm under NDA, but at least for my video conference, there were no curveballs. Be prepared to discuss your interaction with other technologies and apps in Facebook-adjacent spaces. Within a few hours of the video conference, the recruiter got back to me and we scheduled the onsite for a week and a half after that.4. Onsite with two Product Specialists and a higher level Manager (above PMs I believe). I had a quick call with the recruiter two days before to talk about logistics and format. Though your recruiter obviously can't tell you much, you should ask as many questions here as possible! The interview was in three distinct parts: the first was about general product and market knowledge, the second was about workflow and problem solving, and the third was behavioral. My best advice is to study the job description line by line. I had no product development experience, but I studied hard for the interview and did well. The interview was tough, though - especially if you don't get a good interviewer, so you're more "on the spot." Have a lot of stories prepared for the behavioral interview, and definitely be sure to ask and think up insightful questions.4.5. Hiring manager phone screen. One of the folks I was supposed to meet with at my onsite wasn't there, so we had a video conference a few days after the onsite. Again, the interview was pretty standard, definitely be prepared to talk about how you fit in with Facebook's mission. The toughie is really the onsite, not this one.5. Reference check. A few days later, the recruiter told me that they would be checking my references and that they planned to make an offer presuming I "passed" the reference check.6. Offer. In my case this was about a week and a half after initial contact about references.

I had previously interviewed for another position at Facebook, and when I was not selected, the recruiter for that position was nice enough to forward my resume to others on her team, hence how I got an interview for the product specialist position. After a very brief phone screen with the recruiter, the next step of the interview process was a video interview with 2 current product specialists.

The entire process took 4 weeks from applying to getting an offer.The initial step was a twenty minute conversation with the recruiter to see if you fit the role. From there a video conference was set up with two prospective teammates. The video interview was roughly 1.5 hours. It was a mixture of your intent to work at Facebook, behavioral questions, case-studies and getting to really know you and how…  well you'd work with others. It felt more conversational.After this round, an onsite interview was scheduled where I went through 3 rounds of individual 1:1 interviews (30-45 minutes each). They asked a lot of case studies after getting to know you a bit. While I can't disclose exact examples, the questions they asked were very much aligned with what the position described (so review the responsibilities and anticipate the kind of issues you'd face in line with Facebook). When you get to this stage, you just have to really use your experience in problem solving to demonstrate how you would get past difficulties and problems that arise. They were all very encouraging so once you get two or three sentences in, the ideas started bouncing off one another.I reviewed Glassdoor over and over again and it was extremely helpful. I'm attributing the feedback given by everyone here to me acquiring the position.

Screened by phone via HR. HR deemed my skillset was good for the job.A week later I was scheduled to interview via video conference with two employees. One of them was a prospective teammate, the other was a prospective manager. The original interview was slated with a person of a different name. This was changed without notice and another employee joined instead. One interviewer attended on time, the other interviewer…  joined ten minutes later.The interview was straight forward. They asked questions revolving around product Q&A and specific cases. The interviewers appeared interested in the answers and typically followed up with questions about my responses. The non-manager seemed to be directing most of the interview.Finally, they began a few behavioral questions. The questions were pretty cliche. For example: "How would your friends describe you?" was a question. To be honest, this question is a waste of time. The interview went downhill from here.At the end I asked questions about the culture. The culture in this specific team seems very straight-out-of-college and campy since it's primarily a operations/support role.At the end, I asked the HR rep if I could send them a thank you note. She said it wasn't allowed.I got an e-mail the next week saying that they would not be moving forward. I replied to see if any feedback had been given and got no reply.Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but it's always nice to have some feedback for self-improvement, particularly if you get past the screening part.

Twenty minute phone interview with the recruiter. Basic questions like "why do you want to work for facebook", and "what's your favorite facebook feature". Next was a one hour video conference interview with product specialists and product managers. Mostly case studies and scenarios. They also asked what product I was most proud to build (quad dome for burning man), challenges I faced at my previous jobs and how I overcame…  them.

I was referred by a former colleague who works here. I went through 5 rounds in this order: HR Screen, Hiring Manager Call, Conference Call/Group Phone Interview, On-Site, Final Call (Hiring Manager). All interviewers were incredibly professional and excited to speak with me. I interviewed with 4 people on-site, each one at a time for a half hour. Interviews were all very thorough and challenging, but conversational and encouraging. There…  were a number of case studies mixed in with behavioural questions.

The process involves a phone screen with a recruiter, a video interview with two Product Specialist employees, and an onsite interview with several more product specialist employees. The process moves very quickly at each step, which is nice so you're not waiting forever to hear back. The interviews are pretty tough, so you should definitely do your homework!

The hiring and interview process went smoothly. I applied online, and I hiring manager got in contact with me via email to set up a phone screening. She asked typical questions about my background and about fb specifically (e.g., what feature did I like the best, favorite mobile app, etc.). She then sent me a challenge to work on and complete within the next week. I passed the challenge, and…  then set up a call with a member of the team. He asked a lot of open ended questions about how you would prioritize issues at work to what is your dream job. They want to see if you are innovative and a big thinker, but that you also have the background to succeed at the position.

Applied to the job through Facebook careers and a recruiter contacted me via email about a week later. I was sent an assignment that I to complete for them to judge whether I was qualified for the job. I was asked to turn it in within the week.I submitted my answer and within 2 hrs the recruiter wanted to setup a screening call. I setup the call 2-3 days later.…  The call went fine, no curve balls, mostly about my background and how I'd used metrics/analytics in the past to make product decisions.He then wanted to setup a call with a team member. I spoke to a manager in the product specialist group about a week later. Again no surprises. Mostly questions about background and how I'd previously done customer development - user-interviews, metrics etc. She had a few questions on how I would decide (using data, feedback etc) to implement a new feature on Facebook.A couple of days later I was contacted by a HR member to schedule an onsite visit with the team. I was told I would meet up to 6 team-members and talk to them for 30 min each. I scheduled the meeting a week later.On the day of the interview I met 4 people not 6. They were all managers in different functions within the product specialist team. Most questions were on my background and some analytical questions. Also standard product management questions - e.g. how I would decide between two features, which one to implement. Most of these questions were Facebook centric, i.e. they picked specific Facebook features as examples.I also spent some time brushing up on my SQL as I figured they would quiz me on that but they didn't. I thought the interviews went pretty well. Nothing I couldn't really answer.I received an email 4 days later saying I didn't receive the offer. Overall the process was very smooth and the HR team was responsive and helpful. The rejection email was a standard one which said I didn't have the right "background". I don't believe that, as my background was more relevant to the job than some of the guys who interviewed me. I suspect some of it had to do with a lack of "cultural fit" as everyone who interviewed me was about younger than me.

The hiring process was a long one, but surprisingly pleasant. I met with some folks early on with ideas of how to use their current data with a few interesting twists. It peaked their interest and many 'informational' interviews later I had two official screening phone calls and then four in person interviews. I taught myself the basics of MySQL before one interview thinking that this was going to be…  a prerequisite. That turned out to be a good move.My advice would be to approach the interview considering real-world problems, a thoughtful launch plan with concrete data to support it as well as risk and mitigation strategies in case it needs fine-tuning from user feedback. Be quantitative but also imaginative. Facebook has some amazing people, so be prepared to go big, or go home.

I applied for a position via their online system. I received an email about one week later from the recruiter requesting to speak with me.The process, from first contact to offer, occurred over 4.5 weeks. I had call with the recruiter first to assess my background and fit for the role. I had calls with the hiring manager and another manager from the group over the following 2 weeks. In…  the third week, I was invited to the campus for 3 hours of interviews (6 people in total). In the final week, I was given and accepted an offer.Everyone exhibited their love for the company and their work. And each person was truly genuine, all of the interviews were actually more like conversations.

I had a screening interview with a recruiter, then a phone interview with someone currently in the position.

1. HR screening call2. Interview with product specialist (regional)2.5 HR confirmation call for the following interview process(I think this stage is similar to 'on-site interview' other candidates from glassdoor mentioned. The following interviews 3-6 were arranged at one time.)3. Interview with product specialist-14. Interview with product specialist-25. Interview with product manager6. Interview with product manager (team lead?)6.5 Reference check and HR pre-offer notice

**************************************Network Infrastructure Engineer**************************************
I was engaged by a recruiter from Facebook in response to my application on the company's web site. It took a while before I got confirmation for an Interview date with the recruiter. The interview with the recruiter went well, however I was not expecting technical questions at this stage but that was not the case because 90% of the questions asked were all technical questions. What I did not…  like was that I expected that technical questions should be asked by technical people since the question format is not based on multiple choice answers. It has been over a month now and I am yet to receive any feedback on my performance even after several emails sent by me.

**************************************Market Specialist, Community Operations - Dublin**************************************
I applied via website and immediately got a reply asking me to do an online test. It was statistical questions and a little essay in the language applied for. It was quite difficult as it had been a while working with this. However I was sent an email that I passed, and had my first HR interview. It was about 20 min on the phone. Asking me about the role…  and my CV. After this I was put through to another phone interview. A lot of questions about how to approach any projects questions. It was not so much about the end result but analysing your thought process. I did not pass this one, but I was told if I did there would have been 3 interviews onsite back to back.

**************************************Software**************************************
I got an interview call after turning in my resume at the college career fair. They usually have two interviews for interns. The 45 minute interview included two coding questions and little discussion about resume.

First 10~ minutes was discussing my resume and background. Got a chance to talk about the work my interviewer did and the work culture at Facebook. Technical question followed, where I went through my thought process and wrote psuedocode. They have an online service where they can see your code live.

On phone interview. Was asked to code live in codepad; no compiler. The question was logical. They are looking for you to address the question carefully, test it on paper, design it well, and focus on the edge cases.If they have to prompt, I suppose its a bad thing because you should be thinking and coding aloud. They want to know HOW you're approaching the problem. The result is not…  that relevant.

Had an on campus interview through the career fair at my school. Heard back the week after and got an interview set up pretty quick. The interviewer was pretty nice and helped guide me when I got stuck. The problems I got were quite difficult and took me a good 3 hours each to solve afterwards. I didn't have any experience with dynamic programming at the time so of course…  I didn't get the correct answer. Better luck next time I guess.

I dropped off my resume at the university career fair, and they contacted me a few days later regarding an on site interview. The overall process was very fast and the recruiters were very nice and helpful regarding questions I had about working at Facebook/the environment there. It was a good experience.

Had a phone interview. The interviewer was not very helpful and seemed impatient. He was also slightly disinterested/unengaged during the interview process. He was late in calling me and would ramble on a bit about irrelevant experiences from the company, leaving me less time to complete my question. Only got to finish one question and didn't work out that well

It is a phone interview, and interviewer first asked me some questions regarding to my resume, and then did a coding problem. The coding question is similar with 3sum on leetcode, but with some additional requirements, like every elements can be picked up for several times, and only need to output one result.

Initially i was phone screened, then I participated in an online video session to help prepare us for the Skype interview, and finally after two weeks I was interviewed via Skype and was asked to talk about my interests and to answer a coding problem.

**************************************Recruiting Coordinator**************************************
I was brought on through a referral and the process was very standard. First, a phone screen with a hiring manager and then an onsite with a few members of the team. They're not trying to trick you with the questions. They just want to find out if you're a fit or not.

Had an initial phone screening and was told that I would hear back in a few days to schedule a video or in person interview for early the following week. After 2 weeks and no answer, I assumed I wasn't fit for the next steps. I then received an email after 2 weeks and responded immediately. Again, no response for 3 days.I called and asked the status and was told…  they were working on scheduling and they would give me plenty of notice. Two days later, I was told I was scheduled for a video interview the following morning. After explaining that due to the short notice, I would not be able to go into work late for a video interview, but would be happy to do another phone interview while on an early lunch break. I was told that there's a lot of other candidates and all will be doing video so if I want to be considered I need to make it work.I made it work and informed them that I will be doing the video interview from my phone. Two minutes into my interview, a call came up on my screen, which I immediately ignored and apologized to the interviewer if there was any information I missed when the call came up. She replied that it was no problem and we happily moved on with the interview for another 28 minutes.Later that night I was told that Facebook passed and my interviewer mentioned that I took a phone call during my interview and that I was obviously distracted and had no prioritization.Overall a lack of professionalism and experience during the whole interview process. I did not feel like I was a priority to them and had any value. Seemed like the mindset was that they are Facebook, and if you really want to work for them you will work around them and their needs. I understand to a point, but there was an apparent feel that candidate experience was not a priority.

First there is a phone screen, 15 minutes.Second, on-site for 30 minutes.Third, four 30 minute interviews.Phone screen and second on-site went wonderfully - I was excited about joining Facebook.Third interview: I arrived, my escort was a bit socially awkward - I had to drive the conversation, which made me uncomfortable. Why send an anti-social person to greet a candidate? Every candidate, no matter how confident or educated, is going to…  be nervous at an interview. I have worked in the tech sector and know how important it is to acknowledge and accept candidate nervousness. First interviewer was great - showed genuine enthusiasm and interpersonal skills. Acknowledged my answers and took extensive notes. My second interviewer was friendly, as well. My third interviewer came in and immediately sent me bad vibes - she was checking her phone while I gave answers, and at one point interrupted me to say, "wait - I'm confused, I thought you said 'ABC' and not 'XYZ'?" I knew after meeting with her, that it would be a "no" vote. I was met with very harsh and judgmental looks. Fourth interviewer was a pleasure to meet. Overall, I walked away hoping I would get hired, since my previous role at a competitor was a lot more challenging than what was presented to me at Facebook.. The questions, however, during the third interview are primarily based on your negative attributes. I literally had a headache once I left, because Facebook's questions really hammered on what is wrong in your professional life - I get it, you're supposed to talk about how you "problem solve," but does every question have to focus on negatives?

I applied via employee referral. I was contacted within 2 days via email and a phone interview was arranged. The phone screen was on time, brief and pleasant, I was invited to come onsite. The onsite was arranged quickly however I did not have the details of who I would be meeting with ahead of time, so I felt this put me behind, I didn't feel prepared. It was a…  struggle to check-in at the desk, apparently, my name wasn't in the system so it took a long time and the receptionist seemed annoyed. They also seemed annoyed when I asked to use the restroom, not a great first impression. The interviews were more questions versus conversations. Have lots of stories to tell, very behavior focused. The interviewees kept their heads down typing notes on their computers.

1- submitted my resume through a friend for a couple different positions2- phone screen with a recruiter3- brought on for onsite. 5 thirty minute interviews.4- offer extended a couple hours after the interview ended.Overall was a quick process. Everyone communicated well; I was impressed.

Stage 1: Phone interview. One of the trickiest first interviews I have ever encountered too date. I spoke with the recruiting lead who was extremely nice and very professional.She knew exactly what type of person/skills she was looking for. A 20 minute conversation turned into a 50 minute conversation.Stage 2: Panel interview in Facebook offices. I met with 3 Recruiters and a hiring manager. They were all very friendly and…  did there best to ensure I was not nervous. It was tough process, however no question proved extremely difficult.It was great to meet with the people and overall the half day spent in Facebook was a very positive experience

Was explained through the phone that the position was a contract position. The interviewer seem dis-interested and it was hard to gauge his evaluation of me. I had to e-mail them a few days after to check-in before they told me I didn't move on to the next round.

Found the position on the site and notified my friend who is currently with the company. She was nice enough to give me a referral. It's good to keep in mind though that a referral at Facebook might get you a phone interview, but from that point forward you get no advantages. The phone interview went well and I was notified within a few days that I would be having…  a Skype interview for the 2nd round. I had the Skype interview less than a week later. I interviewed with four separate interviewers for about a half hour a piece. Everyone was very kind and did their best to make the interview have a comfortable atmosphere. I received the job offer within a few days of the Skype interviews.This company wants passionate people that want to push the product forward, and have ideas on how that can happen. You need to be a problem solver than comes in (regardless of department) and tries to be a dependable member of the team.

Found this position on LInkedIn and was contacted by a recruiter a few days later for an initial phone interview. The phone interview went well and we scheduled a 1:1 on-site interview. The interview was quick and mostly behavioral. My recruiter contacted me within 24 hours to let me know I did not make the cut. Overall, the experience was great and the people were awesome!

**************************************Spam Operations Technician (Contract Position)**************************************
They took about 2 months to setup and have a phone interview. The phone interview was easy. The interviewer was very friendly and encourage asking questions. I was notified that if I pass this stage, I would receive an email within 10 days. I received an email one week later to have an onsite interview at FB HQ. The onsite interview consisted of 2 interview sessions, each time with two…  people. The interview questions were behavioral focused.

**************************************Field Logistics Analyst**************************************
The recruiting process was very clear and concise. The recruiter provided adequate information and suggestions that made me feel confident and prepared for the on-site interviews. The interview did start late, about a half hour. The interview space was very small. Would have preferred a larger space. Each interviewer was prepared and I noticed that there weren't any repetitive subjects or questions. The interview did end on time and overall…  I didn't feel overwhelmed or burned out after 7 interviews in one day.

**************************************Sales**************************************
Ahh, my favorite spying company. They talk big, but deliver like Alex Rodriguez in the 9th for the Yankees. Like A-Rod, this is a much hyped, over exposed company with THE WORST HR department in tech. They are lazy and unorganized. Then if you get to the hiring manager, he will ask you questions that have nothing to do with the job. Not the famous questions Google stopped asking, but…  just random stuff just to fool you. You guys get a “Like” from the Bizzaro World, and that’s not my thumb in the air.

phone interview, it was tough. I don't have anything else to say unfortunately because it was kind of forgettable and clear that neither side felt all that enthused. The interviewer was polite but did not pretend to be interested when she clearly was not.

**************************************Operations Engineer**************************************
I could Barley hear the interviewer.and sadly was asked some basic questions one can easily google and not high level questions expected to be asked as an engineer.I would like to see question like please explain your system at work and let me know what the most important thing to improve in it.

I filed a request in FB carrer page. I had 1 prescreening with someone from HR and 3 technical interviews over the phone.1st interview was about programming. it took about 45 mins, the questions was fairly simple, they just want to make sure you are programmer.2nd interview was about system administration, I can say it was really tough, it's started with some travail questions and ended with tough questions. Even…  though there were some hard questions but they weren't something out of the blue.3rd interview was mostly about networking again there was nothing unanticipated.By that time they asked me to flew to fly to Menlo Park for onsite interviews. they paid for all my expenses and SF is a beautiful city!My interview starts at 12PM, I had 5 interviews onsite.1st interview was mostly about System and Networking, they asked me to explain as much detail as it possible that what does happend when you run "telnet facebook.com 80" in bash. I broke down all the steps and talked about 45 mins about it.We went for lunch2nd interview was about System administration, the guy asked me lots of question that I don't recall, the only unexpected question was what would you do if you had 1000 new servers and want to make them functional, I gave him some ideas though.3rd interview was about programming, again they just want to make sure you know how to program.4th interview, there was a guy from another IT group. His main questions were about the way I communicate to with other groups and how I would solve the problems when there are people from other groups involve.5th interviewer, I suppose he was manager of FB's SRO. He asked me some stuffs that I don't remember exactly but he wanted to know my attitudes and this kind of stuff.FYI if you are worried about the interviews you can freely ask HR about it and they usually tell you what's the interview about and you could preparer for that.

I was contacted by a recruiter because they found my resume on LinkedIn. I had a quick screening phone interview with the recruiter, before having two technical phone interviews, where we shared a collaborative text document so that they could see what I typed. Each of the two interviews lasted about 45-60 minutes. Finally, I had a somewhat shorter (30 minute) management interview.At this point, they decided to fly me…  to Facebook for on-site interviews. I was passed from my recruiter to a coordinator who organized the on-site schedule. I flew down the night before and left the evening afterwards. All meals, transportation and lodging were paid for or expensed to Facebook.The actual on-site interviews were fun. I was given a brief tour by my coordinator, then led into a (very) small conference room with whiteboards. I had four interviews total, with lunch in-between with my coordinator. Each interview was about an hour or so. One was with a manager. One was a coding interview. Two were systems-oriented, since this was an Applications Operations Engineering (aka Site Reliability Engineering, etc.) position.Over the next several days, my coordinator was able to share a bunch of feedback from the interviewers. All four interviewers recommended a hire. I was told that there would be two meetings to make a decision. Once with the AppOps team, and once with some higher-ups for final approval.I was informed that they would keep my resume on file, but that they wouldn't be making me an offer shortly after the designated time for the second meeting. Though the message also stated that my coordinator would like to chat with me to discuss why they came to their decision, to date we've had trouble scheduling a time. Understandably, I suspect I'm less of a priority for the coordinator now that I'm not a candidate.Overall the experience was quite positive and everyone I spoke to was great. Facebook genuinely seems like a great place to work. My only complaints thus far (in chronological order) are:1. My recruiter often took a week or more to respond to my messages. Partially (though by no means entirely) as a result of this, the interview process took several months.2. I found the CS interview questions, especially those on-site, to be disappointingly easy. This may have been due to time constraints, though.3. Because of the lengths of the interviews, I had relatively little time to ask questions of the interviewers. The one exception was my last interview of the day. Because there was nothing but a debrief with my coordinator afterwards, I was able to chat more with the interviewer. This gave me a lot more insight into Facebook, and also resulted in him more strongly recommending a hire.4. To date I haven't been able to pin my coordinator down for why I wasn't offered the position.Overall, if you're given the opportunity to interview with Facebook, go for it. At the very least, the process is a lot of fun. And maybe you'll get a job at a great company!

Got contacted by their recruiter and he asked some basic technical questions. At the end of conversation, he'd like to set up a schedule for a phone interview. One week later, did a phone interview with one of their engineer. After that, no news from FB.

2 weeks after applying online I received a call from one of their recruiters. We had a chat about my current job and discussed some details of the job offer, including my salary expectations.After that we setup a first phone interview with someone from the Palo Alto office. This interview covered Linux, troubleshooting and some networking. This interviewer was very friendly and the interview itself went pretty well.For the second…  one they asked me to go to a document sharing web site and write a script. Unlike the previous one, this interviewer was not friendly at all, he seemed to be doing me a favor by wasting his time interviewing me and was completely quiet during the 30 minutes. I was stuck in one part of the problem and he didn't do anything to help me, like in other interviews I've gone through.I did a third interview which was similar to the first one but more focused on troubleshooting, although we also touched networking and the Linux boot process. Again, this interviewer was nice and friendly.After one week the recruiter came back to me to confirm what I suspected already, we would not proceed further because I didn't do well enough in the scripting part. I'm pretty sure that had the interviewer been more helpful I would have arrived at the solution. The recruited mentioned that I did very well on the other parts and that if I work on my scripting skills for a few months I could re-apply and take it from there.Because of this person I am rating the interview process as neutral and not positive, and will most likely not try again given the constant privacy concerns surrounding this company.The interviewing process is interesting and worth going through, though.

**************************************Marketing Assistant**************************************
Going through the phone interview and in person interviews went very well. The disappointing part was they offered me the contract job but then cancelled the requisition and just distributed the work between the other employees while the employee was on maternity leave.

**************************************Security Engineer, Compliance Analyst**************************************
Contacted by HR about 3 weeks after applying online through their careers site. I had an interview set up with the hiring manager for the security department. HR was very nice and easy to communicate with. 45 minute interview with a few hypothetical situations and how you would respond. Nothing really too bad. Contacted a week later to be flown out to Menlo, Park. Had two 45 interviews back to…  back with another security manager and another with a relatively new person on the same team I'd be working with. The questions weren't too bad if I would have prepared to my best ability. I've yet to work in a security environment which is why I didn't get the offer. Also had a brain teaser on the white board of a scenario. Many of the questions were security compliance related and business scenarios on what I would do. Overall it was the best process I've experienced. HR was extremely nice and always got back to me fast. Team was great and the headquarters was amazing I just didn't get it. I'll definitely apply for full time once I get my security experience.

**************************************Contractor User Operations**************************************
I was contacted to set up two phone interviews on two separate days. The questions were slightly generic questions pertaining to work environment, personality, and past job performances. All in all, my interviews were very relaxed; I talked with two current Facebook employees, not the hiring manager, so don't be alarmed in that sense!

**************************************Mechanical Engineer**************************************
Recruiter reached out to me after reviewing my credentials. Set up schedules to talk with me on the phone as a pre interview. Asked me general questions about what I do.Eventually, was set up with a single phone interview with Jon Ehlen. He didn't ask me too many technical questions, he did most of the talking. I passed this stage and was flown out to Palo Alto for a day…  long face to face. I interviewed with mostly mechanical engineers but had one interview that was totally personality based. Last interview was with the manager.

**************************************Ad Measurement Analyst**************************************
Long, drawn out, and unorganized. Unprofessional HR associate who would not answer emails or phone calls. The entire process took over four months and was a complete waste of time. The reason cited for my not getting an offer was that I didn't have sufficient skill in R, a language that was not once referenced on my resume.

**************************************Accounts Payable Analyst**************************************
Very well organized, checked in and messaged the interviewer. Arrived on time and was called in on time for interview process. Met with the first interviewer that went smooth and then met the second interviewer and was a little more official.

**************************************Solution Engineer**************************************
A friend referred me for the position at Liverail. An internal facebook recruiter reached out and she scheduled a discussion with me.We chatted and she knew very very little about the potential roles and gave information that seemed largely conflicting - so I arranged for an 'informal discussion' with a SE currently at Facebook.This informal discussion turned out to be a phone interview.In the mean time the recruiter had reached…  out to all my colleagues at my current place of work offering them the exact position I was applying for.The facebook recruiter never got back to me with any feedback about the phone screen - even though the recruiter kept chatting with my colleagues.All around a very poor process, and offensive that they didn't even get back with a response, whether it was yes or no. Worse still that they approached all my colleagues.I wouldn't recommend interviewing with Facebook unless you want the same thing to happen with you. Would have expected much better.

**************************************Facebook University for Engineering**************************************
I applied online through the FBU website around late January and got an email requesting an interview in late March. Overall a good experience, but I just lacked interview experience.

**************************************Content**************************************
Pretty straightforward. Applied through Facebook's careers page. Heard back after 1 and a half month or so. Had the interview, then asked for writing samples. Did not get it eventually but it was a fairly straightforward process. Nothing weird in the interview.

**************************************Partner Engineer**************************************
Contacted by recruiter after 3 months of applying online. Had a phone interview with the hiring manager asking about my background and describing the role. Had another programming phone interview focusing on solving a problem on sending large data to customer in minimum latency and handling errors.Recruiter scheduled an onsite interview. Interview consisted of 4 rounds.1) Architecture problem.2) Interview with department head3) Coding exercise4) Team fit5) Hiring manager interview.All in…  all a good experience. Still waiting to hear back.

Phone interview with technical recruiter, went well.

I was contacted by Facebook recruiter who told me that my resume was great and if I was interested on that we could move on in the process. So we scheduled a time to talk about general stuffs, like my academic life, previous works, etc.After that my resume was sent to a manager in US to validated and then they decided to continue with the process.The next step was a…  technical interview on phone screen with a Partner Engineer. He was very good explaining the problem and I could solve it, not with a best solution (I made a n log n algorithm but it could be solved by linear algorithm using hash).So I just received an email telling me that they don't want to continue the process and thanking me.

There are many rounds of coding test, you have to be prepared, some are quite tricky, you might not be able to come up with a neat solution in a given time.Get familiar with the programming language you are good at.You have to give the best answer in every round, otherwise you are done.

I had three interviews but I've heard from them, I need to take 5 interviews.Recruiter was good and friendly. after getting three two interviews as a general interview, I had a technical interview with Chinese guy.But I found the interviewer most extremely uncomfortable throughout the whole interview.All throughout the interview he would continuously yawn and sigh, which I found it to be quite rude and disturbing.He seemed to think like…  he is my boss. And he would often cut me off before I had the chance to reply back fully.We talked about my career for 40 mins then, we got 10mins for technical interviews.In technical question, he just asked one question and I couldn't answer.When he gave hints about the coding and I asked for his clarification,he was getting heated up as if I couldn't understand.And finally, he just ended the interview saying "I don't have a time, thank you for your interview"Wow! how could chinese interviewer act like that? I was shocked.I expected at least for the interview, for both the interviewer and the interviewees to show some respecttowards each other and be well mannered for theirs and company's sakes, but it was very unfortunate that this time, this was not the case.

**************************************Human Resources Specialist**************************************
I received an email from a recruiter letting me know that they had gotten my resume and would like to speak via phone to discuss the opening and get to know me. The phone interview lasted only 15 minutes. The recruiter was a little late calling me for the interview and cut it off right before the end of our scheduled time on the phone. I received an email about…  a week later stating that I was not selected.

**************************************IOS Developer**************************************
Met a recruiter at the Swift Summit in San Francisco. I then had a 45 min phone call with the recruiter and then a 45 min technical phone screen in which I coded on a screen sharing IDE. I did not move on to an on-site interview.

Amazing progress. The recruiters and interviewers were always well prepared and on point. Very personable and made me feel important through the whole process.I was approached by a recruiter and the process from initial reach out to offer was around 1.5 months.

Phone screen followed by interviews. 2 coding interviews, a design interview and a personality interview. Super easy questions, but blew one of them and didn't perfectly handle the rest. aaa aaa

I recently completed a full interview sequence with Facebook and thought it would be useful to recap it all for the next candidates coming down the pipeline.The way your interviewing experience starts is with a technical phone screen which lasts for about an hour. If you pass that you'll be invited out to Menlo Park. My interviewing day started at 9:45 a.m. and officially finished at 2 p.m. (but I…  didn't actually leave until closer to 3 p.m.). The recruiters are very upfront about what happens in the interview -- the initial "jedi" session which is a combination culture-fit and a supposed "easy" coding question, two "ninja" sessions which are in-depth coding / algorithm exercises (which I've recapped below), and one "pirate" session which is an architecture & design session.In terms of difficulty, I felt that the questions were relatively fair. They weren't as relentlessly challenging & tricky as what I've encountered at a traditional Google interview. but none of them were a particularly easy walk through the park. My own personal performance was probably negatively impacted by the stuffiness of the tiny interview room (of course adjusting the thermostat didn't seem to make a difference) and my general nerves (which are always in panic mode every time I'm doing these hard core technical screenings).On the flip side, I was really impressed with the working environment for employees, such as thoughtful touches such as all bathrooms being stocked with thoughtful & useful items (toothbrushes & paste, feminine care items, etc.),The campus is on the shores of San Francisco Bay, so depending on the weather (or the drought) you might be getting a view of water or of a marshy field. I have a feeling that commute times to campus can be frustratingly long, depending on where you live in the Bay Area. If you are able to handle whatever commute you end up having to do, the split campus *IS* a gorgeous and inspiring place. I say "split campus" because there's two different Facebook campuses on both sides of Highway 84. The older campus is on the East side, and the reason it feels like direct copy of the Downtown Disney mall in Anaheim is because it was done that way on purpose. The newer West building is a massive showpiece designed by Frank Gehry, and after my 5 hour interview party was over with, I was able to do a 10-15 minute walk around the beautiful rooftop gardens there with the recruiter.Weirdly enough, aside from a "how do you think you did?" follow-up from one of the recruiters a couple days after the interviewing day, I never heard anything back from anyone. In other words, it's been over a month and I never got the official rejection e-mail or phone call. My guess is the recruiters either lost track of me (which seems strange because they were so on top of arrangements prior to the interview) or they extended offers to one wave of candidates and let other "runner-up" candidates dangle while the first wave made decisions. That was really the only process hiccup along the way.Hopefully my experience flunking the Facebook interview will help you to prepare to pass your interviewing day. If you find any of the information in my interview review helpful, please let me know by voting "Yes" on the "Helpful?" question below (this helps to motivate me to be as detailed as possible).

Similar to some others, I first got a LinkedIn message from a Facebook HR staff based in India. We scheduled the first phone interview, which is a simple quiz with 5 multiple choice questions, conducted by the HR staff. Afterwards, I had the 2nd and 3rd interview with Facebook iOS engineers, different people but the format is pretty much the same. Each is about 45 min to 1 hour, asked…  me to do live coding on coderpad.io. I progressed and Facebook flied me from Sydney to Silicon Valley for a face to face interview. It's from 10am-3pm. Touched on many areas including behavioural questions, iOS app architecture, write code on whiteboard, time and space complexity, etc. I did not get an offer in the end but very impressed by the process.

I was contacted by a recruiter through email, I'm still not sure how he found my info. I had an initial phone screen with him where he asked about my experience and asked me some simple iOS SDK questions. About a week later, I had a technical phone interview with one of their engineers. He asked me more advanced iOS SDK questions. The third interview was on site. It was…  about a 5 hour process and I had 5 different interviews with 7 different people. The engineers were really cool and easy to talk to, but the whole white boarding process is not my favorite.

Initial screening over Skype (5 multiple choice questions) by recruitment officer.Two Skype interviews writing code in Coderpad.Onsite interview constisted of four more sessions, mostly of them writing code on a whiteboard, one "culture fit" and one design interview.Everyone was friendly and knowledgable, the entire process was stress free and actually a bit of fun.I wrote a LOT of code during these interviews, doing two or three exercises per interview. If…  I had to do it over I would code more slowly so as to avoid having to do so many.

Multiple phone reviews. 1). Initial HR with 3 simple ObjC questions. 2). Slightly more in depth discussion of experience. 3). Shared screen coding challenge.

Contacted by recruited and setup an initial phone screening which consisted of resume questions and three multiple choice iOS questions. The next phase was an hour long technical phone interview which can be done in person or over the phone, I chose phone. I enjoyed talking to the FB engineer and thought it was a positive experience even though I did not advance to the third leg of the interview…  process.

It all started with a recruiter contacting me via LinkedIn. We then moved to an initial phone interview (which was also part of the technical screening process!). Another phone interview and then a whole day of interviewing in Menlo Park.The team is very capable and they are doing great things on iOS.Most of the questions are basic data structures and algorithms.

The interview process was kind of long, initial tech screening, online technical interview using coderpad and a couple of Skype calls with engineers. Then finally the onsite interview which consisted of 4 sessions:- Jedi Session - talking about your previous work and where you want to go in the industry/at Facebook.- Pirate Sesion - General application architecture.- 2 X Ninja Sessions - Each session had 2 coding questions in them.All…  in all, a good process if not a little stretched out depending on when they are doing the onsite interviews.

**************************************Insight Analyst**************************************
The first round is telephone interview. It was with the recruiter and she seemed polite. The second round comes days after and it was with the manager. However, the recruiter asked me to wait for 1month for the insight interview. During the waiting time, she replied every 2 mail I sent. I became cautious of the process and sent more emails. I even got a rejection letter after the onsite…  interview confirmation letter (they said it was a system error...so convenient) In the end, she told me the role was taken by an internal person. It was oversight's will and she could do nothing with it.I wasted so much time and energy on this role. And I would like to give others a suggestion: when the HR from FB saying you need to wait 1 month for the onsite, it is a NO.

**************************************Media Solutions**************************************
Got in touch with Facebook recruiter. The recruiter quickly scheduled a phone screening for 30 min, then a week after, another phone interview with one of the team members to talk about my work experience, why Facebook, new Facebook ad products/news, etc. I was invited for an on-site interview where I met with 4 Media Solutions managers (all male, pretty surprising). Each person asked different types of questions (1: general…  work experience, 2: behavioral, 3: case studies, 4: more case studies but heavily stats-based). I was a psych major back in college but have never looked into psych research studies, theories, and more intricate stats-related stuff for 8-9 years. I have work experience in account management and a plenty of research background. I think I nailed the interview but it came across to me that they were looking for someone with more in-depth stats or analytics background. A lot of Media Solutions team members went to ivy league schools and have very diverse work background, not just media/advertising. Would have been awesome if the recruiter gave me some hints what to prepare for, especially on the stats questions. Who knew you needed to brush up on them for this position?

I had an amazing experience working with my recruiter. She was really on top of what the position was and what it meant and clearly communicated a lot of what Facebook stood for. She was quick to set up follow-ups and interviews, and was on top of making sure everything was set up correctly. I didn't get the job, but overall I didn't experience any negative things that other reviewers…  have.

First recruiter contact was by e-mail asking if interested, then appointed a Skype interview with basic questions, just to check if knowledge meets the job description. Second phone interview, in portuguese, with local office media solutions manager, more technical questions and business scenarios to bring solutions. Third interview, in Facebook office in Sao Paulo, 5 different people during whole morning, technical and business questions.

**************************************Client Solution Analyst**************************************
covering most of the behavior questions, it's not very hard if you have thought through.also including the analytical think part.i think the most important thing that this company looking for is thinking capability.learning capability is a must, otherwise you will be very painful.

**************************************Online Marketing Specialist - SMB's**************************************
1. Phone interview with recruiter -- some in depth questions but nothing I wasn't prepared for. (Looking at glassdoor really helped with this one.) The recruiter was very helpful but towards the end she sounded like a robot repeating her thank you phrase... Also reminded me of flight attendents that rush through their sentences with the most monotone voice ever. She told me right off the bat that she wanted…  me to speak with the hiring managers after our interview. She didn't want to give any names out of the hiring managers. They're very secretive about that but she let me in on his first name, which I actually found on LinkedIn. She emailed me the details for my next phone interview which was the next day. She gave me a bunch of links to be familiar with and to help me study. I spent all my time studying and focusing on the FB ad products, none of which made it to the next round interview chat.2. Phone interview with hiring manager- went awfully (in my opinion) as I blanked on the first question he asked me. (Math question.. see below) I know I could do it but put on the spot on the phone was just too uncomfortable for me and my nerves got the best of me. He sounded so pretentious but started to warm up a bit. He even held my hand through out the math problem that i epic-ly failed. After the first question I bombed, I really wanted to hang up or tell him he didn't have to waste his time anymore on me haha. Anyway I tried my best to revive myself from his unexpected questions. It was definitely nothing the recruiter prepped me for, but then again she was just trying to help. Anyway after 20 minutes he said "Oh wow it's already been 20 minutes? I have a meeting in 10 minutes. Do you have any questions for me?" He didn't even allow me to talk about myself or give me the stand to give my background.. i guess that's what the 1st interview was for.. but i just felt i had a lot more to offer based on my experience and i was really bummed that he didn't give me a chance to do that. What's worse, our convo was cut short so I couldn't ask him all the challenging questions I wanted to. I even asked if I could give a suggestion for FB improvements but he said, "that's a great idea and thanks for suggesting that but to be completely transparent so many people have suggested that to me but i do appreciate you taking the time to think of that." What a great way to end the interview! :D There you have it-- FB people will be totally transparent with you on whether or not they want to follow up. So even though I have not yet received a rejection email, it is pretty apparent that the offer does not stand.

**************************************Community Operations Analyst**************************************
I applied online and received an invitation to take an online test around a week after applying. Analytical test consisted of 8 questions mainly including graphs and interpretation of data and some problem questions. Language test consisted of 2 questions. First question was a short article in English and you have to select the correct answer based on your understanding. Second questions was in a language I was applying for…  and you should write a short text of up to 400 words.Make sure you use ALL symbols available in your language like appropriate alphabet, accents and signs like à, è, ù, ç because if you do not the system will recognize it as a mistake and your results could be below their expectations. Unfortunately, that was the reason I did not pass the test. :(

**************************************Revenue Forecasting Analyst**************************************
The recruiter contacted me based on an application I had submitted about a year ago for a different role. I then had a 30 minute phone call with a recruiter and 30 minute technical phone call with the hiring manager.

**************************************Software Engineer Co-Op**************************************
Some questions about projects were asked, and online coding was required. Only technical interview through skype, if you want, a HR interview is available. The engineer would give you some hints if you didn't have any solution.

**************************************IT**************************************
Typical IT leadership questions; not a bad interview process at all. However, I was startled by the final question (which broke me, I think...) How would you make the company proud of IT? Since i had never thought of that, my response was pretty weak...

**************************************Software Engineering Manager**************************************
Was introduced to Facebook by one of the recruiters approaching on LinkedIn. 45 to 60 minutes on site screening interview with one person after one on phone screening and before full panel of one day of interviews. The room allocated for interview was so small that if both people stand up and talk, they are literally in each other's face.

**************************************SMB Org**************************************
Was submitted as a referral for a position, but I also applied for another position on my own. I assumed I was being contacted for the referral position, but actually it was the one I had applied to (ooops). I had gone through two rounds before we figured that out. Somehow made it to the third round anyway. (Recruiter Screen, Hiring Manager, Person I'd have been working with closely- all…  phone). The people I met with were great, but my experience overall was not.I had another job offer that came in during the process, and I told Facebook this (and initially they worked with me on it), but after the 2nd round interview they just fell off the face of the planet. I tried e-mailing them to see if I could get some feedback or a sense of whether or not I was moving forward, and I got no reply. The other company had a second choice candidate they were about to lose, and so I decided to turn them down so they didn't lose that candidate. (They had waited long enough for me).Then like two weeks later FB gets back to me and acts as though I had never sent any email about the job offer, and schedules a third round. It wasn't a great interview (as in, I wasn't great. The person I met with was lovely). I didn't hear back, and after like a week I e-mailed the recruiter to ask if they needed anything else from me. Nothing. It's pretty clear I didn't get the job, but it would've been nice if three rounds had earned me at least an email reply.I've never understood those people who talked about recruiting horror stories, but I guess now I do. Don't get me wrong- Facebook is fantastic, and the people from the org I met with were great. But it definitely wasn't a very respectful recruiting process. So while I'd still love to work at FB, I'm in no hurry to go through that process again.

**************************************Marketing Strategy**************************************
Referred by a friend who works there. I had two HR screening calls, followed by a face to face meeting with hiring manager. Then followed by three additional interviews and a presentation

**************************************Account Manager (SMB)**************************************
For the SMB team in Dublin. I had an initial screening call with FB HR, then a phone interview with a senior manager and the final round was an onsite in Dublin with three 30m face-to-face interviews followed by a presentation to a panel of the three interviewers. Quite efficient process, overall taking 4 weeks. I was impressed with the amount of information they provided, the tell you what they…  look for, key facts, links to key products, videos about FB & Dublin and finally they even provide a list interview prep questions!Unfortunately I was unsuccessful with the only feedback as "we didn't see how you engage with clients" which from talking to others who were unsuccessful they also were told. I think this translates to cultural fit, but the lack of real feedback is the poorest part of the process. Overall, very good though.

**************************************Software Engineer--Intern**************************************
University Career Fair

**************************************Software Engineering**************************************
The interview went pretty well. There was a small discussion on my college projects which lasted only around 5 minutes. Then, I was asked to open the codepad link and asked to write the code on wildcard pattern recognition and dry run it. I wrote it, explained but was not able to handle a corner case. I was expecting second round since the interview was not that bad but was…  rejected on the same day.

Had an on campus interview- was 45 minutes. Asked to code a question on whiteboard. Passed, and was flown out to Menlo Park for a full day tour of the site, and had another 45-minute interview on whiteboard, with a project team lead.

Applied through campus fair, got an email about a week later for an on campus interview. Recruiter was helpful in answering questions, and got to meet the engineers the day before the actual interview to ask them questions about Facebook and such. Got back to me about a week after the interview for setting up the on-campus interview.

Applied through campus career fair. Waited for a week for response. Rescheduled on-campus interview to a phone interview. The questions are generic: introduce yourself, tell me a bit about the projects you have worked on, algorithm questions, do you have any questions for me?

Process was fairly uneventful. Applied online, met with recruiter, then I got an email back about two months later.Interview was decent. Interviewer seemed robotic and that I was just another number to them. He did not answer my specific questions, but rather answered with canned responses.For a company that is supposed to be so highly desired, I didn't feel like they cared about me as an interviewee, which directly translates…  to how they would have treated me as an intern. Really disappointed in this company.

The intern process wasn't too bad. It was two technical phone interviews (the second only if you do well on the first). The recruiters and interviewers were very nice throughout the process and help you along the way, and are also very accommodating to other offers/deadlines. The second interview was significantly harder than the first interview, so just be ready for that.

I applied online and heard back from a recruiter. Arranged 1 phone interview with an engineer. There are 2 technical phone interviews around 45 minutes for the intern position.

It was just the most basic software engineering interview. Easy question, then harder question that you had to whiteboard out, then any opportunities to ask them questions. All in all the most vanilla interview I've ever had.

I was referred to Facebook by a former intern and the recruiter reached out to me at the beginning of September. After a few email exchanges, we scheduled a Skype interview. The interviewer asked me a technical question and after I finished it, he told me to optimize it. I optimized it but I think I took too much time since this was my first technical interview ever.

I did a 45 minute technical phone interview, and heard back a few days later that I would't be moving forward in the recruiting process.During the interview the recruiter seemed to really want me to use an advanced data structure such as a graph or tree to solve the problem, and I tried to play along. I eventually just tried for an iterative solution but didn't have enough time to…  finish.

I applied online and gave my resume to a recruiter at a career fair recruiting event on campus. I was contacted a few weeks later via e-mail and scheduled an interview for another couple weeks out. Interview was over phone while on online coding platform. Interviewer was nice, and didn't ask about projects or resume, but jumped right into coding questions.

First interviewer was nice second one was kind of condescending. The second interviewer was from the people engineering team (basically HR). I didn't get the offer although I got both questions right. The second interviewer said "I think we have good results" giving me false hopes. I guess my though process was not good enough for them. Facebook's becoming more mechanic when doing interviews. I am sure they get tons…  of applicants. Recruiter followed back with an obvious template that said "thanks for visiting us" although I only had phone interviews...

I applied through university recruiting as well as a referral, and then was contacted to conduct a 45 minute technical interview. The interview was contacted on coderpad in conjunction with a phone call

Got an interview through a connection. It was one of my first interviews, and overall was a very standard experience (after working through some other interviews, I got the feel for it). After some basic fit questions, I got two technical interview questions, and the interviewer was somewhat helpful in working me through the problems.

I was able to start the interview process through an intern referral. First, my university recruiter contacted me for more information about myself, then 2 weeks later we scheduled the first technical interview. This interview was via phone and coderpad, and less than 3 hours after the interview the recruiter got back to me. The onsite interview was scheduled for later that month, and it was a 45 min technical…  interview followed by a day filled with tours.

Facebook has to be the worst company to interview for in the Bay Area when it comes to engineering. Facebook likes to hire engineers almost exclusively from two demographics (White & Asian) and that's it. If you don't belong, then do yourself a favor and do not waste time interviewing with them : Facebook won't hire you. Not only that, engineers conducting the interview will put you under more scrutiny…  than they would other candidates. You will be at a disadvantage from the first question. Simply, they are not used to hiring engineers from your background and they will set you up to fail the interview, a self fulfilling prophecy.My advice to Facebook is, in general, train well your engineers in regards to unconscious bias and have them certify before allowing them to conduct interviews. In particular, I would add to no let engineers on sponsored visas that have been in the country for only a short time conduct interviews to citizens and permanent (green card) residents as they do not understand yet the race dynamics of the U.S.A. It just does not feel right. It would be fine to let them conduct interviews for other candidates looking for visa sponsorship though.

I applied for and android position. The overall process was really quick, 1 month aprox. The recruiter touched base over Linkedin and after a week I had the phone interview. Here I was asked a medium difficulty coding question (See bellow). After a week I was told they wanted to take me into On-Site interviews. Over there, in San Francisco, I was received by the recruiter and he took me…  to the interview room. I had 4 interviews, 3 coding + 1 system design. After a week they told me I wasnt selected. Honestly, I dont know what they focus on when interviewing, cause I got the solution for all the coding questions, just struggled a little bit in the design one, and nevertheless, I didnt get an offer.

Resume drop at career fair, followed by an on-campus interview followed by invitation to on-site. The on-campus interview was mostly technical and involved writing code on whiteboard. The question was adequately challenging but not impossible.

1 Campus interview, 1 Onsite. Really nice and professional people.You should be very comfortable with coding on a white board and algorithm complexity.Both of my interviewers were foreign and so there was an accent issue but they were really understanding and happy to repeat themselves.

Applied online, asked for a friend's reference and then got a 45-minute on-campus interview. They informed me that I passed the second day, and then invited me for onsite interview.

Spoke with someone over the phone while I solved coding problems through a website. Was called for an on-site interview and asked to solve problems on a board. Interviewer spent some time on his phone while I did that (was a bit distracting).

I had a friend of mine refer my resume to the recruiter at which point I received an email, asking to schedule a technical interview. I had a phone call with an engineer and was given a problem over the phone to implement.

General discussion on resume and previous professional experience and resume projects. I was given preference between Java and Python for coding.One coding question. It was supposed to be completed in 30 mins. Asked me to dry run the code and find bugs myself. Also was asked for the complexity of my code.

I applied online in October 2015, after that in December I received an email from recruiter asking for preferred date and time to schedule first technical phone interview, for which I appeared in January.            In the interview I was asked couple of Algorithm questions, to which I took lot of time which lasted entire interview. Interviewer was really nice and provided me with some useful hints to reach optimal solution. At…  the end I managed to solve the questions but didn't get callback for second round. In the interview I asked for feedback to which interviewer responded saying the questions which were asked to me were not that difficult and shouldn't have taken this much time and also I wasn't accurate with coding (I did fumble with the code initially). In my opinion I didn't to too well in reaching optimal solution, I sorta stumbled upon the solution.           The recruiter was really nice and prompt in responding to emails throughout the process, and interviewer was a really helpful.

It was super fast and amazing process. The recruiter first arranged a phone screen and then another on-campus interview at Menlo Park headquarter. Both of the interviews were to the point and the interviewers were super friendly and really wanted to know how I was thinking through the question.

The usual tech interview. I applied online and got contacted by a recruiter who was nice. I was asked a behavioral question and then a technical one. It was my worst interview experience but that had nothing to do with the interviewer or Facebook. Looking back now, the questions were easy. I was in the middle of taking my first CS class when I interviewed there so I didn't find…  it as easy. But anyone with good CS background should be fine

Process took 3+ weeks. 2 phone interviews. The first was mostly about my experience and projects I've worked on. The second was about data structures and algorithms - they had me use a Google Docs to write code. Interviewers was very friendly and helpful.

After sending in my resume, I was contacted by a recruiter and after about two weeks had a 45-minute phone interview. The interviewer was a software engineer at Facebook, and he asked me to answer questions on coderpad.io. We spoke at the beginning for a few minutes about our backgrounds, coded for around half an hour, and then chatted at the end; I asked a question or two. All in…  all, it was very pleasant, and they let me know within 24 hours.

I had an on-campus interview and had to answer 2 questions in 45 minutes. The second problem was much shorter than the first one. I spent about 35 minutes on the first, and 10 minutes on the second.

The process was very nice. I met with an engineer at my school's career fair and handed them my resume. After two days, I got an email from a recruiter telling me that they wanted to set me up with an interview on my campus. They also invited me to a dinner with the other students that they got in touch with, which was nice. The interview at my school…  was a 45-minute interview where they asked me one technical question. It went well and the interviewer was very nice.After that interview, I heard back within two days that they wanted to move forward. I was then able to schedule an interview on-site at their office in Menlo Park. When it was time, they flew me out to Menlo Park for Facebook University Day. I had one 45-minute interview in the morning, followed by a full day of getting to see what Facebook had to offer, including a tour of the office.The on-site interview was the final stage of the process for interns. They sent me their final decision within a week.

Attended a campus career fair and networking event. They got back to me and invited me to an on-campus interview a few days later. Was told I made it to the onsite 3 days later. Flew out to Menlo Park 2 weeks later, had 1 technical interview followed by a tour and some presentations. Recruiters were all very friendly and helpful, great experience.

The interview was about 45 minutes. It was on-campus. I was asked to write code on the whiteboard. The one who interviewed me was a infrastructure engineer from FB. The interview was one to one. The whole interview was a positive experience, even though I did not get a offer.

I applied online and was given a call within a week. We scheduled the interview, and it was a technical question. i'm still under nda so i can't reveal specifics. Definitely brush up on cracking the coding interview problems. The first couple chapters of problems (5th ed) are relevant.

Apply online, get contacted, complete a phone screen, a phone interview, and an on-site whiteboard interview. You must pass each round separately, but the final round I was flown out and got to experience interviewing on their campus and learn what their engineering life was like.

I dropped my resume at a career fair. Recruiter contacted me and we had a meeting where we had a chance to chat with our interviewers. Then I had an on-site interview with assigned interviewer (engineer). Interviewer and recruiter were nice and the whole process was smooth.

I had one phone interview, and within a day after that my recruiter emailed me for a second phone interview, which she told me meant that I did okay but not great enough to get to the onsite immediately. I then had the second interview and thought I did horribly, but was invited to the onsite the next week. They only gave me one technical question in each round but…  in the first round after I had solved the first question, they gave me the same problem but with the constraint that I couldn't use a hashmap. Efficient process and quick response time from the recruiter, only complaints are that one phone interviewer had a very heavy accent and it made it very difficult to understand his feedback.

Interviewed at college campus career fair, then a week later got called onsite for an interview (I chose the Seattle office for the interview), and the next day got the offer. Both of the interviews were 1:1 with an engineer (first with a SWE, second with a manager) and they were both technical, but they asked a few questions about interests and what I wanted to work on at Facebook.

On campus recruiting, followed by an onsite. The interview questions were generally pretty easy, and the interviewers generally were good with hints on how to optimize code. The process was extremely straightforward. Make sure you put code down on the whiteboard that is clean and readable.

I'd applied through facebook website university recruiting. I got an email from their recruiter within 2 days and I set up the telephone interview in two weeks. The interview was supposed to be a technical interview in collabedit. The interview started of with basic behavioral questions. What is the most exciting thing you have done till now? My speaking skills are very sub par, so I fumbled a lot while…  answering behavioral questions. Then I was asked to suggest an Algorithm to print the nodes of a binary tree in their vertical order.That is the a                                                  / \                                                  b c                                                  / \                                                  d e                                                  / \                                                  f gThen output isb f a d c g eI solved the question without much of the interviewer's help in under 5 minutes. Then I was asked to code this in collabedit, which I almost did, except for some small issues in has map.Then the interview ended. I was pretty confident of getting selected for this round. But I was told via email by my recruiter that they coudl not move forward with my application.(heartbreak)Till today, I refresh in my inbox hoplessly waiting for an email that there was some error :'(

I'm talking about the on-site interview. The process began with a checkin and confirmation. Then there was a 40 minutes technical interview. It was not that hard but I didn't make it. After that, we enjoyed the lunch with the recruiter at the dining hall and it ends with an amazing tour in the FB campus.

I had on campus interview. It was fairly straightforward (data structures and Algorithms ) question. But they give you 30 mins to solve the question and are looking for a really efficient solution. I recommend trying to crack down the most effective solution you can.

I applied online to the Facebook website in January. Facebook was really, absurdly fast for me. For the online application, they responded in about a week, and I scheduled the interview in the next week. After two phone interviews, they emailed me back in the same day.The interviewers were programmers, and they made me feel very comfortable. With other companies, I sometimes would get interviewers who knew nothing about programming,…  and it made it hard for me to talk about my projects without accidentally going into too much depth or jargon that they likely wouldn't understand. It was really comfortable talking with the Facebook interviewers, and it was easy to ask questions at the end because I knew they'd know about stuff like the Oculus or what programming life was like there.Like many others have said, I would highly recommend Cracking the Coding Interview. The questions were relatively easy, and two of them were ones I already saw on this site. My interviewers really liked that I spoke all of my thoughts out loud while I was programming.

Applied through a referral and got an email to pick a field within the software engineering internship programs. Scheduled a phone call and talked to a friendly engineer. Went through a couple coding questions and general background information about the company and its culture.

Met with some members of my team on campus, they talked about my interests and I went on-site.I was able to work on projects that I cared about and they provided resources for me to do so.

2 interviews - one on campus and 1 onsite. Onsite included several presentations about the company as well as interview. Feedback after the on campus took about a week, heard back from the on site interview day of. Recruiters were all prompt and responsive - couldn't have asked for a better interviewing experience.

I was contacted by a recruiter and asked the normal job / career stuff. An interviewer callef back and asked a lot of simple Linux networking questions that were pretty much to filter out people who didn't know what they were talking about. The questions were things like what port number various services were on and what simple Unix commands did.I then had a call scheduled with an engineer to…  do a test using a shared writing space. It was a very annoying tool to use and I had a bit of trouble using it because I'm an emacs guy and this was a very different In Bowser editor. Anyway, the problem was to recursively copy a directory structure to a remote file system using an api. My reviewer and I went through the solution I made and we confirmed it worked. I think I must have answered some performance optimization questions incorrectly because I didn't get a call back. He also asked me how I would extend it and I think I gave the wrong answer.

2 phone interviews, no on-site because I had a competing deadline.week 1: interview 1, heard back they want to schedule another interview 2 hours laterweek 2: interview 2, heard back about my offer 4 hours later (since I had a deadline on the next day)

Gave my resume at my university's tech fair and heard back two months later to schedule an interview. My interviewer was honestly pitiful. He was disinterested and rarely spoke (several times I thought the call got cut off). He didn't seem to care about me at all, but simply if I could answer the technical question. When given the chance to ask him questions about his experience he gave short…  answers that gave me a poor impression of Facebook as an employer: goal oriented (as in, finish or die trying), regimented, and not user-centric. The technical question was difficult as well, and I got the impression that asking questions of him was discouraged. I was stopped early, but I think I got the answer later after the interview was over (though I will never be sure as the spec was not 100% clear).

Facebook came to my campus career fair where I turned in my resume. I had an onsite interview in New York which went well. It was completely a technical interview with only programming. I was asked 2 questions - the first was a simple reverse a signed integer, the second was a harder pattern matching problem that could be solved using a prefix tree.I was invited to a second on-site…  interview in Menlo Park. It was a long flight across the country and in hindsight totally not worth the time wasted - I skipped classes and turned in homework late as a result. The on-site was awful. My interviewer showed up late and then proceeded to ask me a very simple question about printing the paths to nodes in a binary tree. Coded it up with some minor corrections (since I was white boarding and you miss some stuff when you're face is glued to a wall). He then extended the question but cut me off because we ran out of time (this was completely his fault since he showed up a good 15 minutes late).They proceeded to give me a tour of the campus and talk with current engineers. It would have been fun if it hadn't been for the bad interview. Overall, I got the feeling that they're a large company and are definitely not as agile as they were a couple of years ago. Engineers were very complacent and talked more about their great perks than personal growth.In the end, I think I got caught in the interview anti-loop and had some poor luck. Promptly rejected. I really wish I hadn't wasted 48 hours flying for that sad excuse of an interview.

I had a first-round in-person interview at my university where I was being interviewed along with many other candidate interns. The questions were not too difficult at all, the first one was basically to implement binary search and the second one had to do with array manipulation. I answered the questions correctly but still didn't advance so I'm not totally sure what they were looking for.

I had an on-campus interview with Facebook on my university campus, which was one-on-one and took about 45 minutes. I was given three binary search tree questions to answer in this first interview. A few weeks later, I had another interview on Facebook's campus in Menlo Park, and got to tour the whole place after with a group of other intern potentials. That second interview was also about 45 minutes,…  with a single question about sorting arrays efficiently. Some of the other intern interviewees had two questions, but I focused on solving the one problem well, and came up with a few solutions, I wrote out code in C++ for the most efficient one. Very cool campus and people!

Met the recruiter at a career fair, dropped off my resume, and was contacted for an on campus tech interview. Interviewed with a Russian guy with a really heavy accent and I could NOT understand much of what he was saying. He also got impatient with me and basically wrote the answer on the board after 1-2 minutes of watching me struggle. Not a very helpful or nurturing interviewer.

I was contacted by a recruiter after the Facebook NY Hackathon. She set up one technical phone interview, if I passed there would be another technical phone interview. After those two they would make a hiring decision.

Got an on-campus interview through the career fair at my university. The on-campus interview was a total of forty-five minutes: first five to ten minutes was talking about the interviewer and about my past experiences and the rest of the time was for one technical question, which was relatively easy. Two days after the on-campus interview, I was invited to an on-site interview at their Seattle office during one of…  their University Days. The interview style was the same as the on-campus interview. They also took us on a tour around Seattle during the on-site.

Saw the recruiter at a "office hours" kind of event a few days before the job fair at our school. Didn't really talk to the recruiter about all that much, but I think they were only offering interviews to people they saw at that event since they weren't at the job fair.

One of my friends refers me. Then, I appeared one screening interviews.Interviews with algorithm, data structure.No behaviour question.No additional question, just coding.After coding, will ask you how to improve the performance, or do you have another way to implement it.

Applied online and got phone interview after that. they asked me only questions at that time and no behavior questions.Applied online and got phone interview after that. they asked me only questions at that time and no behavior questions.

Sent my resumé, had a first round phone interview. 30 minutes, worked through one algorithm. Didn't hear back about another phone interview for 3 weeks, at which point I had already accepted another offer.

Two coding questions:1) print binary tree level by level2) regular expression matching

I was referred by a friend. After a few weeks, I got an email from the recruiter and agreed on a technical phone interview. (After passing it we agreed on a second one; this repeated one more time. Finally, I didn't get the offer - I think it was because I was too freaked (and not at all confident) out during the interviews...)

I got email from the recruiter shortly after my friend in Facebook referred me. The recruiter asked me a few basic questions in the phone and arranged a phone interview. The phone interview took about 1 hour and the interviewer asked two questions. Shortly after that they told me to have an on-site interview in their campus. The on-site interview is 1-on-1 and the interviewer asked me two questions that…  is of average difficulty. But it is very important to communicate your solution clearly to the interviewer. Then within one week, I got the internship offer from Facebook.

On campus interview, followed by phone screen, then an onsite interview. The interview process was fairly straightforward. The recruiters were very friendly and responsive. Facebook looks primarily for coding proficiency and knowledge of computer science fundamentals. They do not test for soft skills, or only very little. Interviews consist of a brief introduction, followed by one or two technical questions.

I had one on-campus whiteboard coding interview, then one 45-minute whiteboard interview at company HQ in Menlo Park. After a six-week long wait, I found out that I got an intern offer.

I had an on campus interview where I had two interviews. Then, I was called that night and was flown out that weekend to Menlo Park. I had one interview in Menlo Park after which I flew back. I heard back the next week that I had gotten an offer.

Phone screen that was mostly coding; onsite that was half coding, half behavioral.The phone screen interviewer was a little difficult to understand; fortunately I didn't have trouble understanding the coding question.The onsite interviewer was awesome. He made me feel completely at ease.

HR reach out to me from LinkedIn, and take one phone interview and then onsite. Though I didn't get offer from facebook, but I really enjoy the interview experience with Facebook, The HR is so nice! They booked two-night stay for me in Manhat, and can directly walk to Facebook in 5mins from the hotel.

After a competition Facebook held on campus I was invited to interview on our university's campus. The interview consisted of a 45 minute 1-on-1 interview with an employee. It was the standard interview, a little chat about your resume/cv, a coding problem, then questions for the interviewer.There was nothing exceptionally hard about the interview. Know your algorithms and data structures. My question involved neither. I had a LOT of fun…  with the problem.My interviewer knew his stuff but refused to admit that Facebook uses Javascript.

The phone interview was brief and mechanical. The interviewer seemed clearly unprepared, inexperienced, and uninterested, as if it was an unwanted interruption to their day. The interviewer had no knowledge of my previous conversations with the company or why exactly he was interviewing me. I was clearly passed his way expressly for the purpose of evaluating my technical ability. The interviewer asked two coding questions, using an online collaborative editor…  to view my progress. After the problem was sufficiently answered, the interviewer quickly ended the conversation.As it has been described to me, Facebook has "streamlined" the hiring process in order to be able to evaluate candidates very quickly. From my experience, this came off as unorganized and unprofessional.My final impression was that the interviewer did not thoroughly evaluated me as a candidate, but sufficed that I could answer 2 standard interview questions quickly and with explanation. Compared to other companies I interviewed with during the same period, this interview was not rigorous enough to really determine quality.

The first interview started as a typical behavioral interview asking about my CV and graduation year. The technical interview after was a brief explanation about Facebook and a technical question on a shared online editor.

Pre-screening phone interview with basic background and administrative questions followed by coding questions. Two difficult technical interviews afterwards, back-to-back, 30 minutes each. The recruiter and interviewers were very helpful and extremely organized.

The interviewer briefly introduced himself in terms of when he has joined the company and what project he has (lately) worked on.Then I was required to solve a coding task.I'd say the task was rather simple, and what the interviewer was looking for was:-- ability to quickly grasp the task at hand-- ability to quickly come up with idea how to (efficiently enough) solve it-- ability to quickly and correctly…  turn your idea into working code.Suggestion: once you're done coding -- go through your code, check how it will handle the corner cases, reason out loud about what you're doing. Don't panic :)Than, at the end you are given the opportunity to ask questions.As you can expect, they'd like to see you show genuine interest in how things are done there, so showing some excitement helps a lot.

The process starts out with contacting a recruiter. I was fortunate to have a friend who had previous interned at Facebook.From there, if they like the looks of your application, you will be given an online screening test on the hackerrank platform - 90 minutes.Advice is to keep calm, don't stress out, make sure you read the question.I solved this task with time to spare, and was able to move…  on with the process. I was given a phone interview, however did not perform well. The question was oriented heavily towards algorithm design and recursion, of which I could have solved, but unfortunately, given the stress, was unable to.

Interview process was fairly quick and simple - one behavioral interview then three technical interviews before I was given the offer. Each interview was about an hour long, with extra time for Q&A included.

one hackerrank, three technical interview.the hackerrank question is fairly straightforward but easiest to do in higher level language.technical interviews were okay, but not hint-ful or anything. made a stupid mistake in the last one and it cost me a lot :(

Phone interview: create an algorithm to check if two strings differ by one character.On site interview: 4 consecutive interviews (1 personal, 2 technical, 1 architecture).personal - count 1 bits in UINTarchitecture - some design with Redis/Memchachedtechnical 1 - Contact lists merge (data structure question)technical 2 - Simple regex matching

I think I have failed in second round phone interview session.the interview lasts 45minutes on skype, talked too much.0. introduced the interview process1. interviewer introduced him self, what product he worked on, and stuffs2. asked lots of questions about project I worked on, and other the problems faced in projects.3. why Facebook, do you use Facebook, is there anything you want to improve.4. coding problem (3 in first round in…  30minutes, second round I got 20 minutes left when start this part)5. questions for interviewer.

Facebook came to our campus and I was pre-selected for an interview for their summer internships. They told me that it was going to be a 45 minutes long interview.The interviewer demonstrated very odd social skills, contrary to the fact that he worked for the major social networking company. Interviewer didn't even introduce himself, or look at my resume or ask how I am going. They instantly put me on…  the white board and asked me to write some code.I politely asked him whether he even looked at my resume. He mentioned that he didn't look at it, and he rather want me to focus on writing code on the board. At that point, I was a bit ticked off. So, I told him that I didn't want to work for a company where people are treated as coders, and not humans. Then, I just walked out on him. The entire experience lasted for 5 minutes.When I emailed the HR person expressing my disappointment, she defended the interviewer by saying that they were interviewing a lot of people and that's why they didn't have time to chit-chat with the interviewees.

I submitted my resume through my school. I was then contacted by a recruiter who scheduled a phone interview. The phone interview went well and they flew me out to their headquarters. I paid for travel and the hotel stay (as well as food) but was reimbursed a few weeks later. The one on one interview consisted of some behavioral questions but mainly problem solving.

The HR made a background check in the first phone interview, and asked me to do the puzzle. After submitting the puzzle, here comes a phone interview with technical questions. And the most difficult on site interview.

**************************************User Experience Research**************************************
Three stages. First, phone interview with recruiter. Then video interview with someone (hopefully) who has knowledge of your methods. If you pass then you're given a research prompt. You present your solution in person to a team of UXers.

This whole process was a comedy of errors. I began by corresponding with a current member of the UX Research team (who was a professional contact only) to discuss qualifications and fit prior to submitting my resume. I submitted my resume with this person's enthusiastic endorsement. I was subsequently rejected by a recruiter under the pretense that I had "no relevant experience", only to be contacted again by my original…  employee contact a month or so later to tell me that there had been a mistake and that another specific recruiter who specialized in UX hiring would be reviewing my resume and reaching out to me to set up interviews ASAP. Within a week I was contacted by a totally different recruiter at a totally different location, who specialized in hiring software engineers and did not do any hiring at all for UX. My original employee contact made some inquiries, but could not figure out what had gone wrong. I spoke to the new recruiter on the phone and she was also unsure why she had ended up with my application, but promised to forward my info back to the correct UX recruiter and email me again within the week to let me know it had been done. I never heard from anyone at Facebook again, even after reaching out to both recruiters and UX Research team members. The hiring process for software people seems highly streamlined at Facebook. For anyone else...not so much.

interview with recruiter followed by 2 video conference interviews, an finally, an on-site interview. For on site, I was asked to give a presentation to 4 members of the team and then met with each on individually. Each member was well prepared and asked many smart questions. one interview was with a member outside of the actual team I was interviewing for. The presentation prompt was given to me 48…  hours in advance.

4 rounds of interviews. In the last round, they asked me to do a moderation of user testing.The HR person was awful. She did not explain what the moderation is about, what will happen after it, how the day long interview would be... and she spoke like a tape recorder

**************************************UEX Research**************************************
Phone call with role specific recruiter, single phone interview and in-person all in a span of a little more than a week. I thought it was great during the in person interview that the recruiter had lunch with you and offered any feedback after the presentation in case there was anything you should be sure to cover in the 1 on 1s. I felt like the recruiter was more responsive…  and helpful than others from other tech companies but that is apparently dependent on who you get.

**************************************Manager**************************************
After an three prior phone interviews at Facebook that happened through employee referrals, I was pleasantly surprised to embark on one of the most pleasant interview experiences of my career. My process went as follows (Day # = Business Day from beginning of process)Day 1(am): LinkedIn outreach from recruiterDay 1: (pm): Phone screen with recruiter - 30 MinutesDay 3: Onsite interview with hiring manager - 30 MinutesDay 5: Onsite Interview…  with (4) Cross-functional interviewers - 30 minutes eachDay 12: Onsite Interview with 1 additional cross-functional and 1 senior leaderDay 16: Video Conference with Sr. LeaderDay 20: Video Conference with hiring managerDays 29 & 30: Reference checksDay 31: Offer PresentationDay 36: Offer AcceptanceLikely similar to others whom have applied to Facebook, I've had experience phone and onsite interviews with their peers including Google, Amazon and Apple. Google and Amazon's process is more consistent given where they are in their respective company life cycles. Apple and Facebook are a little more flexible based on the needs of the hiring manager. I think both approaches work well.Throughout my successful process with Facebook, and in my prior three unsuccessful interview processes, the recruitment team was swift with feedback. Though there was a two week gap between my final interview and when I was notified references would be checked, there were no surprises as the two week processes was communicated to me on the day of my final interview.Facebook and Google each provide white glove service to candidates and they take employee referrals very seriously. Even when it doesn't work out for a candidate, they want to make the experience enjoyable so top talent reconsiders Facebook in the future. It can be very easy to be discouraged when you're notified that a hiring team is "going in another direction" or "this may not be the right fit for you", but the way in which negative outcomes are communicated is one sign of a great hiring process.I also want to compliment Facebook for being transparent in their two-week timeline after my final interview. I suspect other candidates were being evaluated and I had to patiently trust the process. About a week after my final interview, the recruitment team checked in with me and they gave me a courtesy heads up when my offer was coming and references would be checked. It allowed me to circle back with my other non-Facebook job searches and complete or exit.I'm not sure how my experience compares to others but I feel much better about making employee referrals in the future to bring great talent to Facebook knowing candidates will be treated with respect whether it reaches offer stage or not.Facebook may not be the right place for everyone, but I am very happy with my experience and know that if it didn't work out, they would have treated my process with respect given all the time I committed to the process.Google's former head of People Ops Laszlo Bock wrote a Book called Work Rules and I hope there is a Facebook version created that will help other companies adopt Facebook's best practices.

I was recruited over LinkedIn to manage a new team that Facebook was building. The process took three stages: 1. phone screen with the recruiter 2. videoconference interview with the hiring manager 3. three-hour on-site with six different interviewers, all 1:1 except for a 2:1 lunch.Although I received an offer, I turned it down. At the time, I was working at a competing Silicon Valley tech company, where I had…  been fast-tracked into a very quick promotion. Early in the interview process, I told my recruiter what my total compensation and rough salary expectations were.I was surprised, then, when the recruiter made an offer with a base salary that was $12K less than what I had been making. More insultingly, the total compensation of the offer was _$60K_ less than what I was making at the time. The recruiter said the company was unlikely to budge much on either fronts because it was consistent with the level of the role.Needless to say, I found the $60K delta to be an absolute joke. For many, $60K is an entire year's salary. I also couldn't understand why the recruiter would waste not only my time but the company's time by investing in a full-fledged recruiting process, even bringing me on site, knowing that he would be making an unrealistic offer that no one in her right mind would accept.Moreover, did he or the hiring team think that just because I was a petite minority female, I would be a doormat? Even if this assessment wasn't a conscious/intentional one, the offer was honestly a damning testament to the company's utter obliviousness at best or flagrant disregard for diversity and inclusion.

Had a phone screen, then call with hiring manager, was in the next week for a set of interviews. The questions raised were fairly challenging, but not much in the way of strange, offbeat or blocker questions. There's genuine curiosity on behalf of staffers. I didn't get the job, but the overall process was quick and efficient. I appreciated that.

Two quick discussions with two people. Very casual and informal. No trick questions. It seemed they just wanted to get to know me and see if I was easy to work with. Very easy process.

I was hired when we were a start-up. Have been interviewing for years though with new candidates. Process is normal: Phone Screen with HR, than a principle in the forthcoming loop. If the candidate does well in those they get a full interview. 5-7 people interviewing for Technical, problem solving, organization, creativity and culture fit. If that passes a candidate may get 1 or 2 more interviews for clarity on…  final concerns. than an offer. Process takes about 3 weeks unless there is serious competition for the position than more....

I applied for the position online. I was contacted about 2 months later by the recruiter. Initial phone interview with recruiter, then phone interview with hiring group person. Went to Menlo Park shortly thereafter for in-person interviews. Interviews consisted of talking with 5 people in 45 minute sessions each, back to back. On the one hand, the interviewers prepared well, almost all of them coming in with a pre-prepared list…  of questions. On the other hand, some of the questions came off as if they had not looked at my resume at all. I think I handled the questions pretty well as I had done a lot of homework before I went. They had given me a list of the people I was going to talk with in advance, and I researched each one of those people and had their backgrounds, former employers, where they went to college, etc. etc. memorized going in. That research also allowed me to think ahead of time about how I wanted to "message" each person I was meeting with. My biggest complaint about the interview process was that I was allowed almost no time to ask detailed questions about what they were really looking for in a candidate or what the job is really like. Yes, I did get the polite "do you have any questions for me?" , but usually that came when the next interviewer was waiting outside the door, so it was hard to get any useful information in this regard.

The process was long and opaque. No feedback was given following the interview even by request. Standard email forms were used by HR. One interviewer sounded distracted on the phone and not engaged in the process. They expected a lot of specific knowledge about company and wanted you to spend a lot of time preparing

1 recruiter phone interview1 business phone interview4 Onsite interviews by possible peers and superiorsThe recruiter was amazing. Kept me informed all through the process, closed the loop with me every step of the way. Some interviewers were very friendly and others were poker faced but questions were all relevant and tough

Hiring process was relatively quick, but with some hiccups: once they have lost an email and once confused me with someone else. One phone screening, one test task, video interview and several on sites a couple of months after.One tip: research extensively, where they are now, where they are making an impact and where it will shift in a couple of years. That helped me a lot.They made a fantastic…  job of making me feel very welcomed. Unfortunately, I didn't get an offer, but got a lot of important feedbacks.

The interview itself was super-awesome. I felt very welcome and at ease. HR communications were a bit skewed though. After phone screening, a test task and a video call I was scheduled for an on site interview with five different people.Everyone I met during the interview was amazing, curious, passionate, not to mention very smart. I wish I got the offer :)

**************************************Systems Engineer**************************************
- Applied through Facebook website- Recruiter followed up and asked few basic questions for initial screening- Another interview over phone which was technical- Then recruiter took 4-5 weeks to share result of Technical interview. First said its because of vacations, and then some other excuses..- FInally after 4-6 weeks, said that we cannot move you foward- Wastage of time and the recruitment experience was not up to expectations.

Very odd interview process. They seem to care very little about your experience or what type of person you are, but instead focus purely on technical knowledge. Never heard back from them after the 3rd phone interview. After the 3rd interview I was to be phone to California for the final interview(s).

**************************************Market Specialist Community Operations**************************************
I applied online and then got an test then a phone interview for about 30 minutesthe phone interview wasn't so hard but prepare well and you can go to the next step

The initial test was technical test that was done online. There are 10 questions (9 multiple choices and 1 essay in the language you're applying for). I would suggest you to prepare yourself before taking the test by studying from GMAT books or other quantitative materials if you're not familiar/ already forget the subject. The next test is phone interview with the recruiter asking some basic stuffs, what do you…  know about the role, etc. After that, I got a user interview, asking about what I'm gonna do on certain circumstances. After passing this phase, the final interview was quite tough I must say (they gave me several days to prepare though). I was asked to make a presentation on a given topic. There were some interviewers that perhaps gonna asked you questions related to your presentation. It was totally draining my energy and emotion (2 hours in total). My suggestion would be prepare your mental before and practice! The interviewers are mostly nice and helpful during the process, it just sometimes I got freak out inside and didn't give the answers I intended to say.

**************************************Content Analyst**************************************
i was contatced by a consultancy acting for Facebook, had 2 screening rounds with them wherein they checked my language skills, after which i was informed that i have passed and will have a telephonic round of interview from fb. after that round i had a face to face round.

**************************************Data Scientist**************************************
One HR interview, one takehome data challenge, one shared screen with SQL and one onsite with several 1:1 interviews. They check your coding skills and product sense via the takehome, your sql skills via the shared screen interview and machine learning theory as well as product sense during the onsite.They let you choose the language for the takehome and onsite there is no coding on the board. So you just…  need to know one language (whichever you want, although I think they prefer R or Python) + SQL. No C++/Java/etc stuff and no CS algo questions.

A recruiter reached out to me, we did an initial phone screen, I passed, and was told I would do a interview online with a member of the Data Scientist team.I was told by the recruiter that the interview would have three parts: a product/business sense section where you discuss FB products, how you would improve them, and what type of metrics you would use to gauge success; SQL coding…  to show basic competency in coding; and a section on statistics. I was told that the first section would be the most important, and that candidates who struggle on the SQL coding or statistics sections can continue through the process if they excel at the product section. As a result, I spent all my prep time reading about FB products and thinking about how to improve them and how to quantify success, and brushing up on statistics questions, like many of the ones you can find here on glassdoor.The actual interview was entirely SQL coding.I was not really mentally prepared to do live coding for someone else for 45 minutes, and feel like I was gaslighted by the recruiter in being told how I should spend my time preparing for the interview. I also had a lot of problems scheduling the interview; my first attempt to interview fell through because the recruiting team failed to notify my interviewer internally that he was supposed to interview me. (Which I find a bit funny for a social network company.) so we had to reschedule to a few weeks later.Overall: this was a negative experience, and I hope other candidates read this so they are not caught by surprise during an interview.

After referral, got emails from recruiters and reply emails about several questions such as why choose Facebook, the graduation date, the SQL level, etc. Then arrange the phone screening time. The phone screeing contains one business insight question (pros and cons of a method, they seems to be interested in revenue aspect), with follow up SQL queries. And basic probability of the drawing cards as other people mentioned

Efficient, informative, and they gave me a fair chance to prepare. They told me what to expect and sent me suitable preparation material. I did review and practiced a few of the questions in Python.

The interview process was unbelievably long and redundant. Over 3 months, in total, I think I had 4 phone screens, ~10 on-site interviews (across 2 separate days). Many were fairly redundant and covered the exact same areas. It came across as formulaic and bureaucratic. The recruiters I talked to, while fairly responsive, constantly over-promised how quickly we could advance to the next step of the process. I ended up taking…  another offer before hearing the final decision.

I applied to FB through an employee referral. The process was smooth, I got contacted by the recruiter which informed me of the whole process. I had to go through 1 general interest interview where we discussed my background and potential connections with projects at FB. Then I had 2 technical coding interviews and 1 technical statistical interview. The coding ones were what you would expect of a normal computer…  science interview but the statistics one was mainly based on probability theory.

Five interviews, lasting thirty minutes each, with other Data Scientists. Three were some kind of "technical" and two were business cases. I was flown in the night before, given an email with information to help me prepare (including links to similar questions), and treated to lunch at the campus.

I phone interviewed with an employee starting with his introduction and my self introduction. Then he asked me a SQL question, which I spent too much time to make it right. Guess that is why I was not offered to move forward. He also asked my about a question to see my product sense.

The entire interview process is very accurately described here on glassdoor by many people. If you can do what they say in the other reviews, there is nothing unexpected or new really. Only new thing I can maybe add is that I felt coding quickly was something they cared a lot about.

was refused directly within one week after application. sign......why don't even give applicant an interview opportunity? someone referred me to that intern, but the resume still is not being successful....

1st Phone call with HR rep, share normal experience so that the HR can determine if you are a better fit ,2nd round - Video call Technical Interview3rd round- Onsite Interview (did not proceed to this round)

HR contacted me and set up a phone interview. The process is smooth. HR is friendly and willing to answer questions. It took 1 week to schedule a interview and 1 week for a response.

I connected with a recruiter at an on-campus job fair and got on over-the-phone interview. The interview consisted of coding (SQL or Python) as well as a few technical mathematical questions (mainly probability, using various situations with a deck of cards) and some questions about how mathematics could be applied to the real world (how could graph theory be used to verify users' information?).

Took a long time to get through the whole thing, first there's a pre-screening chat with a recruiter, then after about a month I was able to get a screening interview scheduled (followed by a second screening interview a few weeks later) and after all those, I finally was given a full on-site. Overall, it took several months. The recruiters were generous with prep materials, though, and seemed genuinely interested…  in helping me get through the process.

The process was exactly as mentioned in the other posts and doing the problems from other users helped a lot.First round over call, lasting 45 mins;SQL queries(data problems): some data related to comments and postsBusiness problem: Implementing creation of new reaction like happy, sad etc

The process took 2 months. I waited for 2 months after my friend referred me to this position. I thought he referred me to his team, but when HR contact me, she told me this is a general hiring and would match the team later. The interview was smooth, but I didn't pass the phone interview. I might not do well when the interviewer asked me an open ended questions.

Got the interview via internal referral. First step was with the HR. It was mainly to discuss about my interests and to decide which team I should be applying for. It was nice and it felt like HR was genuinely trying to understand what I like to then match me to the appropriate team.After a couple of days I got an email from HR saying I would be interviewing with…  the Personalization team and that the first step would be to solve a takehome test. I won't describe the challenge, but it is very similar to one that can be found on the book "A Collection of Data Science Takehome challenges". Since I had prepared on that book, I could solve it fairly easily.The next step was onsite interview with team members. The onsite interview was really long and it involved a lot of open ended questions (i.e. how would you do this? what kind of problems do you think you will encounter with this approach? etc.). After you would describe your approach, they would go into details a lot to make sure you actually have a clear idea of how to take the project from start to end.It was a really hard interview, but it is facebook, so it is kinda expected. I got an offer and salary was really high so I was just happy to accept!

Pretty straightforward interview process. Both the interviewer and recruiter were very respectful. First had a quick conversation with the HR after which she scheduled me for a phone interview. The interviewer was very courteous and asked me three questions. First question was expected outcome , the other two were SQL based. I think was a little slow in solving the questions, maybe that's why received a rejection ~ also pretty…  sure that there was a better solution to one of the questions.

I applied online and got a call after 3 months. The 1st round was phone screening with recruiter and then 2nd round was technical phone screening and 3rd round was onsite interview.

The position Interviewed is not core data scientist team. I was told that this is a general data scientist hire. It means that the team which you will work for will only be determined by your willingness and the need of a product team after a training camp.The experience of interviewing with Facebook is very positive. The entire process of interview consists of three steps:1) HR screening: HR briefed on…  the job and interview process of this position; After screening, HR will provide a bunch of tips and preparation materials for the upcoming online technical interview. However, regardless the relaxed atmosphere, you should be prepared with your answers to some typical behavior questions asked by HR;2) online technical review: some data manipulation challenges (many similar questions can be found in other glassdoor reviews for the same position), online A/B experiment questions and short analytical questions (I was told that the pass rate of the round of interview is 1/5); From my standpoint, this online interview is mini-version of onsite interview by preliminarily assess the core skill set: statistics, analytical, data manipulation (R/Python/SQL) and product sense.3) onsite interview: 2 sections on analytics (some reviewer called it product questions), 1 section on Math (not brain teasers), 1 section on technical (in-depth SQL data manipulation and interpretation of sample results; 2 section on SWE (whiteboard coding).

Contacted by HR with a quick screening. The phone interview happened two weeks later. The questions are around products/analytical and SQL query. It will help to review some product manager interview questions. Got rejection email in a week.

The technical interview was tough. I was not expecting another data scientist interviewing me about a hypothetical feature -- a credit card info pop-up. Then, the next part was more of a product development question -- how would one develop the Like, Love, Sad feature.The competitive nature of Facebook work environment seems to be affecting the interview process. Even though the recruiters are generous about giving clues for the prep,…  the data scientist interviewer came across as arrogant, esp when they found out I did not have a PhD like them.

Interview process was good. The recruiter was very helpful and interviewers were very friendly. The onsite interviews were back to back and felt a little rushed at times as they were only 30 minutes each. When preparing for an onsite interview day mentally prepare for a rapid pace!

0-Send a resume and wait for a Facebook Core Data Science team member to refer you for an intern position1-Programming Questions and General Questions about PhD Work2-Statistics Questions3-Research Design QuestionsAll of the interviews were by phone. The interviewers came from a diverse set of disciplines and were quite friendly.

It was a pain to communicate with the recruiter. She seems so busy that does not have time for basics. Took several back-and-forth emails and more than a week to book a 10-min phone screening with her. The email she sent was addressed to another candidate. Despite the available time slots I provided, the technical interview was still scheduled at a time that I wouldn't be available. No biggies after…  all, but the experience was just frustrating.

The recruiters were fairly straight forward about the process. I had two online interviews followed by an in-person interview in menlo park. Overall, people were nice-- except for the last interviewer. I just chalked it up to thinking that he speaks to *all* people in a very demeaning manner due to his mannerism.

When first submitted my resume by asking a friend to refer me, i waited for around 3 weeks to get the reply asking me about the possible phone screen time. But it's already Christmas so I made the interview in the next year in January. The first interview is an technical interview. I need to write code on CoderPad. There should be three rounds about technical, statistics, and research.

1 hour phone interview: high level questions on approaching a data analysis problem6 hour on-site interview with 6 different peopleTopics included:    How have you dealt with a difficult person in your current job?    What do you not like about your current job?    SQL questions    Coding on whiteboard: solutions required using recursion and hash tables    How to communicate statistical analysis to non-technical managers    Basic statistics: solving a problem with a two sample t-test, dealing with multicollinearity    Standard questions…  on machine learning: cross-validation, regularization methodsMore time and weight was given to programming questions rather than statistical questions.

Got referred by a connection on LinkedIn, passed the HR screening then had a video conference interview with a mgr. Both HR and mgr are very professional and efficient. I got the rejection update in a matter of hours after the interview.

I applied through university career fair and called up to onsite interview. It took less than 7 days. I wasn't prepared but interviewer was ok overall. I didn't get to programming interview, which I assume a second round.

I was invited to on-site interview. The first interviewer was courteous and professional - we had a nice conversation throughout the whole process. The second interviewer showed up late and angry at the recruiter for scheduling a back-to-back interviews across campus. The interviewer didn't bother to hear my answer to his questions and just typed away at his laptop the whole time.

Ask questions about math, SQL and product. We talked about the resume, then it is time for probability test. After that, we did a problem in SQL and a followed question about product. It is about what can I do given the table in SQL and some other variables added.

Had a recruiter contact me via LinkedIn. Found the whole process very unprofessional and took way too long. 1) none of the people who interviewed knew what I was being recruited for2) none of the interviewers had any non-facebook experience which is generally a red flag for an experienced candidate.3) the interviewer failed me on the technical component due to an SQL formatting issue. I told the interviewer that I…  would rarely look at SQL results directly and always piped them through a visualization layer.4) the interviewer obviously thought that the interview was a waste of time.5) at no point did anyone ask me about my experience. It was always "why" I would want to work at Facebook and "how" amazing Facebook is.

Initial talk with a recruiter. Then a technical phone interview, with a shared coder pad document. This had some coding questions, and some higher level "how would you analyze this type of situation" questions. About 45 minutes for this interview. Then a one day on campus interview, consisting of 6 30-minute techincal interviews.

A 30 minute screening interview followed by a 45 minute coding interview done through the phone with online software. Not too difficult, along with some behavioral questions and general questions about why would you want to work at Facebook. Showing an interest in the product and having specific recommendations seems to be a priority.

I submitted my resume for a data scientist position. After few days a recruiter reached out to me telling me that he would like me to interview for another position in data engineering. It was fine by me to do that since the title itself is not the main goal.The first interview was a screening one and it was easy. It was a very traditional interview, however, the only difference…  I would think of is that the interviewer asked technical questions during the screening.The second interview was a coding interview. It was a two phase process of programming and databases. The programming part was easy, the question is actually easier than all I prepared for and I was ready for a lot of data structure questions, my code ran successfully but the interviewer seemed bitter about it even though it ran and I did not understand that.The database part also was easy, however, the interviewer was very unclear while describing the question so it took me about ten minutes to understand what does he want. He kept changing his requirements and giving me distracting information. I told him I need to know what does he want in order to write the code. I got the code running but to be honest I did not get it running immediately, it took me another ten minutes.After that I felt like he personally did not like me even though my code ran with no mistakes. The most horrible part is that I stayed waiting two weeks and then I emailed him back. He told me he does not know the decision and told me to reach out to the recruiter. The recruiter told me he forgot to send me an email that I was rejected.Honestly, that was very unprofessional. For these three reasons:1) When doing a coding interview, you have to expect that the person might make a mistake while writing the code. We are human beings. But if he gets it to work then he knows what he is doing2) When you set a goal for someone and he makes it, please do not tell him he was not good enough. That puts you in a very embarrassing position3) When you do an interview with someone, even if he is not up to your mighty standards. Please tell him that he is not up to your class

This is probably one of the worst experience of my life in interviewing for a data scientist position. The recruiter reached out me and asked me to study a laborious list of Python, R, SQL, hive, statistics and probability. The recruiter scheduled the phone interview which they constantly kept rescheduling, very unprofessional ofcourse! The interviewer arrived on to call and started with the word "kool" and asked me to open…  the coderblock. He didn't even care to ask what my name was. He rushed on to the first interview question and asked me a probability question and i gave the answer within a minute. Pat came the reply! Wrong answer! (Even though it was 100% right answer). The interviewer kept pushing me that my answer was incorrect. And he started suggesting me to proceed in his own way and he consumed almost 25 minutes on this. Then he asked me a basic SQL question which he tried to complicate it by not providing the list of values in the table and just complicating that it is tough question. He kept changing his stance on how a record looks and what is the unique key. Then he asked me do you have any questions. He tried to act "kool" as if he has invented the world. I asked him what tools do you use? He kept saying we use hive, python etc and tried to act like he was "uber" cool. I would strongly recommend not to go forward with the recruiting process as you will probably waste your valuable time.

Recruiter reached out to me via Linkedin. Two weeks later, I had a forty-five minute phone screen, with focus on SQL and probability questions. Two weeks later I had the onsite with six 30-minute interviews, with focus on SQL, probability, and product management. I ended up not getting an offer, rejection arrived in four days after the interview.

Reached out by a recruiter to go over my background, interests. Followed up with one phone interview, and an onsite with 5 people (Data Scientists, analysts, managers), and a campus tour.Questions are not difficult- preparing machine learning high level questions (standard questions, not very academic focused); SQL querying; Probability and game theory puzzles, Statistics 101.HR sends you a standard email on what to expect in the interview - it is…  more like a formality, if you're a Data Scientist, this is stuff that you do in your day to day work.

applied through an employee referral.didn't hear from the HR for months until the referral asked again.contacted by HR for phone screening. went through resume and asked about previous experience, projects worked on, desired position, etc.Then a phone interview. An employee called, chatted a little bit, and then went to technical questions.

Initial recruiter call was pretty generic. Took two weeks to get from that to getting the initial screen scheduled, with some inefficient email communication. Directions to getting onsite were unclear - I was waiting at the main entrance; turned out that the recruiter was waiting for me in a completely different location. Interviewer was clearly uninterested and bored.

Applied online, which takes more than two month that a recruiter contact me. After contacting me, everything moves very fast. My recruiter set up the phone call in two days, and one day after the phone interview, I got the updates that I can have an onsite interview.Five onsite interviews, one is really horrible. The interviewer did not respect the interviewee, maybe I was not answering the question correctly. But…  he should not only focus on his computer and seemed that he did not want to talk. Later I asked a question which should be very basic question, he just simply answer:"this is internal question, I do not want to answer." God, horrible experience.

Interview process is long and drawn out. As expected, of course, for large tech companies these days. Unfortunately, data science interviews do not necessarily reflect the ability of applicants to do the job they are applying for, and do not reflect a normal day's work. More challenging questions about coding than would make sense for anyone with an analysis/stats background. Instead difficult questions should be focused on problem solving skills

Initial phone screen with recruiter to discuss role, basic requirements, interest, interview process. First interview was with engineer who was administering a work sample using a web room that allowed for code writing by multiple individuals. The interviewer gave multiple prompts for which you were required to generate syntax. For example: open file, merge file, identify cases, merge files, recode, descriptives, basic computations.

First a screening phone call, then half-hour onsite, then 5 half-hour interviews. Almost all SQL & data analysis questions. Some logic/probability questions at the end. Very smooth & good communication. Not much else to say.

Was contacted through email and then had our initial phone call. After that, the interviewing process became a total mess. The recruiter frequently did not respond for days, handed me off to another recruiter, and scheduled interview times which I explicitly said were not possible for me. I understand they are busy during recruiting season but this showed a lack of care for the candidate in my opinion.

I was contacted by a recruiter and she set up a technical interview for me. But the interviewer was late for about 15 minutes for the phone interview. Then we rushed to coding questions. He gave me some question and asked me to code. I would say these coding question looked simply but it is difficult to get them right without bugs in one time.

Facebook has two data science teams, the "core" team (which is the one featured in various news stories), and the product/growth team. I interviewed for the product side, so a core data science interview might be substantially different. From my experience, I get the sense that "data scientist" on the product side is a misnomer, and they are more of the business analysts; while the "core" team is similar to…  other data science teams in the bay area.The first interview is a phone screen (or on-site if you're local). They asked a few SQL and probability questions, and it was over in ~30 minutes. My interviewer was friendly and enthusiastic, and the questions weren't particularly difficult.The second interview was on-site, and involved talking with 5 different people (or groups of people). Each interviewer had a specific task they were asking about, including business analytics/product health questions, stats/probability theory, algorithms, and more SQL. The questions weren't particularly hard or out of left field but they're looking for you to answer confidently and efficiently.The people were overwhelmingly friendly and tended to be enthusiastic about working for Facebook (although, at least 2 of my interviewers subtly admitted they were casually looking for jobs - so, I suspect even employees at Facebook aren't 100% fulfilled by their positions).

Recruiter contacted me to set up a series of phone interviews. I then had 3 phone/computer interviews with different types of employees. Had I passed the phone interviews, the next step is an onsite with 5 interviews. In general this was my first interview of this type and I was not well prepared.

First there are two rounds of phone interviews, followed by five rounds of interviews at MPK headquarter. The recruiter is super helpful and recommend books like 'Data Science Interviews Exposed' to me. During the phone interview, I was asked to answer some SQL questions in codedit website. So be prepared. The onsite visit is more casual. Only two rounds of technical questions, most of them can be found in the…  book the recruiter recommended.

Great process. The recruiters are extremely professional and friendly and they established the expectations of the interviewing process like in no other company I've applied for.I had a first 30 min screening interview and after that I had a round of 5 1:1 interviews with employees, testing me on math, quantitative analysis skills, software engineering questions and SQL. Everyone was friendly and non intimidating during the process.

I was first contacted by a sourcer for a different position, but the recruiter that she connected me to never replied my email. A few months passed, I received an offer from another company so I thought I'd check in with the recruiter again. He emailed back, but ultimately the position he was recruiting for wasn't a good fit. He passed me to a second recruiter, who's super efficient in…  terms of both scheduling and getting back to me with the results. It took him literally less than 24 hours from the beginning of my interview to get me a verbal offer. Super impressive.For the onsite, there were 5 back-to-back 30-min interviews. It was quite intense, and a lot of talking. They should've fit a 5 min break here and there, but oh well. There's a few algorithm questions, stats, design, research background, etc.

My resume was entered into the system by a friend who currently works there, but after a week and no contact, I applied online to a Data Scientist position.Data scientists at Facebook have a totally separate hiring process from software engineers.You have an initial phone screen by a data scientist which will focus on your 'analytical ability.' For those of you who (like me) have no idea what that means,…  it means a tiny bit of coding/scripting in a language of your choice while you work a reasonable, made-up data science scenario. They'll give you pretend access to a pretend database of information, have you write a few queries, give you fake data for your output, and have you debug plausible scenarios for that fake data.I received word rather quickly (two days later) that I passed the phone screen and would be invited to Mountain View for a day of interviews. I scheduled those interviews for 3 weeks down the line.Interviews at Mountain View are grueling, not because of their technical difficulty, but rather because of the interview setup. I was interviewed in a tiny closed cubicle no more than 8 feet x 8 feet; room for two one-seater couches and a tiny table. The wall was a whiteboard. There were 5 back to back 30 minute interviews, and while the interviewers were apparently supposed to ask if I needed water or a bathroom break, they often forgot to do so. The next interviewer was waiting right outside when the last interview ended. After we covered all of the technical content (about which I signed an NDA, so I unfortunately will not share the details of that), I had about 120 seconds to quiz my interviewer about what data science is like at Facebook.I may have earned brownie points with one on-site interviewer for stopping him when he started asking me the same question that I had had during my phone screen. He thanked me and changed to a new problem.I studied for the Data Scientist interviews by:a) coding in python (which I do for my job; they were happy to let me code in python for the on-site interviews)b) reviewing Stanford's online statistics 101 classc) doing a few 'hat trick' type probability puzzlesI was well prepared for their interview questions.I heard back from my recruiter 1 week after on-site interviews and received a generous offer with a fungible 2-week acceptance deadline.

Facebook reached out to me via... a facebook message. I wasn't actively looking, but decided to go through the interview process because why not? Maybe they could offer me something my current employer couldn't. The interview process started with two phone interviews. The first was just information and some fact checking. The second was a bit more technical and I had to show the ability to code and answer statistical…  questions online as one (or more) people watched me type. Then they flew me out for a day/night and I went through 5 interviews in a row (30 minutes each). Facebook has a beautiful Menlo Park campus. Throughout the interviews, only one simple bayesian stats question was asked. Everything else was business questions and computer science questions. I think my training is much more stats/machine learning oriented, so I struggled with a few questions. I signed a NDA, so I can't disclose the exact questions. They asked me on optimal algorithms, standard SQL coding, and business problems. It was very interesting and they did a good job letting me work through things on my own. I think they were looking for someone with more computer science/programming experience than I had.

Applied online and got an email the next day from an HR staff member.1) Screening call with HR staff - just asking about my work experience and motivation for applying. Straightforward. The HR person gave me some information about the position, and plenty of information about how to prepare for the later interviews (below).2) Preliminary interview (can choose to either do on-site 1:1 or phone with online shared-document for coding).…  I went on-site. My interviewer asked a series of basic stats questions (if X1 and X2 are normally distributed (and IID) with mu, sigma, and Y=X1+X2, what is the mean and s-dev of Y?). Then basic binomial stats question - I got a little tripped up due to the nervousness, but it wasn't bad. Then he asked me to conceptually explain how I'd check if two numbers in an array sum to X. Then asked for the algorithm's time-complexity, and then asked if I could do better. Eventually he asked me to code up the faster version on the white-board. He said that he was recommending that I come for the on-site interview despite my having a bit of difficulty here and there. Nice of him to give me the benefit of the doubt. And he gave me more details about the final interview process...At this point I got passed from the screening HR person to another one, and at the same time I got another job offer so I asked to accelerate the process. They were very accommodating, which was really nice. Final interview was scheduled for 3 business days later and I was told I'd know if I was going to receive an offer the same day as my final interview! About as quick a turn-around as I can imagine them doing. Very helpful.3) Final on-site interview consists of 5 quick meetings (30min each) with different analytics team members and one Product Manager. Was coding on the white-board in 3/5 of the interviews. First one was dynamic/recursive programming focused (Python). Second one was database insight focused (SQL) that began with a description of a SQL table and a new feature and then asking what metrics you'd look at to diagnose the health of the feature/product. Then write those queries. He told me what numbers I would have seen from those queries, and then asked me what that would imply to me, and then he had me do another few queries to diagnose what might be giving the skewed numbers he'd given me. Third one started with a straight-forward Bayesian stats question (I realized it was most amenable to the Bayesian approach after flailing with frequentist stuff for a minute), then we moved to a few questions about Recommendation systems and any intuition I had around those. Fourth one started with an explanation of a "new feature" and a graph of adoption rates, then asked me to explain to a non-technical person what the graph meant/implied. Asked for any ideas I had around why the graph might be shaped the way it was. Last one was with a Product Manager who asked what products I was interested in - a few probing questions to make sure I'd done some homework on those products. Then some A/B testing questions where he explained another change they'd made to one of their products and asked me how I'd decide if that was a good change or not. Then some questions about how I'd diagnose why something wasn't working as expected.I felt like I did well - but I didn't nail the questions right away. I got the answers, but I'd bet that I flailed a bit too much on-route for the interviewers' tastes. Sort of a shame since I see a little bit of flailing around as an important part of the creative problem-solving process, but I could understand how it wouldn't inspire confidence in someone who already knows the answer and is just waiting for you to get there. And maybe they just want people who know all the answers already or never get challenged by anything.In any case, the whole experience was very professionally handled. I was very impressed by the transparency of their process. I had seen the Glassdoor interview feedback from a few unhappy previous interviewees and it was clear that (at least in my case) the HR team had seen the same complaints and had corrected things as much as they could. I was impressed - definitely a good interview experience.

This was for the data scientist/business analytics role.a little background on me: I just received my bachelors. I do not know if what I say will necessarily be applicable to people in a different situation.Starting from the beginning: I applied cold with my resume through their website. Then there was an optional coding question. Pro tip: Do it.The question was a bit more difficult than your average weed out question.…  The question was a game theory - esque question, e.g. "given these rules of a game and a starting point, tell me whether player 1 or player 2 will win". They gave me 2 hours for the question. I spent about 45 minutes thinking/writing code (final solution was about 25 lines of python code, the idea was the tricky part), then 15 minutes commenting code and trying to make it look pretty. Another pro tip: The question is timed. try to finish as fast as possible while still giving a solid solution/explanatory comments.Within a few days (maybe one or two) I was contacted by a Facebook recruiter to set up a a phone or 1:1 onsite interview, I opted for the phone interview. The recruiters are awesome/responsive. If they're not responding they're likely in meetings, don't fret. You will be talking with the recruiters quite a bit. They set up phone calls with you (not interviews) just to get a sense of who you are throughout the process. Be friendly and convey your excitement.The phone interview: It was not crazy difficult for me. There's obviously no hard tips I can give you aside from 1) try not to let the phone go silent, always be telling them what you're thinking about, even while writing code. Justify it line by line, this way if you mess up along the way they can point it out before you dig the hole too deep. Then again, don't expect them to point out every error you make. 2) Expect a mathematical question. It won't be some stupid straight coding question like "reverse the words in this string".This interview was a while ago, but i'll try to recall the general structure of it. They ask you some sql like query questions. I didn't know sql, so I answered in python. They asked me to code the question in a shared doc, then after I got the right solution they asked me to answer (verbally) a mathematical elaboration of that question. This elaboration lead into a discussion, and then questions from my end.Soon after I was asked to come in for an onsite interview. It was a greet with my recruiter, then 5 interviews with no break for lunch (which I would recommend). The interviews were a lot of fun. It was 2-3 data science type of people, a product manager, and a staff data scientist.I signed an NDA so I can't tell you what they asked me but the recruiter will tell you the general type of questions they ask. Some questions involved writing code, some didn't. All of them felt like a discussion. (e.g. I offer an important component about answering the question, and they say "but what about this case where your component doesn't help?" and you iterate.)They work heavily with sql, but they don't count it against you if you don't know it. Use whatever language you feel most comfortable in.Tips:Don't be nervous. Smile, I can't say this enough. If you act like you're being shot at it will make the process painful. I even made a few jokes and so did my interviewers. Don't be afraid to laugh, this isn't an interrogation. If you're excited about the job, they'll be able to tell. Don't beat around the bush/avoid questions. I had 10 minutes left in an interview and my interviewer asked if I wanted to stop and ask him questions, I said "no, I like your questions, let's keep going". That kind of excitement will shine through and make the interview feel natural. Just keep calm and keep it conversational. Ask for clarification on a question if you're even slightly unclear about the problem. Try to keep talking/express what you're thinking during the entire process. Also, be creative, they're looking for that.Most importantly, try to honestly convey your passion/excitement for the job. These guys love their job and want to see that you will too. That being said, don't fake it. Your interviewers are ridiculously smart so you won't be able to fool them.Good luck!

This was a very long process. However the recruitment team was extremely helpful in keeping me completely informed at every step of the way (a huge plus).As a disclaimer, coming from years of working in academic settings I have no point of comparison. These are just my personal impressions.I was introduced to a recruiter after one of our students started working at Facebook. He was very prompt in getting back…  to me and setting up a phone call. He then passed my resume to another recruiter (closer to my area of expertise).Over the next few weeks, I had a number of phone conversations with different people (mostly analytic, coding and statistics type questions.) The recruiter working with me was very prompt in touching base with me after each interview, telling me how they felt about the interview and getting my feedback on how I felt about it. After a few weeks they flew me to Menlo Park for an on site interview.The on site interview consisted of a series of five 30-minute interviews with project managers, data scientists and software engineers, all of whom were very engaging and interesting people. Talks were 1/4 about my current work, a bit less than 3/4 technical questions they expected me to work through, and a few minutes of time for my questions about the company, its people and processes.The recruiter reached out to me after the on site interview and scheduled two more phone interview, and an offer was made shortly after the last phone interview.

I heard they were interested in physicists so I applied online and heard from a recruiter within a week. The initial phone interview included a few technical questions but it seemed more like a "cultural fit" screening. They want enthusiasm! We set up an interview on the FB campus a week and a half later. I received an email at 12:30am the morning before my interview with "interview tips". I…  had no idea what I was getting into and would have needed to study for a few weeks in order to brush up on CS concepts I haven't addressed since undergrad. Went to the interview completely unprepared. As much as they advertise that they want physicists they did not ask any questions, or offer me any time, to ascertain how my experience and skill set may apply to the position. They really just wanted a code jockey. While I have coding experience, it was not sufficient for the position. This is understandable but should have been made clear in the initial screening so as not to waste either parties time. Everyone was nice but very unorganized.

The interviewing process was disorganized and unprofessional. i first received an email from a Recruiter from the Product Analysis team. After a screening on the phone, they set me up with a technical interview with a Data Scientist to assess my Python skills.First, the Data Scientist scheduled didn't show up to my interview. They had a replacemen who I could tell did not want to be there. Aside from cursing…  in the interview, he was the kind of guy who nitpicked at code that was functionally the same but not the way he would write it. An example would come to mind is using if/else vs. if/elif. At the end of the interview, I have never seen anyone try to get off the phone as fast as him. It ended like "I gotta go" "Ok" "Click."That ended with a rescheduled phone interview because I wasn't assessed any of my skills. The second phone interview went well, but because I didn't use SQL and insisted on using python they decided i "am a better fit for BI."Well this is the part of the process that angered me enough to write this review. They transferred me to the BI recruiter who had a screening with me. Keep in mind we are now at 4 phone interviews. He tells me he will set up a phone interview early next week. One week and 2 emails pass by and he is completely missing in action. No response to any way I try to contact him. If I have one pet peeve with Recruiters is when they lie to and/or ignore candidates. In my experience with Facebook, I had both.

First a conversation with a recruiter, then 2 short on-site interviews. The final onsite was with 5 interviewers, one of them product manager.

Submitted resume through employee referral. Received call from recruiter about three weeks later. After initial phone screen with recruiter set up phone interview with two people there (back to back 30 minute one on one interviews). One of the interviews was on analytics - a statistics questions and measuring the performance of their products. The other was technical, involved sorting list.Like 8 days later, recruiter got back in touch with…  me saying they were going to bring me on-site for an interview. They set up a flight and hotel room for me. On-site was five one-on-one 30 minute interviews. Two technical, two analytics, and one on product. Really seemed interested in how I would measure performance of Facebook products and use data to identify problems.Interviews set up to run from 9:00am - 11:30am. They just grabbed me from the lobby at 8:45, put me in a room that the interviewers came to, then dropped me back off in the lobby after the last interview without showing me around at all. Friend came down to get me afterwards to give me a tour and grab lunch.Recruiter said would let me know decision within 2 days but no news til 8 days later. Didn't get an offer.Overall, experience was pretty good though the recruiting staff seemed overworked and often missed their own deadlines.

Job application was a prize in a data mining competition. I was contacted by a hiring manager after becoming eligible and was scheduled for a phone interview. I was prepared to answer tricky data mining questions, but was instead asked some basic programming stuff. Was nervous and misunderstood my interviewer.

1. Phone interview with recruiter. They're looking for enthiusiasm!2. Onsite with boss and manager. They don't emphasize that you NEED to know how to code, but it certainly helps. You really ought to understand SQL well enough to do JOINS, UNIONS, GROUP BYs3. Onsite with various people (engineer, product manager, two analysts/data scientists). Various Python and SQL questions. Was also asked to create or take an existing product on Facebook…  and come up with ways to drive engagement.

Was contacted ~month after employee referral.Brief On-Site (because I was local, mostly this is a single 45-minute phone screen): I had two 30-minute interviews - one was mathy (prob/stats) and the other was SQL.Recruiter got back to me in 24-48 hours, invited back for on-site.On-site was 5 interviews: 2 Analytics (prob/stats/brainteasers), 1 SQL, 1 Product, 1 (basic) programming

Two phone interviews, about your background and your project experience, programming tools, few opening questions like calculate yearly tips for taxi manager in LV. I didn't get response after second phone interview.

Initial screening, almost as a pre interview. It was 45 minutes onsite. Everybody is friendly. The work area is an open evironment. There is no cubicles and offices are there for meetings or interviews, I guess. Since it was a pre screening I only had one technical interviewer who asked a somewhat complex question, try not to get nervous. They say they discard candidates based on their character, so be…  friendly.

I have a PhD in computational neuroscience / psychology. The Data Scientist position looked perfect for me because of my interest fitting models to large datasets describing human behavior. The HR person was nice. The interviewer was someone from the data science team-- nice and very young. He had me go up to the white board and write C++ code to answer a few questions. As a PhD, I was…  expecting research type questions, not coding. So I got a bit nervous. I didn't fully understand all of his questions and he helped me. I left feeling kind of annoyed. It probably wasn't the right job for me because I am not a software engineer.

One-to-one Skype interview with manager in US. Discuss experience, skills (stats, data analysis), then walked through how one would test a new feature added to a product (e.g. Messenger) and what variables to explore.Then an online coding exercise with a shared screen (coderpad.io) about processing some data using SQL or another language.

Found job on LinkedIn. Applied on facebook site. Very pleased and surprised to get email from recruiter. Set up call. Beginning --first 15 min-- was him talking at me. Fast. Not interactive. Just telling me about office structure.

All around nice people and HR was excellent! At every stage they were clear and transparent.Round 1: phone screening with basic logic questions. Checking that I knew basic probability, dependant and independant, stats concepts. Total time was 15-20 minutes.Round 2: in-person 1:1. Product analytics case study. If we were to add X feature to Facebook, how would you measure if it was a good idea or not? A discussion ensued…  with each step leading to the next. Total time was an hour.Round 3: a series of 1:1 interviews over the course of a day. Some in person, some video conf. Two case studies like above, 1 math (mostly probability and stat concepts), 1 SQL analysis, 1 SQL ETL.I did not get an offer. HR did call me afterwards and reviewed the feedback from each interview. Super nice folk and I'm ok with their setting a very high bar to enter. Was told that I could check back next year.

After the conversation with recruiter, the interview in the office. something like an hour, conversation 1:1. The all process is very long so it doesn't so suitable for the candidate who is working in another place.

First, there is a screening call with HR. They tell you all about the recruiting process :- 1st round: a video interview with 3 parts (for a total of 30-45 minutes):1 – Analytical Interview2 – Technical Data3 – Math- 2nd round (if you pass the 1st round): same kind of interview with 5 persons in Menlo Park.

Phone screening, then online interview (coding questions), then 4 more onsite interviews ('data science'/modelling interview, another 2 coding interviews, and statistical analysis interview). Some of the interviewers were very kind and nice, some were showoffs and annoying. You are given more chance to show your coding skills than your data analysis/statistics modelling ones, which is a shame.

The interview process consists of a 45 Min phone interview and if you do well you move onto a Onsite Interview with 5 people on their team. You get to choose from 1 programming language such as R/Python/SQL. The idea is to manipulate the data with code and solve a analysis problem.

It started with an on-campus interview that lasted for 45 minutes. The interviewers came on campus to interview candidates. Then, followed by a phone and coding interview with someone in the HQ the next day if you pass the first interview.

The interview process included an original filtering by HR and a call by HR. Then there was a phone interview by someone on the team. Then there was a full day interview process with 5 interviews and then a final interview with someone at HQ. The process took a bit too long in my opinion (from submitting CV to get offer was 1.5 months) but worth the wait.

**************************************Product Support Analyst**************************************
Had 2 phone calls, one with a recruiter and the other with the hiring manager. I was asked to come in for an interview after the 2nd call, but wasn't interested in the role, so I declined.Here are some questions from each call...Recruiter:-What’s your familiarity with the Facebook platform? If you were running ads for your company, would you choose to do TV or FB ads: what is your reasoning?-What…  was your favorite past role?-Did you deal directly with customers?Hiring manager:-Based on the job description, what is it that you think you’ll be doing?-What did you enjoy vs not enjoy at your last company?-Walk me through thought process of how you would choose to handle the scenario of a reporting problem for a big client spending $2M vs a small business rushing to get their ad submitted in time for a tight timeframe/holiday promotion. Which case do you choose to work on 1st and why?-How did you rank your Excel and SQL skills (I had told the recruiter that I knew SQL)? For SQL, gave 2 hypothetical tables and asked how I’d join the 2 to get a certain output. For Excel, asked if I’d ever written macros or done Vlookps- asked how I did vlookups/what I used them for.

The interview was pretty standard. The interviewer started off by asking for my understanding of the role and how my experience could relate. He went on to tell me more about the position in depth and the structure of the team. Also asked about my experience with excel/SQL and told me about the next steps in the interview process.

**************************************IP Operations**************************************
Once you submit your resume a recruiter contacts you to speak over the phone about your career objectives. The phone call lasts about thirty minutes. By the end of the interview you will be told the process moving forward.

**************************************Regional Content Strategist**************************************
Included a call with HR, followed by one-on-one calls with the manager of the job and 3 colleagues - a statistician, a content writer and a person from marketing team.At the end, HR team were kind enough to call to explain why I didn't get an offer - they said they needed someone with more knowledge in data analisis (statistics)

**************************************Mobile Operator Support Engineer**************************************
The person who contacted couldn't dial my foreign number for the first interview. He wrote that if there was another way to have the interview and I suggested by Skype. He was not unable by this way. He just told me by mail that if I had time that day to try. I had been connected all day and he was no showed life signs. It happens for two weeks,…  and today I am waiting at least an explanation

**************************************Product Analyst**************************************
I was referred by a friend who works at Facebook, and it took about a month for a recruiter to get in touch with me via email. I then had a phone interview with someone who works as a product analyst. The beginning was mostly basic interview questions (what do I do in my current position, what is the coolest thing I have learned in my job, etc). Then I…  was asked a brain teaser in the vein of the ping pong ball/747 questions, with a Facebook theme. Next a dice probability question and finally a few SQL programming questions, which we did on a shared screen. The recruiter got back to me one week after the interview, I didn't make it to the next round.Everyone was professional and the process was efficient except for the lag in getting contacted in the beginning.

Initial phone interview testing SQL competence and some analytical thinking. After this, they have an on-site, which consists of five or six short interviews testing SQL, probability/statistical skills, problem-solving with respect to a particular product. Overall a very pleasant process, and it all moves pretty fast, 1-2 weeks. SQL seems to be the only skill they really test for, which is nice, but also many people might be more comfortable…  doing certain tasks using other technologies, so SQL is heavily emphasized.

Applied online through my college recruiting and received notification from HR of a phone interview a few weeks later. Interview consisted up a few dice probability questions followed by a more difficult question on probability. The last question consisted of a few short programming questions. They say you can answer them in any language but they are ideally posed as SQL questions.

I cannot go into detail, but the onsite interview process consisted of talking to various Facebook employees over the course of 3 hours. It was very well organized, and I had the opportunity to speak to employees at various positions in the company. Everyone was warm, courteous, and open to answering any questions I had.But make no mistake, my analytical and coding abilities were tested early on, and later my…  general Facebook knowledge, experimental design, and business approaches were tested. I left the process feeling exhausted but satisfied that I had done nearly as well as I had hoped. There isn't much you can do to prepare for such a series of interviews, other than familiarize yourself with Facebook products. Good luck!

The overall process took about 4 months from initial contact to date of offer. It started off with a recruiter phone screen to determine which analyst role best fit my background. The second round included an on-site SQL/programming quotient mostly around being creative with SQL to get desired results and interpreting data. Round 3 was focused primarily on analytics and business acumen; specifically around metadata. Round 4, the final, was…  a combination of SQL, analytics, and probability.

Interview process consisted of one phone interview followed by onsite interview. Everyone was good to talk to and would always give you hints if you are stuck. Generally speaking, they dont talk much about what work or experience you might have. Their questions are more focused on what they would like to see in the candidate. Overall it was an average interview with general Database related questions.

An initial phone call from a recruited started off the process. There were two 30 minute phone interviews, one on SQL, and one on facebook itself. Following the phone interviews an on-site interview was set up. The on-site interview was five interviews in a row - very quick, and very technical. Throughout the process the recruiter was in contact via email and phone, making it a very easy process.

There were a number of different stages:1. HR screen. They asked pretty basic stuff - behavioral questions and my knowledge about Facebook.2. 1st Round interview - phone. Spoke with a product analyst. They wanted to gauge my analytical skills and asked basic SQL questions.3. 2nd round interview - phone. Same thing largely, except with a PA manager and more advanced SQL questions. With these questions, they were sharing a screen,…  and having me type out SQL commands in response to their questions to explore data about business problems.4. Full loop - in person. Went to Menlo Park for a full loop. Again, this involved a litany of questions about Facebook, ideas for the company, and heaps more SQL questions.

**************************************Compensation & Benefits Specialist, Asia Pacific**************************************
Online application led to a recruiter calling me after a week. She appeared distracted but was cordial. I was informed in another week about being moved on to the next round. I spoke to the hiring manager.Interestingly the hiring manager introduces herself as Head, Compensation & Benefits even though her designation is Manager, Compensation & Benefits (suffers from an inferiority complex??).According to her linkedin profile she has only had consulting…  experience before her role at Facebook. As we started speaking, I realized she was feeling insecure as I pointed to experiences and concepts she could not fully appreciate due to her limited (only consulting) experience. She was pleasant, slightly timid, but not have the sharp questions or insights I was expecting from someone at Facebook. At the end of the discussion, she informed me that there would be 3 more rounds with different stakeholders. I was suspicious given her fumbling during the session. Next week I received a cookie cutter 'sorry' email.

**************************************Senior Product Manager**************************************
3 steps after intitial recruiter call:1. 1st onsite with two sessions about Product thinking and execution2. 2nd onsite with three sessions plus lunch chat (product thinking, execution, leader ship)3. Offer :)

First I was screened by phone, then I was asked to come in an meet with the hiring manager as well as another product manager. I was told upon arrival that day that the hiring manager was out sick and I would only be meeting with the product manager. The interview lasted about an hour.

**************************************Manager, Ad Risks**************************************
Very pleasant first round with HR, basic review of resume and overview of the position. Made it to round two with the direct hiring manager.Second round was started with the hiring manager stating "I talked to Zuckerberg" (this is where they started to lose me) about a difficult scenario facing the team, followed by a lengthy description of the hiring manager's own skill set. The Hiring Manager presented the problem…  and asked for my solution. I provided a response but about halfway into it realized I was talking to myself. It was apparently not the solution they were looking for. No response, just awkward silence.Fair enough - nothing overly rude or aggressive.After the second interview there was a gap of several weeks and a couple follow-ups on my part. As expected, no offer was given. They were going to look for better suited candidates.Overall, the first round went very well. Very pleasant and open interview. The second interview seemed a bit more of a hindrance for the manager.

**************************************Anonymous**************************************
I receive a mail from HR asking to pick a time in the coming two weeks. The interview was for 45 minutes on only one question was asked. I had to code on collaborative editor

Disconnected phone interviews, screens, and then in person interview. They had a position, filled it, but still wanted me to interview. Very unclear on role, level, or who I was interviewing with or direction for the role.Technical "screens" weren't technical, and the entire team seemed to think I should be honored and blessed to be able to even enter the hallowed halls of Facebook.Recruiter, after dropping the ball earlier for…  2 weeks after a phone screen, never contacted me after the interview via email or phone. Very unprofessonal given that I am an executive.As a junior person looking to get a brand on their resume Facebook might be a good bet, but if your respected and entreprenorial I wouldn't interview there again.I assume I didn't get an offer, but I also don't know what the positon was either....

A friend of mine referred me to a job, and I spoke with the hiring manager and corresponding HR person about the role. From there, I did a series of in-person interviews with a variety of people in different roles. Everybody was nice and attentive throughout the interviews, and I received very positive feedback about my prospects of joining the company. However, I was ultimately told there was not a…  good job "fit" for me at the time.

Very nice, extremely talented people. Had very pleasant conversations with everyone. I'm not sure they understood how best to use my skills or what they were looking for on that particular team at that time. They're doing great work in the DC office and it seems like a super work environment.

**************************************Software Engineer Summer**************************************
Applied OnlineTwo phone Interviews - 45 mins each, no onsitephone interview starting with introducing yourself followed by one/two code questions based on time.The first coding question is very standard coding question and the second one is a bit more difficult.

I was contacted via email by a university recruiter. Had a phone interview and the questions were the typical behavioral questions. There was one technical question. The interviewer was helpful,but had a thick accent so I couldn't understand some things he said.

**************************************Associate Product Manager**************************************
2 calls. Don't apply for this role if you have any product experience. They want fresh talent without any experience, so they can mold you into the product manager that they need for the next few years. The interview wasn't hard and was actually very conversational. They were friendly, but the recruiter didn't get back to me for a week after the second one, then lied to my friend saying…  she had already sent an email - then sent it last minute.

**************************************Analyst**************************************
I applied through Facebook online and was contacted via email in less than a week to set up a phone screen with a recruiter. The recruiter was very nice and very laid back which made the process a little more relaxed. She told me she loved my resume and actually said how excited she was about it because she felt I was an excellent fit. After a few minutes, (we…  stayed on the phone still chatting for another 20 min) she indicated she would contact the hiring manager and set up a second phone interview and get back with me. Two days later, I receive an email indicating they have decided to pursue other candidates. I know my qualifications were spot on and my experience was in line with what they were looking for. I'm left feeling pretty confused as the recruiter talked me up quite a bit and left me feeling pretty confident. Not sure what happened. Maybe someone internal was hired? Although it sounded like this role was new for the area. I don't know.

The hiring process was great. I worked with a recruiter who was very responsive over email and even brought me in prior to the interview to meet some of the team. Very professional team and inviting atmosphere. The interview was about 2 hours with one-on-ones with two separate people.

They set up a phone interview so that I could talk with the recruiter. He asked a couple of questions about my experience and how I work on a team. Then he set up an interview with the hiring manager. She ask me a couple of technical questions, how I work on a team, and what was my experience. I got asked to come to campus to have an interview…  with some of the people on the team and to meet with three managers. They asked me more challenging technical questions that had to do with the job. it helped that I completely understood what is was that I would be doing on the job and to understand the job description 100%. They were very nice and overall the interview went smoothly.However, they emailed me a week later to schedule time to talk any time during the week. It was confusing because it sounded like it could be a good thing, but then seconds after taking the call they informed me that I didn't get the job because I didn't have enough experience.

Was contacted by Facebook HR via email after applying for Analyst position online. The HR representative was friendly and we set up a phone interview. The interview was pretty relaxed and straightforward. I was asked to explain a little bit about my background and some work I had done listed on my resume. The HR rep also explained a little bit more about the position description, duties and the team…  I might be working with. The interview ended after about 25 mins with the HR rep asking if I had any additional questions. I haven't heard back about the position since the initial phone interview, so I assume I did not get the position.

This was a phone interview, the interviewer is super nice and helpful. She asked me to introduce myself, what I am doing and why I want to join Facebook.

I submitted my resume on their website and heard back from HR about 2 weeks later. There were two phone interviews and a 2 hour onsite interview. All communication following their initial contact with me was very prompt, and phone interviews were all on time. Everyone I interacted with was very helpful and pleasant, and as I was coming from Google we had a lot in common. I think having…  Google on my resume was what helped me get a response, as I didn't have much relevant experience (I'm a recent college grad).

It's a tough company to get in. I had to do a recruiter screen, another phone screen with a team member, one in house with 3 team members, and another in house with 2 team members - including the director of the group. Mostly behavior with a few analytical situational questions.

First you need to take the online test. It has 10 questions. 9 of them multiple choice (statistics. excel, set theory,graphic analysis) and 1 of them is a assay writing on a topic. If you pass the test, they call you for a detailed interview.

initial phone screening, three onsite interviews, 30/40minutes back to back with junior, middle and senior team mates [all very nice, relaxed and interested in you]. two final rounds with senior and global management over skype and phone. entire process from 1st contact with HR and offer took a month, the entire time your recruiter is by your side updating you via phone and email.

I applied via LinkedIn. HR sent me an email with the link of some tests. It has time limit and non stop exam. I passed it.then HR called me and check my background with me and talked about job details as well.Next step was communication with the Hiring Manager. She was kind a hard person but i was well prepared. I passed it as well.Now I am about the having…  another interview.

3 phone interviews, then 4 30 minute interviews back to back in the Facebook office, then a few days later I was back in for a final interview. My HR contact was absolutely lovely and incredibly helpful.

Just a simple 15-30 minute phone interview. I wasn't sure how I felt about the interview. The recruiter was polite and proceeded to dive right in to asking me about everything Facebook in conjunction with some technical questions. The technical questions weren't difficult for someone that comes from a data/statistics background. I obviously didn't (guess that's why they do phone screens). Then she put me on hold for about 1-2…  minutes. Proceeded to tell me more about the job (read the job description really quickly) and asked if I had questions. Needless to say, I was not what she was looking for and she knew that mid-way through the interview.

There are varying number of interviews in different colleges. I personally had to undergo a total of 6 rounds-a) Written - wherein they tested our command over English. The test though not very difficult, will gauge your grasp over grammar.b) Group Discussion- a group of 6- 7 candidates are expected to debate on 2- 3 topics. Here I believe the key is to put across one's view without coming across…  as too dominating. Being balanced and constantly engaged always seems to work.c) First round (interview) - The first round for me was extremely basic and lots of fun. As I was been interviewed for Online Sales Operations (now Global Marketing Solutions), the interviewer asked me questions pertaining to my favorite ad, my thoughts on online advertising etc. It was a very easy interview and was basically to understand if I was aware of the online platform.d) Second Round - The second round was largely around scrutinizing my resume and later questions pertaining to my future plans. I was honest about when I wanted to pursue my Masters, later got to know that they were looking forward to such honest answers. (Guess lying about you wanting with the company forever, esp if you're an undergrad, won't work :) )e) The next two round were via Skype and phone. Both of the interviewers were there to gauge one's analytical skills.

Began with a 30 minute phone screen, one month later another. Both were great, absolutely friendly throughout. Roughly a month later I was called in for a onsite interview. the process for me is ongoing so I can post more after completion. I'm pretty excited however. It's been fun so far.

I applied for the job online and they contacted me 1 month later suggesting time for telephone interview.

The phone interview was basically a run down of my previous experience, and me demonstrating my knowledge of the company. These guys put a lot of emphasis on prior knowledge of the company, which might be fair given that I was interviewing for a marketing data analyst position.

The interview process was really nice. People were very nice at the office as well. Interviews went by really fast. Not sure what they are looking for in terms of stellar answers. also seems like they are interviewing a lot of people a day, so they definitely have their pick of the lot and can be picky.

People were really nice. Had a few one on one interviews. The office is also a very cool space. The company seems to be interviewing a lot of people, so they totally have a pick of the lot. Not sure if someone ended up getting the position or not.

**************************************HRBP**************************************
Had a phone interview with recruiter, another phone interview with hiring manager, and then in-person interview with 5 people. The questions asked were to be expected...tell me about yourself, your carer progression, what were your biggest accomplishments, solve an ER issue, and why facebook. The process was very organized and smooth - lots of communication with the recruiter which was helpful. Was exciting to see the campus - lots of…  energy and a really great vibe overall.

**************************************Data Scientist - Coop**************************************
2 round interview. 1st round was a on-campus interview which last for 45 min. By the end of the day, they will contact candidates who passed the first round to have a second round interview on the second day. Mine was a phone interview with a data scientist in Mountain View, lasted for 1 hour.

**************************************Machine Learning Engineer**************************************
A recruiter reach out by email, then a phone chat with an engineer, and called out for an onsite interview (6 one-on-one interviews in a day) at Menlo Park. Interviews were generic coding questions, machine learning questions, or career questions, depending on the interviewer, in no specific order.

**************************************Sales Manager**************************************
I was invited to a nearby bar, where I was interviewed by 3 different people in English as none of them spoke my language. Each interview lasted about 15 minutes, all of them introduced themselves, spoke very briefly about the role and then started asking questions they had in paper.

Applied from Facebook job page.Received email about phone interview with a recruiter at Asian HQ. A brief phone screening interview. Sent thank you letter on the same day.After one week, a phone interview with hiring manager. Many case study questions. Sent thank you note on the same day.Waited one month before hearing about on site interview. Met with hiring manager and 4 colleagues. Sent thank you note on the same…  day.There is no communication from Facebook since then. It has been 6 months. Obviously I did not get an offer, but they don't bother to inform their decision.

**************************************Account Executive**************************************
The process started with an online, timed question/answer section which was fairly straightforward and asked questions about facebook. I was interviewed twice more, once by a girl and once by a group of people. The second interview went well, but I could tell I was on speakerphone which was a little nerve-racking. Otherwise the interview process was an overall positive experience and as this was my first ever interview for…  a "real" job I was not disappointed when I received no offer.

After applying I was contacted by a FB recruiter, who scheduled and conducted a phone interview. The recruiter was pleasant, intelligent and asked strong questions with appropriate follow-ups. This moved me to an onsite interview. They did a great job planning and managing my visit to their office. I was asked to put together a mock sales presentation with or with out a deck of slides for a product or…  service I was already familiar with. I was told I would be given 45 minutes for the mock sales call.Onsite - I showed up 10 minutes early for my appointment was taken in and informed that we would be starting the process with the mock presentation for two managers. The first manager entered and introduced himself with only his first name (more on this later). We made some small talk while we waited for the second manager, but after about 10 minutes he decided that we should carry on with out him as he had 'gotten busy with something' . Throughout the process the interviewer kept looking at his watch and finally cut me short after only 25 minutes. I later realized that they were interviewing a herd of people that day and despite being flown in at substantial expense on their part and time commitment on my part, this was a bit of a cattle call. The second interviewer (who also introduced himself by first name only) was a nice young man who essentially had the same position I was interviewing for. He asked me some questions about my sales call planning process and I asked some question about the position and the company. It is here that I found out that the position was essentially inside sales and very little time would spent with customers face to face. This made me wonder why there was such an emphasis on a mock sales call, when the position is not customer facing and primarily consists of handling clients over the phone and internet.Summary - I was scheduled to meet with 3 people but only met with 2 due to a last minute 'situation' for the third person. The onsite interview process was rushed, impersonal and oddly mysterious. I found it ironic that a company that bases its business on open disclosure and communication of it's members acts like the CIA when you ask for the names and titles of the interviewers. Neither of the people I interviewed with had business cards, both introduced themselves with only their first names and deferred me to the recruiter for their contact information. I was then told that they do not release the interviewers contact info to candidates. Really? The office environment was spartan, young and had the ambiance of a dorm room or study hall. The culture was very dedicated to the cause with a clear sense that this was more than just a job to many of the employees but also their social and personal life. Overall, not the right culture or environment for everyone, but if it's your first job, you are none the wiser.

I was referred by a friend to Facebook and was contacted a week later by the university recruiter to set up the first phone screen a few days after the first contact. We went through my background and sales experience which went quite good. There were no brain teaser or difficult questions. After describing what it's like to work for Facebook and what I can expect, he told me he…  would come back to me in a couple of days. That never happened. I heard from my friend that an offer was accepted a few days after my phone screen and the recruiter didn't even bother to let me know.

**************************************Software Engineering Internship**************************************
I had an on campus interview with a current software engineer. He first asked me to talk about some of the contents of my resume, and then asked me to elaborate on a recent project I worked on that I liked. He then asked me a few coding questions. Both went off of the same principle of trying to implement a method to process a certain type of regular expression.…  I coded on a whiteboard, and my interviewer gave feedback as I went along. At the end, he asked how I might optimize the method I wrote.

My interviewer was very nice and seemed like a chill guy. He asked me to talk about what I did in the past and to name a cool coding project that I did in the past for fun. He asked me how to traverse a binary tree in order. I first solved it recursively, and then he asked for the iterative solution (no parent pointers allowed).

**************************************Software Engineer, Generalist**************************************
First HR person took a 30 minute session to talk about the company, work-culture, facebook's bootcampThen after a week first telephonic was scheduled and then almost after every 10 days interval next telephonic was scheduled.Important TIP: Interviewers are very helpful, some people have mentioned that they are very strict but that's not the case. Keep your head cool and answer to their questions patiently. They usually don't mind small mistakes…  in the code.

**************************************User Operations Contract**************************************
Submitted my resume, and got a response within a week! The recruiter was very nice and very interested in what I had to say. You can pretty much find the exact questions they asked here or if you google it up. Then we scheduled for an in person interview. The first person explained the position to me, and asked if I had questions. Second person went through my resume and…  asked me behavior question. Third person was a combination of the previous two people. The in-person interview was pretty intense, in the sense that there was a lot of information given to me. They were all really friendly and cool people. Overall, it was a quick process and nothing was particularly difficult. Just prepare examples, have stories to tell, and ask lots of questions, and you should be fine!

**************************************Operations**************************************
Was referred by an employee and received an email inviting me to do a phone interview the following week. The recruiter who contacted me was very friendly and helpful, asked only a few questions and told me about the next step of the interview process. I'm still waiting to continue on with the process and will update later.

Recruiter was very friendly and great about following up. Functional leader was more interested in what I knew about Facebook (how much I studied up on the company). The fact I'm a professional with a proven long term track record of excellent performance, didn't seem to carry any weight. Also, based on many questions, it was apparent they aren't aligned internally on what exact skill set they are looking for.

The interview process was straight-forward - first was the initial HR phone screen followed by a competency based interview with hiring manager and then the full loop interview which had 4 interviews - mix of both case studies and competency based. it took a while to hear about

Phone interview.More then 6 face to face iterviews with 1 person.

**************************************SMB Account Manager, University Grad**************************************
I had an interview in-person at a Career Fair in November 2015. I had applied for an pre-scheduled interview with them and got an interview invite. No phone screening was required. They sent me a lot of materials to study prior the interview, related to FB products mostly.The interview was quite challenging but still a nice situation, as the interviewer was very friendly. The minus side would definitely be lack…  of follow-up: they told me they'd inform me of their decision in about two weeks, but I never heard back.

**************************************Marketing Analyst**************************************
Spoke with the hiring manager and recruiter on the phone and went to HQ for the in-person interview. Interviewed with five people and received the offer a week later. The process was well-organized. The recruiter also immediately got in touch with the references I provided.

I was referred by an internal employee and contacted by a Facebook recruiter about 2 weeks later. She described the position she was considering me for and asked me whether I am interested. I said yes and emailed her my availability for next week. Soon I was scheduled for a phone interview.The phone interview was rather simple. However, the questions are not well thought. For example, he asked to write…  a query that a certain text field has text. It turned out he is testing for ‘ column like ‘%%’. I am sure there is a lot ways of testing whether I know the SQL keyword “like”. Maybe it is a English issue. Since I had some experience with Facebook’s direct competitor, I felt like the interviewer is more interested in details of how things are running at the competitor rather than in my abilities.I got email from the recruiter the next morning about on-site interview with 5 different people – 1 data scientist, 1 from another group, 1 hiring manager, 2 direct reports of current hiring manager. I can tell that the group is extremely un-diversified in every sense, and all from eBay/PayPal. I spent 10+ years in Silicon Valley already and I know this is not a good sign. My later interviews approved every bit of my suspicions.The data scientist only asked me SQL questions for table join and case statements. The interviewer from a different group asked me “We are going to release a new product. What’s your test plan?” I asked back about the goal and metrics of the testing, she repeated her question again “how are you going to test?” Obviously the questions are either not well prepared or misleading. The hiring manager thought I was a different person, and never read my resume at all. He asked me to walk through my resume. One of his subordinates does not know what rank() function does and kept asking me about it. The other subordinate kept asking me every single bit of details of Facebook competitor operations.In general, the interviewers are not well trained.I followed up with recruiter 2 days later (she said she will have answers in 2 days before) and she said that it is extremely difficult decision. I answered all technical and specific questions very well, but not for open questions. It is very bizarre because I analyzed every “open” question from every angle. Open questions are their weapons to weed out candidates that are not of their types. Obviously open questions are used to cover other excuses or otherwise illegal reasons for rejections.Overall, there is no common understanding between recruiter and hiring teams. There is no proper communication channel between phone interviewer and hiring manager. Totally waste of time and energy.

I had an extremely negative experience with Facebook interview. The recruiter initially emailed me three essay questions to answer as pre-screening. These questions asked me to spend one week designing a Facebook product and a database schema for user analytics. It took me several days to think about it, conduct online research and draw on my past work experience to answer these deep questions thoroughly.A few days after I submitted…  my ideas, I was told that I passed the pre-screening and will enter the phone interview process. I spent the next few days researching into Facebook's products and users but then the recruiter suddenly emailed me, saying that the positions they considered me for had been filled by internal referrals. It made me feel that the two weeks I spent on interview preparation were a complete waste of time and all they wanted was my contribution of ideas on product and database design. This experience made me extremely disappointed with Facebook's lack of respect for interviewees and lack of business ethics. Will not interview with Facebook again.

**************************************Administrative Assistant Interview Not Very Professional**************************************
Ok… So I got an email from a recruiter after applying online at Facebook.com for an Admin position. Which not to mention but I have over 9 years of experience and considered my self over qualified based on what the job requirements outlined…. So I respond to the email that is asking what time I would be available to connect over the phone. I’m thinking to my self awesome time…  to prepare for what I think is going to be a lengthy phone screening. So we schedule she is 10 minutes late calling and she asked me 4 questions… Yes only 4. So here they go… 1) What does your day consist of? 2) Why do you want to work at Facebook? And 3) What is your current salary?. So I answered all the questions thinking I passed with flying colors… What else is she going to ask that has to actually do with my personality and the job? Then here goes the 4th question. Do you have any questions for me…. As I think to my self What were done, this is it, this cant be it… Okay so I ask 3 questions and after she answers them I give a little feedback to show my qualifications. Then she tells me so you will be getting a call back from me in a few days to schedule an interview with 3 of the EA’s… AWESOME sounds promising. So almost 3 weeks passed and no call or email… Well got an email letting me know that they are not interested. So the recruiter who called sounded way tooo busy to even want to talk to me or ask me anything. Not my lost… Good luck Facebook with hiring talented people with your recruiting team I would like to see who they hire.

**************************************Data Scientist, Analytics**************************************
At first, the Facebook guy introduce the role of data scientist in the Facebook product team. And then I describe my background. But those are not important. The most important things for the Data Scientist, Analytics in Facebook is the product sense and the SQL skills.

For context: I graduated with a MS in CS in May 2014.Applied through LinkedIn and was later contacted by HR via email asking to schedule a phone screen. Completed the phone interview and was the invited onsite for more interviews. Standard full-day interview process with lunch, etc. Interviewers were all very smart. I did not have difficulties understanding any of them (accents, etc.) as some on Glassdoor have mentioned. Questions…  consisted of experimental design, product health metrics, statistics, probability, SQL, and (software engineer interview-style) programming questions. Some of the probability and statistics questions were quite difficult. The interviews were hybrid PM/statistician/developer style which made it difficult to prepare for.Note: this is for the Data Scientist, Analytics and not the Core Data Science / Research Team.

**************************************Contract Recruiter**************************************
4 rounds of back to back face interviews within the day, allocated around 30-45 mins each session. The overall experience was good and they made the candidate who came for interview comfortable and the hiring managers were very open about the role / culture / expectations and likely challengers this role would face.

**************************************Electrical Engineering**************************************
Applied online through Facebook careers website, was contacted for a phone interview about a month later and then a second video interview the next day. Unfortunately, the job description did not match what Facebook was looking for and it was in a different area of EE than I am specialized. I wish that they had mentioned this in the listing.

**************************************Quantitative User Experience Researcher**************************************
I first had a brief screen with a recruiter. After that, I had two separate video interviews with user experience researchers. After passing these, I was scheduled for an onsite interview. They sent me an exercise 3 days in advance of the interview. I was told to prepare a 30 min presentation on the exercise. This was presented first thing during the onsite interview, to 4 people from the team.…  I then interviewed with each of those team members.The process was quick - I got responses the next day for almost all interviews. The recruiters were great and helpful, and the researchers were very nice, interesting, and fun to talk to. Unfortunately I did not make the cut.

The hiring process could not have been better. My recruiter was incredibly friendly and always kept me informed of the next steps in the process. All of the people I interviewed with both on the phone and on-site were knowledgable, passionate, and easy to talk to. At all stages of the process, I felt like I was brainstorming ideas with colleagues as opposed to being interrogated.Coming from academia, I know…  they were looking for how I would translate my skills to a product-oriented environment. What was great was that they didn't expect me to have the *best* solution to every answer, but instead wanted to know what my thought process was.

Submitted resume online and I was contacted by a recruiter shortly after. Interview process consisted of an initial phone screening with the recruiter, followed by a written (2 page) research proposal that I was given 48 hours to complete. Next up was two separate 1-on-1 phone interviews (~45 minutes each) with members of the research team. The onsite interview consisted of a research proposal/presentation first thing in the morning (~…  1 hour), followed by lunch with my recruiter and four separate 1-on-1 interviews (~45 minutes each) in the afternoon.My recruiter was incredibly helpful throughout the interview process, and everyone I interviewed with on the phone or met onsite was very friendly and knowledgeable. All of the questions were completely fair game (no trick questions), and the interviews felt more like conversations with peers (e.g., at one point we were brainstorming research ideas and drawing study designs on the whiteboard together).Overall a very positive experience!

**************************************Software Engineer Intern**************************************
One phone interview and one onsite interview. The process is relatively quick because I contact the HR directly.The interviewer and the HR are very very nice. Talking to them really makes me feel relaxed.I had the onsite interview at Facebook New York office. The working environment there is just amazing. I think if you enjoy the job as a software engineer, you would love that.

Contacted me over email after submitting to Facebook U. I had an interview with an engineer a month after I submitted my resume. The recruiter was very friendly and kind throughout the entire process.

Two interviews, back to back, 30 minutes each. They were reasonably difficult, but nothing too difficult. Given the time constraint, it can be very hard to through all the questions. Post-interview however, the recruiter took us out to dinner.

I was interview for a internship position. The interview was on-campus and was relatively easy.

I went to the career fair at my school and talked to Facebook, submitted my resume. They got back to me after around 2 weeks inviting me for an on-campus interview. The interview went well, they just wanted to know how you approach the problem. I think I've made a bunch of small "brain-not-working-in-interviews" mistakes but the interviewer was very nice. The second day they invited me to an onsite…  at Menlo Park.

Contacted through recruiter, on campus interview 45 minutes.

Reached out recruiter on campus career fair. Got campus interview and later on-site interview. Since I had another pending offer deadline before the on-site interview date, they rescheduled the on-site interview via phone (which is a pity). The on campus interview (45min) only had one question on whiteboard I made it smoothly. The phone interview, however had two questions in 45min. I spent 30 mins on the first one and…  didn't finished the second question, but the interviewer was super nice! He gave me some hints on the second one and discussed with me about the question when I knew I already ran out of time. He even answered my question patiently. I had a pending offer deadline and requested a quick feedback, and two days later I got the offer! That was awesome since I didn't expect to get it at first.

Campus Interview. The interviewer is very nice and friendly. It is a 45 min interview.

The guy is cool and nice. When I ask for a little clue, he said thanks for asking and the clue really help me out with the solution.

Recruited through college fair. Process was quick and easy and recruiter was very prompt.

The questions are challenging. I survived to the second round which I think I did pretty good. I did not got the offer mainly because the first one I think. I cannot tell exactly what questions they asked, but I would only say cracking the coding interview is a book you have to digest. I found the all most same question on it.

I received a mail from HR to give my basic information and programming skills. There was no phone interview with HR at all so we arranged technical interview through mail. The interviewer was very nice and polite, so you don't have to be scared at all. It will help you if you stuck.

I emailed the recruiter and requested an interview. My first round interview was on the phone a week or so later. I heard back 3 days later.

Applied through campus recruiting and was contacted by a recruiter for an on campus interview. Interview was one on one, an hour long, and was all coding questions.

A friend from Facebook referred me. A recruiter called me few days later.She sent me an email, asking general questions like: "When do you graduate? How often do you code? Strongest programming languages?"After answering the email, I had an initial chat with her over the phone, where she asked general questions like: "What office do you prefer? Would you consider a position in UK after the internship?"One week later I…  had the first technical interview. The interview started with 5 minutes of questions about my work, then we jumped into one coding interview question. The question was simple: Write a function which given two binary numbers as strings returns the sum of them in binary. 5 minutes for my questions at the end.Few hours after the interview, I got an email from the recruiter saying that the feedback is very good and they would like to schedule the final interview.The last interview was easier than the first one: "Given a list of strings, return a list of lists, where each list consists of words that are anagrams." Example: Given ["cab", "cz", "abc", "bca", "zc"] the output should be: [ [ "abc", "bca", "cab"] , [ "zc", cz"]]. I managed to finish this question quite fast (after only 15 min). The interviewer wanted to finish the interview after 15 minutes, but I insisted to get another question. The next question I've got was even easier: "Write a function which returns the nth number of Fibonacci". When I've seen the question I jumped straight away implementing it (took me like 2 minutes), then we compared the iterative method with the recursive one.After the interview, I got an email from the recruiter saying that my coding skills are very good, but the interviewer complained about the fact that I was a bit careless when answering the questions, and that I didn't explained him the Fibo solution before writing code. They wanted to schedule another interview.One week later I had the last interview, which was some kind of giving me another chance, because they usually have only 2 interviews.The last interview was much more difficult than the other two. The first question was: "Write a recursive function which given a string, prints all the subsets of it." After solving this question, he added one constraint. Now what if you want only unique solutions? This was quite hard, and I only managed to solve it after he gave me one important hint.The second day I received a standard rejection email.

They came to the campus, gathered email addresses & resumes. A few days later they sent an email to everyone who got preselected for an interview. The interview takes 45 minutes, and the next step is either an on-site interview in california, or another phone interview, or no more interviews depending on how you did.

The first one was an on-campus interview. It was 45 minutes long and consisted of 2 coding questions. The first one was checking if a string is palindrome the second one is to print out all the subsets.The second round was two weeks later. It was a 45 minute phone interview. The question was to multiply two numbers that are represented in string.My advice is that don't panic when you…  are given a hard question. I did not finish my last question and luckily still got the offer. Just try your best to show them how you approach the problem and be passionate and confidant!

I spoke to an engineer at a university career fair and gave them my resume. I was contacted the next day for an on-campus 45-minute interview. The interviewer was nice and got straight to the technical questions. He asked two. The first was easy, and I spent the rest of the time on the second. He gave me hints as I struggled along.I was told we would receive feedback in…  the next week. I got an email a week later about flying to their Menlo Park, CA HQ for an on-site interview and tours/talks. The schedule consisted of one 45 minute interview, and the rest of the day was lunch, a tour, and two tech talks. It was very relaxing! The interviewer asked me one technical question and built it up a bit, and then he asked me about the most recent bug I encountered.It took them three weeks to get back to me, which made me think I didn't get the job, but I got the offer in the end!They were really nice and really wanted to get to know you as a person, not just whether you know your algorithms. They also really cared about showing their interest in hiring you, which was a plus and not something you get at a lot of big tech companies.I had a great experience!

I applied during the on campus career fair and got a call for an interview couple of weeks ago.

I applied to FB through my university and on their website. They called me in for 2 on campus interviews. Normally afterwards you would then go on to a day of on-site interviews, but they directly gave me an offer after the on campus interviews. They were very nice and very quick to respond.

It was a really fast and straight-forward recruiting process. I had a phone screen with a recruiter, then two coding interviews with Facebook Engineers with two coding questions each. Next day after the second technical interview, I got an email telling me that I've been accepted as an intern for next year.

Campus Interview

I contacted my school recruiter and had a phone screening with her after a week. Then I was scheduled for a technical phone interview for the following week. The interview was easy involving basic data structures, but my interviewer seemed disinterested the whole time. I would ask questions, but there was just silence until I 2nd or 3rd time.I was asked 3 coding question, I gave the most optimal solution…  to all. I copy-pasted my code after the interview, and everything compiled and ran perfectly.I did not get an offer because apparently I was not "quick enough". Oh well.

They usually have one interview and if you clear that you have another interview. Mine were on consecutive days. Each interview was 30 mins. They do not spend too much time chit chatting and usually get right to business. They focus on how you approach the question more than the if you actually got the question right or not

Initial contact: Facebook programming puzzle (powered by InterviewStreet) -- over an hour to complete a medium-difficulty algorithm exercise.Recruiting process: Contacted by recruiter, had a brief talk followed by two phone interviews. Interviewers seemed very knowledgeable and passionate about both Facebook and tech in general. Know your data structures and complexity theory!Offer: Was sent an offer quite soon after the interviews.

Algorithm questions - be prepared to code and optimize (know big-O) on a whiteboard.Review important data structures concepts.

The process was ridiculously fast. Went to a job fair at my university on a friday, met with a recruiter and gave him my resume. They emailed me the following sunday night and set up an interview for the very next day. I didn't get a chance to prepare at all. The interview questions were about basic data structures such as linked lists.

Resume given in career fair. Got interview within 2 weeks. 45 minute coding interview contained one question with binary search and one question about finding anagrams in a string.Waiting for results.

I was invited to interview on the phone.

Facebook recruiters come to my university each year to recruit talent. In November, a recruiter reached out to me to see if I would be interested in an opportunity at Facebook during the summer. I hadn't been looking for internships at the time, nor did I apply to Facebook, so I was pretty surprised by the message. After I told them I would be interested, I had a phone screening…  with a recruiter, during which they asked me pretty basic technical questions (a question about Java key words, can't remember the rest). I did well enough to pass this stage and then I was given the option to go for a phone interview, or an on campus interview. My recruiter told me that candidates usually do better during on campus interviews, so I was scheduled for one a month later. My on campus interview went really well, and the interviewer was really nice and easy to talk to. I got a message from my recruiter that night that I would have the opportunity to fly out to their main office for a final round interview. I attended their "Intern Day", which was a day filled with one 45-minute interview, an informational session about the internship program, a tour of the office, talks given by current Facebook engineers, and also lunch in their cafeteria. My interview could have been better- I got the answer, but I stumbled a bit along the way. I recognized my errors pretty quickly and was able to correct myself throughout the process, so I think this was a plus. I was contacted the week after my interview about different internship positions available at Facebook. After considering the options, I was given an offer for the SDE intern position about a week after that. The entire process spanned 5 months, but it was totally worth it!

Facebook came to my school to conduct on-campus interviews for prospective interns. I was placed in the room with one of the engineers, where he asked me why I wanted to work for Facebook, gave me two technical programming questions, and allocated 5 minutes at the end to ask about his work and any questions I might have about the company.

I got the interview on campus. There were 2 coding questions. It went well and I could solve the problems, even though I got stuck on explaining complexity and answered them incorrectly. But the interviewer explained me the correct answer and how to calculate it. I thought I wouldn't pass, but I made it and had to fly to Menlo Park!The experience at Facebook HQ was great. Nice weather. Nice…  people (candidates and campus tour guide). Nice food! There was only 1 interview in the morning (I heard there were 3 rounds for full-time). It was 45 minutes, consists of general questions and 1 coding question. I didn't do well for the coding one. I couldn't solve the problem and tried so many ways to solve it. Finally, the interviewer gave me the approach to solve it, and let me code. I didn't code well though, so many mistakes. After the interview, I had a tour around the campus. I still shocked from the interview and thought I wouldn't pass.. and I didn't :)However, I really had a great time at Facebook HQ. I thought about the question again and it wasn't hard.. I had to be more prepared!PS. Don't take limo!!! They won't reimburse you for that!!!

Pretty quick. I went through 2 on campus interviews. The interviewers were friendly, and did not try to intimidate you. I did not think I did very well, but I still received an offer by the end of the week. From what I got from it, they do not have a very high standard for highering interns, but when it comes to extending an offer at the end of the…  internship, they prune aggressively.

Have three rounds of interviews, one on campus, one phone and one onsite. Questions are those you would normally expect

Submitted resume in Campus Recruiting. Got an phone interview and an online test. In the phone interview, the interviewer asked questions on my resume, and some projects I did. Then he asked a programming problem. Then the HR invited me to a online test. The online test is on interviewstreet.com. The problem is not very easy.

They came down to our campus to hold 2 rounds of interviews.

I was invited to a on campus interview with a Facebook representative. It was a 45 mins interview with one technical question.

I talked to a recruiter at school career fair. Got a 15-minute phone screening after 1 week, during which she asked me some background questions related to my resume, and told me a little about the position and the interview process followed by a few technical questions. The questions are pretty basic and easy. Then she scheduled an on campus interview for the week after. It was a 1-1 pure…  technical interview which lasted 30 min. I was asked a coding question which involved sorting and data structure. Nothing unexpected.

Stopped by Facebook's table at my university's career fair to drop off my resume.Got an email in about a week saying they wanted to interview me at my university's career center. If I did well on my interview, they would schedule another one for me the next day.First interview was 30-min, one technical coding question and "Why Facebook?"Found out that evening that I was invited for another interview the next…  day.Second interview was 45-min, 3 technical coding questions and "Why Facebook?" (again)Recruiter emailed all my university recruits saying they would collect results and let us know within a week.Tuesday, got an email from my recruiter saying I did well on my interviews. She introduced me to a different recruiter, to whom I had to send my availability for a phone call to discuss next steps. I thought I needed to schedule another interview; however it turns out my recruiter was calling me to extend me an offer.

Contacted by a recruiter and had an easy HR phone interview. The technical interviewer asked me to write a function that determines if a string is an palindrome. Wasn't terribly hard and I thought I found the solution, but wasn't given a second interview. Oh well...

I had 1 interview witj recruiter by skype and 2 technical interview. Interviewers answered for my question about Facebook

The interview process comprised of a technical round held at my university. My interviewer was very polite, and patiently explained the problem statement to me. I asked for further clarification of the problem statement, to which he mapped out the problem on the whiteboard. The challenge involved writing code in whichever language I was comfortable in. The problem was to convert roman literals into its equivalent numeric value. I used…  the whiteboard to solve the problem. I walked the interviewer through the solution and he asked questions on edge case scenarios.Overall, the interview went ok, but I did not receive a next round call. This was probably because my solution was not optimal and upto their expectations. It was a good experience and I learnt a lot from it

I submitted my resume on my college's career development website in January. I got an email from Facebook saying that they wanted to interview me about a month after I sent them my resume. They scheduled one 45-minute interview for me, during which I had to solve 2 different programming problems. When I passed the first interview round, they scheduled a very similar 45-minute interview within the same week. The…  whole interview process took only 2 weeks, and they called me about the offer in 2 business days. This was definitely the most efficient hiring process I've ever been a part of.

The first round of the interview is by a HR. She asked me some basic question of data structure and algorithms. And then she asked me to solve the puzzle whose difficulty is more than "meal".I solved the puzzle in the weekend and send back her mail, and then she arranged an engineer to give a technical interview in the next week.The technical interview is made up of three questions…  and all of them are about coding.The first two are not that difficult, and easy to get the solution.The last one is some difficult.I get a declined mail in the next Monday after the interview :(

All the interview questions are technical and straight forward. There were 2 rounds, both on campus. Each took 30 minutes or so. The questions were not hard. They just wanted to see how you solved a problem. I got the offer 2 days after my 2nd round. Their recruiting process was really fast.

Gave resume to recruiter at college career fair. Heard back in a week, and scheduled an on-campus interview. Passed that interview and scheduled a final interview. Passed that one too, and got an offer.

A short 15 minute phone interview with a recruiter was followed by an interview with an engineer. I was asked about projects I had previously worked on and for examples of challenges I had to solve in them. Afterwards programming questions on algorithms with space and time constraints were asked and had to be solved in an online editor.

1 phone interview and 1 skype interview and 1 on site interview. Asked first questions about my studies and how there ere related to computer science, how Facebook motivated me and then on the sky interview technical questions that you would find on cracking the coding interview. Recruiter was very nice and tried to help as she could. The an engineer performed the interview.

Online Application, was very simple, no motivation letter needed. A recruiter aswered just 4 days later with more questions regarding my work experience. Invitation for a 45-phone interview came the next day.The interviewer asked me about the most exiting project I have done so far, and why I wanted to work in frontend. The technical question wasn't really hard, but I just too many dumb errors.

Applied online posted my cv. Was called approx 2 weeks later scheduling a phone interview. Got the phone interview asking :- Why Facebook ?- Do you have a preference in which offices you would want to work ? (I guess because I live in Belgium)- Favorite coding langs ?- How many hours do you code besides school projects ?1 week after the phone call they setup a technical phone interview…  with a coding question. No response as it is weekend, and the interview was on Friday.

2 phone interviews.Interviewers were asking standard questions very similar to those that can be found here or on careercup (traversing trees/graphs, woking with matrices and vectors, picking up numbers with certain properties in sorted/unsorted arrays). At first interview I solved 3 out 3 problems and on the second one fully and second sub optimally + I was almost done with the optimal solution, but I've run out of time.Unfortunately it…  wasn't enough to get an offer.

There was a lecture on our university that was given by Facebook employees and they gave us a link to apply online on the Facebook site. I applied and the recruiter contacted me in less than a week. She was super friendly and flexible so we arranged a Skype interview on a date that worked for me.On the first interview the interviewer was late for about half an hour, he…  apologized and I said it was okay and it went fine. I was asked 2 questions about data structures, one of which was from the book I was preparing from. The next day I got an e-mail from the recruiter that they wanted another interview and once again they worked around my schedule. All the way through my recruiter was very fast when it comes to sending e-mails.The second interview went a bit worse than the first one, far from a perfect interview. I got two questions again and the interviewer didn't give me plenty of time to think. For example, the interviewer pointed to wrong things in my code before I said I was done with it. After I said I was done with the code, I was asked whether I can make it better, so I did make it better, but I was given a hint before I started coding even though I would probably come to that conclusion, but I guess that the interviewer wanted the interview to move a little faster than I was most comfortable. Anyways, I coded the better solution. Then I was said that there exists a better solution and I didn't know how to make it even better, so I said that I would have to think about it, but we were right about to be out of time so we stopped. I was also said that I can expect to hear from my recruiter within a week.My recruiter, who was very fast in answering up to this point, didn't contact me at all. I was a bit dissappointed because I thought I didn't pass the interview. I waited for a little more than a week and then sent an e-mail to ask whether there are any news. The next day she responded and apologized for not contacting me (she said there were some issues with the recruiting tool). And later they told me that I passed through. So I guess I wouldn't get it if I didn't ping my recruiter, so don't be afraid to do it, I was weighing to send an e-mail or not :)

I was contacted about 2 weeks after I was reffered and had a phone chat with a recruiter about my background, followed by 2 technical interviews on Skype.First round - Two problems, the first one asking to determine the depth of a tree and the second to find the square root of a number (ground value).Second round - One problem involving a matrix with elements equal to 0 or 1

The process started out with a pre-screening test which was coding based. There was one question to be done in 60 minutes. The question was fairly simple for me and I completed it quickly. Then, I was called for the onsite interviews a week later. The interview was supposed to last for 45 minutes. Now, in my interview, I was first asked about the best experience I have had in…  my last two years. Then, the interviewer quickly moved on to the coding questions. There were two questions for which I had to explain my solution and then code it on the whit board. I was able to both the questions, but I guess the interviewer might not have liked the way I had explained my approach as I was not called for the next interview. The interviewer was not very vocal and did not really participate in the discussion where you explain the approach. That is why it becomes difficult to detect if the interviewer is understanding your words or not. Anyways, it was a some experience.

I have applied during on campus recruiting. I was asked to complete online programming challenge. After successfully doing that I got a phone interview. I was really well matched with the interviewer as he was sharing my interests and holding position I was interested in. The interview questions were very simple, however I didn't get the position.

Received a call from an engineer in the US and I did not managed to solve the challenge. Got some questions about my studies and my career.

Applied online and was contacted a month and a half later. Scheduled for an interview with one of the engineers. My interviewer was terrible to say the least. She sounded like she hadn't slept for the past week and was slightly patronizing. But what's worse, she discounted me for A CORRECT ANSWER and insisted that her WRONG method was correct. I was really surprised as one would not expect an…  engineer at FB to make such a basic mistake

It was a phone interview. Started with a nice introduction and the digged in directly into the problem

I contacted a recruiter over linkedin. She send it over to her collegue and after about one month I got an answer that they wanted to interview with me. The process then was very fast and nice, the people were very nice and friendly and the response time was very quick.

Got contacted by a recruiter via email. Had 3 Skype interviews, each 1 hour. Format was all the same: something from resume, questions for me, then questions for them. Be sure have thoughtful, provoking questions for them about their technology. This is where I think I exceled the most, as I did some intense research about their systems beforehand

I handed in my resume in the career fair at school. And it contained 3 interviews.1st interview: the next week after I gave them my resume. 45-min on-campus interview. two technical questions.2nd interview: the next day after the 1st interview. 45 min on-campus interview. one technical question and some general questions (the interviewer also went through your resume with you).3rd interview: two weeks after the 2nd interview. (not everybody has…  to have the 3rd one, but i think i did not do very well on the 2nd.) 45-min phone interview. 2 technical questions.One week after the 3rd interview, the recruiter sent me an email, and said congrats. (but she did not say if i would get the offer or not) The next day, another recruiter called me and gave me the offer.

Submitted my resume at my Uni's job fair. After ~1 month of nothing, I got an e-mail for a quick 5 minute, non-technical "interview". It wasn't anything else but basically telling me I'd been chosen for a technical phone interview.My interviewer was hard to understand, but was polite overall. We used Collabedit to work on a problem. The coding problem was:Given 2 arrays sorted in ascending orders (a[n] and b[n*2])…  with the second half of array a[] being empty, create a function that merges both arrays into a single sorted array. I first used a naive approach, which had O(n^3) time. I then came up with an nlog(n) solution. I couldn't polish up my logic for the O(n) solution, although I was quite close.Took me too long to come up with a solution, so I failed the interview.

I was contacted shortly after a university career fair. The interview was schedule two weeks after I was contacted. They said that after the first interview there would be a follow up interview the next day if I did well on the first one.

No surprises, multiple technical interviews...some challenging ones.

Got the first interview through school career website. Process consisted of 2 on-campus interviews plus a phone interview since I was a borderline case.

Intervier asked me general questions about "Why facebook?" and "Tell me about your project from university or job". Then there were coding problems I had to solve. All of them were pretty easy. ACM-style problems.

First they organized a test of online puzzle. After completing it, they contacted after about 1-2 weeks and set up the interview time. The first interview was over phone and asked me about basic things like what I've worked on and which technologies I am familiar with. The second interview (also over phone) was a technical interview and I was given a problem to solve where the interviewer could also…  see me coding (via a screen sharing site). And as I was coding, he was asking me why I was doing them and suggested me to improve the algorithm.

The interview process is quite simple, firstly, the interviewer and me introduced each other. Then, I get a programming question to solve.

I had an initial informal interview with the campus recruiter who got me a technical phone interview. The technical interview was on the phone, was 45 minutes long, and consisted of two programming questions that were relatively easy. The recruiter was pretty friendly, and the interviewer was pretty cordial. I felt confident about the interview, but I was told I wasn't a good fit.

The interviewers were very nice - couldn't understand what one interviewer was saying, but he wrote the tasks and it was ok in the end. Had planned 3 technical interviews in total, failed the last one. The recruiters were extremely nice and prompt. Will definitely apply next year, all the interviewers seemed to be energetic and enthusiastic about their work - sound like the team I want to be part…  of and definitely worth the struggle.

Facebook visited my university. We had a 45 min test and some of us were invited for 1:1 interview next day.After that interview, recruiter contacted me like 2-3 weeks later and arranged phone interview.Interviewers were very friendly. At the start they told me something about what they are working on, they gave me a small programming challenge. Interviewer wanted to know about my ideas for solving the problem and gave…  small hints if I got stuck.

3 phone interviews. The first two was pretty good. The third interviewer is rude and has strong accent.

After I sent in a resume, they called me. I first talked to a kind women in HR, who approved me for two technical interviews. The first went rather poorly (or so I thought), but the interviewer was kind enough to help when I had a minor issue. The second will occur soon.

I had two technical interviews, both on the phone since I live in Europe and all of Facebook's development is done in the U.S. They talk to you on the phone while asking questions, then you code in an online text editor of which they can see the results live as well.They're very reasonable during these interviews: when you didn't quite get a question, they'll happily explain it better, if…  your answer is good but not quite there, they'll point you in the direction they want to hear more details about, and so on.

First the interviewer have called me on time, he introduced himself and his project which takes about 10 minutes, then he asked me why do you want to join facebook..Then he started in the technical questions, the first questions was:he described to me a game called othelo (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) which is a 2 player board game using for example X and O, if player X placed X in an empty space_OOOXthe…  O's between the two X's will be converted to XXOOOX ==> XXXXXthis will happen on the current row, column, and the two diagonals in every directionsand if the following case happened__OOXand the X player placed X in the first spaceX_OOXnothing occured for the two Osgiven a certain state of the board, location on the board, a certain pieceto place on the given locationupdate the board, and make the required validationsThen I started to code the required method, then have revised it and fixed small bugs, then he told me that it seems to be working.then we turned to the second question:which is given a Collection<String> words, return a Collection<String> of anagrams found in the given collection for example "The rat fell in the tar" => returned [rat tar]Then I have discussed him in an algorithm with O(n k lg k) where n is the number of words and k is the average length of the word, then I started to code it and then he said that it seems to be working.then the interview is finished.Notes:* Try to practice a lot before the interview, by solving such problems and try to mimic the interview environment by coding in the collabedit.com text editor* Don't use Ctrl + S while coding in collabedit as it may lead to some problems.* Don't be afraid before the interview, just calm down as the interviewers are very friendly.Good Luck :)

First I applied online. heard back from HR recruiter in about 2 weeks. She called and chatted about the interview process for 15 minutes. Then she scheduled a phone interview with an engineer. The interviewer was mostly silent and it was little hard to understand him because of little hiccups in the phone line. At first he talked about previous experience, my interests, his work and why facebook. After that…  he asked to code for 2 questions. implement strstr. and given a list of strings, find all the lists of anagrams present.

I dropped my resume off at a career fair and applied online through my university's career center. Got invited to an interview. My interviewer was a a current software engineer at Facebook and told me a little bit about his work and team, and then dove right in to the technical questions. We were short on time so after one technical Q he asked if I had any questions.

Two phone interviews. Was contacted by recruter.

**************************************Management**************************************
Pretty straightforward. During interview, it became clear another job was a better match, but they subsequently filled that position internally.

**************************************Summer Software Development Engineer In Test Intern**************************************
very simple question. ask you to reverse a linked list. so it was 1-2-3-4-5 initially then you need to reverse it to 5-4-3-2-1

**************************************Asset Manager**************************************
It was very simple. Asked basic questions about the what Facebook is all about and what their major product is. 2nd round phone interview consisted of going through scenarios:

**************************************Business Operations Intern**************************************
Recruiter contacted me to set up an interview a week after I submitted my resume online.Then I had one in-person interview with my future supervisor because I was in the area. Otherwise, it would have been a phone interview.A month or two later, I had one follow-up phone call from a person whom I would not work with but who also did data analytics.

**************************************Strategic Sourcing Manager**************************************
First a phone screening with the manager. Then an onsite panel interview with 4 members of the team, including the phone screener. The manager was the last interviewer and I heard a positive response about 4 days later

**************************************Software Developer Intern**************************************
One phone screen, one onsite interview

**************************************Fraud Operations**************************************
I submitted an online application and I was asked to complete a timed writing sample about a month later. A few weeks later I was contacted to do a phone interview which consisted of basic HR questions. I have not recieved any further feedback.

**************************************Site Reliability Engineer**************************************
First off, no NDA at any point in my process. Likely if you have an on-site.Very professional written message reach-out due to LinkedIn profile.Initial phone eval upon reply.Referral to a sales-person-type internal recruiter, and secondary eval.Coding interview. (I did exceptionally well.)Almost flown in for an in-person, but easily agreed to a "make sure" systems test. I'd been in a highly developer centric role for a while.Bombed the systems interview hard.…  Rather than a disjoint story, with the sections below, I'll lay it out here: vmstat, and only vmstat. Oh, you're rusty on vmstat? Explain vmstat to me for half an hour. European accent. Speakerphone.Half-assed "effort" to "shop me out" to some software development team by internal sales guy.Long time no hear.For as well reviewed as the company is I don't think that my experience is the case for well over 90% of applicants, but I honestly did fail the systems test as it was given. Holy something offensive was that a terrible test, but I failed it.

I was initially contacted by Facebook via a LinkedIn message. They found my resume online and thought I would be a good fit for their Site Reliability Engineer position. They asked if the position interested me, and I said that it did. They scheduled a phone interview for a week later.The phone interview consisted of some technical questions, and I had mixed results on those. I did not feel that…  I did my best, especially since I don't particularly enjoy coding in front of someone without any reference material. However, I was informed a few days later that they would like a second phone interview with me.I was surprised, and I accepted the next step in the process. Later the same day, they contacted me again to say they would rather bring me in for an onsite interview immediately instead of going through the second phone interview. I was surprised, but I accepted the offer and set up the travel dates shortly thereafter.On the morning of the interview, I underestimated the amount of time required to drive from Palo Alto to Menlo Park at 9:30am, and I arrived 5 minutes late to the interview. That was a terrible way to start the day, and I wondered if that would knock me out of the running immediately. Coming from rural NH, I was not used to heavy commuting traffic, but it was still inexcusable, and I felt defensive and angry at myself the rest of the day - not a great way to enter an interview with any company, let alone Facebook!Most of the interviews went reasonably well - programming aptitude, manager interview, etc. Two of the interviews went less well - networking knowledge and most pointedly, system architecture. The system architecture interviewer was somewhat unfriendly, but perhaps not on purpose if it was his true personality, and the interview included a "shadow" interviewer who didn't ask questions and only participated minimally.I had my most difficulty with this interview and did not do well with the "what if?" questions in general. I was disappointed with myself because I have thought of myself as someone who can design systems, but perhaps not at the scale that Facebook is looking for. At any rate, I was struggling with one question during the interview and said something like "Well, you could do....". I know that was a bad answer and wishy-washy, but the interviewer turned to his "shadow" with a wry smile and said in a sidebar "Well, of course you could do ....". I thought that was unprofessional and disrespectful, but tried to soldier on as best as I could. At the end of that interview, I could tell that I was not prepared well enough for it and felt that I had performed poorly on that one.I sent thank you emails to as many of the folks as I could, but when I could not find email addresses for some of them, I asked the recruiter for the rest of the addresses. Surprisingly, she replied that she "couldn't reveal personal email addresses at the company." I found that to be very strange, since some Facebook employee email addresses are found easily by Googling their names. She requested that I forward my thank you emails to her for each person and she would resend them internally. Again, I found that to be a strange request, but I complied. I did not receive any confirmation of receipt from her nor from the folks that I attempted to thank, but at that point, I was convinced that it didn't matter anyway.I was told that I would hear back from them by the following Friday, but that day came and went with no contact. Finally, I received a call from the recruiter the next week, and I was told that they were no longer interested due to my difficulties with the networking and system architecture interviews.I take responsibility for arriving late to the interview and do not plan on letting that happen for any future interviews. I'll never know if that had something to do with the negative response from them, but it certainly didn't help my chances! I was disappointed with some of the employee interactions, but I guess I'll just chalk that up to having a thin skin that day and being on the defensive because I had already messed up by arriving late.

**************************************Manager, Safety Operations**************************************
I applied through my college placement cell and got a interview call for a fairly senior role.They scheduled one round of telephonic interview which seemed to be just a formality. The interviewer started off by introducing herself but she was speaking very fast from memorized lines trying to get over with the interview as soon as possible. It was comical to say the least.She then would ask a question and…  I would then speak for 2-3 minutes answering the question but when I would finish there would be silence. I asked her if she was able to hear properly and she replied she could but she had put me on mute as she was speaking to someone else!This happened at least 2-3 times during the interview. She then ended the interview with some memorized lines speaking as fast as possible.The HR never got back to me for any feedback despite a reminder.

**************************************Production Engineering**************************************
The most impressed I have ever been with the interview process! All employees with whom I interacted were friendly, positive, and had the process down to an art. The technical interviews I had seemed to be more focused on discovering what I could do rather than exposing my flaws, which I feel is something the majority of other tech giants are focused on. Both interviewers made a really strong effort…  to encourage staying calm and having fun solving the questions. I had a phone screen and two technical interviews. I've heard that some interns do get an additional onsite interview after this. The questions were focused on testing my linux skills and quickly solving small-scale problems, so you really need to know your linux and scripting foundations.

One phone screen and two technical phone interviews. The phone screen had some basic questions about networking and systems. The first technical interview was a basic text processing question suitable for any scripting language, and the second was more of a systems design question that tested technical depth and troubleshooting. There was no coding involved on the second interview.

**************************************Recruitment**************************************
The interviewer was 10-15 minutes late which didn't get the interview off to a great start. The interview was basic but when I asked questions regarding the company's vision, the recruiter was unable / unwilling to give me an answer. This made the call very awkward and I was made to feel like I'd asked a stupid question. I ultimately didn't hear back from the recruiter and was then approached…  a few months later for another job at Facebook by the same recruiter. The overall candidate experience was awful and I don't think it's acceptable to not provide feedback when a candidate takes time off / out of their days to interview.

**************************************Events Manager**************************************
I went through 2 phone interviews and final stage at their offices in Covent Garden. Planning and communication was good, some small delay but hte overall experience was positive.The team I met was very nice and thorough good overall experience, nice offices and "cool" atmosphere.

**************************************TPM for Internet Org**************************************
Well, i have been interviewing with Facebook for internet.org team since 4 months now and still counting. I was called to Facebook HQ for loop interviews.All the feedback have been positive. I was quite excited to be a part of Facebook but HR team is so rude that they left me Inbetween the hiring process after almost 9 interviews because i was following up on my application status and candidature…  update.I have a very negative perception of Facebook now.

**************************************Web Applications Intern**************************************
Interviewer was friendly and told me ahead of time that she was going to ask me technical questions about the position. She was also flexible with when the interview was going to be held. I didn't really know what the position consisted of, but she asked general questions. The phone interview began with technical questions. One about databases and SQL and one about HTML.

**************************************Entry-level Technical Writer**************************************
The people at FB that I met were confused about this particular role and its purpose, function, etc. Had 5 interviews, first three went well, at the beginning of the fourth was told the job-for which I had been interviewing-had changed, and that the proceedings will focus on this "new job"-a position for which I did not apply. Questions and answers ensued around something that I would never have applied…  in the first place. Long story short. Got a "thanks-but-no thanks" email two weeks later from a job I did not apply. I wrote a letter to the recruiter regarding the matter, she apologized and promised to look into why FB decided to change jobs half way through the process.

**************************************SMB**************************************
Questions included wanting to know about how I would interact with small business owners, how I stay organized (method), and how I get through a lot of work and prioritize tasks. I did the interview over the phone, and the interviewer was nice and asked good questions. I was not very suitable for the position, and did not have any business or tech experience so I was not surprised that…  I did not get a follow up interview. I did a lot of research about the role, and I recommend anyone applying to do the same. They will want to hear anecdotes and numbers.

**************************************Software Engineer/Research Scientist**************************************
I met one FB recruiter at a conference and then set up the first phone interview two weeks after. The first question is write an algorithm such that if an element in a M*N matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0. The second question is BFSI get an email one week later telling me I passed the first interview and ready to set up a…  second phone interview. Then I waited for a month until I finally got a reply. In the second interview, the first part is mainly based on my current published paper. The second part is a coding problem related to find combinations of a sequence of numbers, which are produced by a six-side dice.

**************************************Merchant Services Manager**************************************
The recruiter was very knowledgeable of the position and asked intelligent questions and follow-up questions. The hiring manager asked tougher questions and asked how I would solve an existing problem. Overall, I thought the phone screen was one of the better phone screening interviews. Unfortunately it seemed as if the hiring manager was waiting in an airport and was too rushed to have an interview at that time.

**************************************Internship - Global Communications and Policy**************************************
A short phone interview in which the recruiter asked me questions regarding my most current job experience and questions then let me have a few minutes to ask her questions.1.) What would your current boss say if I asked him why I should hire you?2.) What is a recent project you are really proud of?

**************************************Site Operations**************************************
The interview started with a phone screen. After that, I was scheduled with a recruiter. Two more interviews later, I was scheduled for an on-site interview. Once there, I went through a string of interviews after a short tour.Overall, the experience was incredible. The recruiter took quite a bit of time to prep me for the process and was always available to answer any questions. They understood that I had…  to work the interviews around my current work schedule, and were accommodating to that end. Everyone really seemed to understand that nerves come into play during interviews, and they all did their best to alleviate any discomfort and stress.The people asked some great questions and gave me ample time to ask my own questions. Every single person seemed to know how to do their job well and exuded a sense of confidence. With each interview, I felt like they wanted to know me as a professional and wanted to see how I would fit in with their team. At no point did I feel like any question was a pass/fail situation.Facebook is, of course, a technology company. There were some technical questions, and some of them were rather intense. You knew the answers or how to reason them out, or you didn't. I missed a couple of questions, and I do not feel that those missed questions negatively impacted me. Most of the interviewers said that they would prefer for the interview to be in conversation format. In every case, that's exactly what happened.I realized in the last couple of interviews that the position I interviewed for may not be the right fit for me. It seems Facebook agreed as they did not move forward after the on-site interview. They gave me a call after about a week and let me know what they liked and gave me the opportunity to ask any final questions.I still want to work for Facebook. The energy and passion is obvious as you walk around the campus, and I want to be a part of that. I wanted to be a part of their team before the interviews, but the interview process really solidified my interest. I'll be watching for a position that may be a better fit and apply again. Hopefully soon!

**************************************Solutions Engineer**************************************
Applied Online for this position. Got an interview the next day. The hiring process involves 2 phone interviews. You have to solve one coding question in the first interview and two coding questions in the second one. Once you clear them, you go onsite for five rounds of interviews. You are required to complete an app assignment which you will demo at your onsite interview. You will also be required…  to code live to add a feature to the app during the demo. Onsite interview schedule is App demo + technical presentation on any topic + 2 coding interviews + 1 marketing interview. You will have a higher chance of getting the offer if you do the app demo well. They expect a lot in that.

I applied online through Facebook career site. Recruiter contacted me for Coding/phone interview. Interview was about 45 mins. They go through about the company and the position and asked about my background and then asked me Coding question which I did well. Next day I received an email again from recruiter for second phone interview after a week. 2nd phone interview held by one of the Solution Engineer team member.…  Interview again was 45 mins. He asked me about my background followed by 2 coding question.Overall Interview process is good so far.Waiting for their reply after 2nd interview.

A friend referred me for SWE, but instead I got contacted for Solutions Engineer. The process was 1. recruiter phone screen + coding challenge 2. phone screen with a Solutions Engineer 3. Onsite.The interviews mostly consisted of a lot of behavioral and questions about your past experience. In addition to that, they also gave coding problems which were not too hard

A recruiter set up a telephone interview with me after submitting my resume. That was a blazingly fast response. The first part of the interview took about 30 minutes. She walked me through the requirements of the position and asked me I had any questions at the end. I was given fifteen minutes to complete a coding challenge, while she monitored my code on a collaborative editor. One day after…  the interview, she got back to me and said I did not make for the second round of the interview, after my code went through a review process by the Facebook technical team.

The recruiter described the solutions engineer role and asked me about my experience. The role is really about talking to people who buy facebook ads and optimizing their experience. She asked me about my experiences that would help me in this role

I was contacted by a recruiter the day after I submitted my resume online. I was as accommodating as possible, finding a quick break between meetings to speak with her about the position. Overall, that conversation went well but I was winding down from a high pressure meeting so I was definitely a bit loquacious. We scheduled a phone interview to follow two days later.During that time, I talked a…  bit with my mother about how relocation would affect my ability to help with a recent loss in my immediate family. I emailed the recruiter and scheduler, alerting them I didn't think I'd be able to relocate for some time, and I understood if they wanted to cancel the interview, but I'd hold the time on my calendar until hearing from them.I received a reply after the interview time, only after mentioning "Glassdoor". So I instead spent the interview time writing this review.Challenging work is great, being part of innovation is amazing, but as a successful professional with experience in both, I can't emphasize enough how important it is you find somewhere to work that treats people the way you'd hope to be treated in opposite shoes. This is the same way they'll treat you as innovation changes things... who knows...in a more connected/augmented reality based world what relevance a profile would even have?If I could look back I would apply this same principle to how I made friends, love interests, and how I have chosen jobs. There will always be more money to be made. There will always be smart people to work with. There will always be exciting/innovating things to be part of. But this isn't like surfing waves where you just catch another one...being part of something will change who you are/how you act/who you become.In short, don't sell your soul to hang out with this year (or decades) cool kids.

Was contacted by a recruiter via Linkedin and offered to apply for the position which required a relocation from my country. Had an HR interview over the phone, then a technical interview over Skype and a shared text editor, then they flew me over to the final interviews on-site.2 of the on-site interviews were purely technical, 1 background/personality interview, "unofficial" lunch with a team member, and a business/product interview with…  the team leader and a team member.I was expected to be familiar with Facebook's business products in detail - which tools exist, how do they work, API calls etc.

**************************************Customer Service Representative**************************************

**************************************Analyst, User Operation**************************************
Applied for analyst user operation position online. I got an email from a recruiter and was asked to do a 1-hour test consisting of three questions. Two questions have to be answered in the language I applied for. Questions aren't that hard. I'm still waiting for further response.

Submitted resume - heard back 8 months later (took on another job in tech in-between)3 phone screens.1 w/recruiter2 w/ppl in the SMB roleFly you into Austin and put you up in the nicest hotel and go through a series of in-person interviews (4-5 30 min)Had to sign NDA but the interview consisted of knowledge based questions on Facebook for Business marketing/advertising solutions and the manager asked more down-to-earth philosophical questions.…  Everyone was super cool.

Got referred by a friend and was asked for a phone interview within a week. It moved very quick, the HR provided me with a list of links and questions that I should be prepared for.

I started out by doing an informational phone interview, then a second phone interview with a manager. They gave me an at-home research assignment to simulate some of the work done by the SMB team. Afterwards, I got called into the office for a series of interviews over the course of a couple hours. I did a total of four 30 min interviews with members of the SMB account team.…  Afterwards I got a call a few days later letting me know they made a decision.

The interview process was long, but very transparent.I had about three screening calls with various questions about my motivation, my background and some case questions.I was then invited to the Dublin office, where I had several interviews with different people. What I loved about it was that the interviewers were so transparent, and everything was very well planned according to scheduale.In between me and the interviewers where there no objects…  such as a table or anything that created a "split" between me and them, which contributed to a very relaxed environment that calmed me down a lot.We got to eat with some of the employees, and then it was over.

Applied for the position as an SMB account manager (DACH) at Facebook, Dublin HQ.Received an email asking me to provide dates (over the next two weeks) for a call. After those two weeks, she contacted me apologizing for the delay and asking for more options. Now a month later, no response to my email or follow-ups on the application process.So basically no one ever contacted me to confirm the 20…  minutes call or to tell me that I am not considered for the position anymore.

The process was approx. a month including 2 phone-interviews with my recruiter, 1 interview w. a team manager for the role and 3 onsite interviews including a mock call and an agency pitch.The whole process was pleasant, and the interviewers was really nice, but also tricky though. They asked many specific questions about how I would handle certain situations, where the future is for the industry etc.

Uploaded my CV online, and got an email two weeks later that they'd like to talk to me on the phone to discuss my possibilities within Facebook. Scheduled a thirty minute phone interview the next week and talked to them for thirty minutes. Mostly questions about my past employment, which courses I was currently taking that were relevant and most importantly "why Facebook". I didn't get further but it was…  an overall good experience with a good level of personal support for such a large company.

After applying and sending my CV through Facebook website, I had 2 phone interviews - first with the recruiter, then with the SMB team manager. The recruiter was very helpful, giving feedback after each of the interviews and helping prepare for the next one. Then I got invited to Dublin for an on-site interview at Facebook office, where I was interviewed by three people in the space of 1.5 hour…  - team manager, marketing manager and SMB director. The first two were very nice, while the director seemed rather unpleasant and absent-minded, but maybe that was his interview strategy. The whole process was very nice and clear, but I did not get the job, as I did not have enough sales experience.

**************************************Customer Service**************************************
I found out Facebook was hiring at a university career fair. I submitted my resume and was selected for a 1v1 interview. Then they flew me out to their offices in Austin for another interview. I interviewed with 3 people in a row (who came in the room while i sat there). 2 of the people were nice and straightforward but one older man asked for a lot of very…  specific stories from my past. It was a lot of "Tell me a time...." all wanting me to tell stories about working with others.

**************************************Software Engineer New Grad**************************************
The recruiter contacted me 4 days after my friend has referred me. Then the recruiter asked me to offer some available times to arrange a phone interview. I asked a rearrangement and the recruiter responded quickly. The phone interviewer was very nice.

I participated in a 45 minute on campus interview, then had an onsite interview in Menlo Park for Facebook University Day. There were 3 separate interviews on University Day; one personality & background interview, and 2 problem solving/whiteboard coding interviews.

I was recruited, interviewed and screened, no offer. The questions were deceivingly simple. I'm not a classroom taught coder, so maybe I just didn't have the algorithm knowledge needed. Everyone was very nice and friendly, and I enjoyed all of my interactions though. I think it's hard to get your foot in the door and there are so many qualified individuals. Alas, Facebook is not for me I suppose.

Phone screen interview. 2 weeks after I was contacted by the recruiter.A brief introduction followed by coding question on coderpad. No need to complie.First, describe yourself. Why do u fit for this role.Coding question combinational sum.Follow up by time complexity and optimization solution.Ended with QA.

I had my resume submitted by a Facebook employee and i immediately got an email to schedule a technical interview. I scheduled it 2 weeks in advance because I had a Google interview scheduled for the following week. The interview questions were easy and I was able to answer them on time and had about 10 minutes at the end of the interview to chat with the interviewer. He was…  pleasant and we chatted about Facebook, the culture and the technology.At the end of the interview, he said he was pleased with my responses and he will submit his feedback to the recruiter who will let me know what the next steps were.I was taken aback when 8 days later, I got an email from the recruiter saying they were going to move forward with other candidates. I did not get any feedback whatsoever. I am still trying to figure out where I went wrong!

I turned in my résumé at a University hiring event and heard back within a week. A phone call was set up for the end of the week. It was meant to be a 45 min phone call but ran another 15 mins. I felt like they paired me with someone that was out of the scope of my prior experience. They are really looking for someone to hop onto…  on stack.

First round interview: Interviewed face to face at the University.Some general questions like why do I want to work at Facebook. Then I was asked 2 questions. One was a Fibonacci series and the other one was about an array with some special properties (I can't recall but I think it had some random zeroes interpolated). I stumbled on the second question which is why I guess didn't move forward.

Was contacted by a recruiter after submitting my resume. Set up a time to talk. Asked a few Algo, Data Structure and C++ questions. Was contacted again regarding a phone technical interview. Had a 45 mins interview where I was asked to code in collabedit.

**************************************Small Business Account Manager**************************************
The interview process consisted of individual interviews with several account managers, a team work, and activities to encourage socialisation among candidates as well as a deeper knowledge of the company and understanding of Facebook's culture.

**************************************Business Operations Associate**************************************
Campus recruiting, applied online.3 steps:1) Phone screen by recruiter - about 30 mins with the usual questions such as "Why Facebook, why this role", review of past experience/projects/research.2) Phone interview with a manager - about 40 mins, focusing on some product type questions (recommend a new feature on an existing FB product, how would you assess how popular the feature was). Don't recall any statistics/probability questions, or consulting case interview…  type questions.3) Onsite interview - about five 30 min interviews back-to-back. Each interview focused on different things: SQL (basic problem, code on whiteboard), product metrics and experiment design (how would you evaluate if a change to a feature was positive), past experience/projects (why did you choose this approach vs. another approach), estimation questions (how would you estimate the number of FB users who will use a new pdt x).Whole process from start to finish was about 1 month.

A recruiter contacted me to set up an interview for a Business Operations Associate. I spoke with the hiring manager who basically turned our interview into an informational interview. I felt it was a waste of both our times since I never had a chance to speak about myself.

**************************************SEC Reporting Analyst**************************************
Hiring process began with a discussion with the recruiting team. Once I passed that round, I had a phone interview with the manager for the position. As this was during quarter end, the process was put on hold. A few months later, I was contacted again by the recruiting team. They wanted to bring me out to CA for an interview. As an out of state candidate, I completed first…  and second round interviews in one day. Upon arrival, I took a computer "test". I was asked to review the financials of a fictional company and correct as many errors as I could find. The recruiter sat in a small room with me while I completed this task. They provided a tiny IBM computer on an end table. Very awkward experience but not hard. I then had a series of 5 1/2 hour interviews with everyone from General Counsel to the Controller. This was followed by lunch and a tour of campus. I had a new recruiter and she was extremely uncomfortable. I ended the day with another conversation with the manager for the position.

**************************************Escalations Specialist, Community Operations (French)**************************************
I was first contacted by a recruiter over e-mail, then we had a phone call to discuss my past experience, my interest in the role. I had the chance to discover more about the team and I was very pleased by the kindness of the recruiter.I then moved to a second stage, a video interview with a team member in language (French) over BlueJeans (similar to Skype). What can I…  say? I did several interviews for tech companies and this was the worst experience I ever had. The interviewer seemed to be upset, she was very cold, unfriendly, overall she seemed very pissed off to be there.I did not like few things in her behavior:1) after I talked about my current job she commented out of the blue that my job was very "variegated" - I still need to understand if it was a negative or positive comment, but the first thing an interviewer shouldn't do is to add useless comments during an interview.2) I did not know if she was taking notes or just writing to other people, she did not bother telling me what she was doing on her computer3) When I asked her a question about the team (I asked her to tell me how a day in the role of Escalation Specialist looks like) she just answered "I don't understand what you mean". This put extra pressure on me, I had to rephrase the question and she just answered that "every day it's different in this role". She did not show any excitement for her role, no passion at all, she was just very cold, and above all she didn't answer my question.I was 100% sure that she would reject me and this happened after 2 weeks. I was relieved not to proceed further, I would not enjoy working in an environment where this is the atmosphere. Also, funny thing, the recruiter sent me an automatic e-mail to inform me that I was rejected, and few minutes later she sent me another e-mail with the same content but with that was meant for someone else. Negatively impressed overall, I would not recommend to interview for this team (or company, if this is generalized).

**************************************Security Engineering, Foundation Security**************************************
I applied to this job through the website. Had a phone screen several weeks later and had on-site interview consisting of two technical interviews plus lunch. Although I received an email several days after the onsite saying that they moved with another candidate, overall the interview process was very fun and makes me love Facebook, especially when I got a chance to visit the HQ. Interviews were not terribly hard,…  but I was asked a wide range of security-related questions (such as DNS, PKI, secure system design etc.)

**************************************Community Operation (Arabic)**************************************
The job was mainly to be responsible on the reports that Facebook gets for the region that I will be covering (MiddleEast - Arabian Peninsula).I applied online, then I got an email after few hours and asked to finish an online assessment. The assessment was divided into two parts. The first part was mainly IQ questions, and the second part was an essay question. The answer of the essay should…  be written in the language you applied for (Arabic in my case).After couple of days, the recruiter contacted me for screening interview. The recruiter was nice. The question were mainly general. She explained the position what I will be doing if I get accepted. The question were the usual 'Talk about yourself' and other questions from your CV. Know your resume very well. Be careful with the dates that you are providing. After the interview I got another email from her in approximately a day, she scheduled an interview with a teammate that I will possibly work with in the future. She gave all the support necessary for the interview. She even gave me a list of possible questions that I should expect during the interview. I studied very hard for those questions. I surfed Glassdoor for previous interviews, and believe me it helped. After couple of days, I got an email to schedule another phone interview. I got the call from the potional teammate. The interview held in the language I applied for (in my case it was Arabic). The questions were specific about Facebook this time. For example: what are the main policies that Facebook have.You need to study everything about Facebook. (Products, watch old conferences, policies... etc).

**************************************Software Engineer - IOS**************************************
Consisted of an initial phone screen with a recruiter, a couple of basic theory questions about iOS were asked at the end of the interview. Afterwards, I had two technical phone interviews and a final round of 4 interviews onsite. Had a very good experience, everybody was very nice.

**************************************Software Engineer (Intern)**************************************
First interview was a simple resume checker. Then two interviews with a software engineer with live online coding problems.

**************************************Data Engineer**************************************
I got the call via employee referral. HR contacted me through phone for initial screening. General interview like my background and interest. Then a few weeks later, SQL Coding and Python Coding rounds was conducted. Each coding round were of 45 minutes each back to back with 15 minutes break. The coding was conducted on coder pad. I was able complete the 5 SQL coding questions but could only complete…  1 Python coding question. I found the python questions difficult.

Two technical interviews on me and both came from managers. First round was on SQL and everything was straight forward. The interviewer was highly professional and he also introduced what his team was doing. Second round was focused on algorithm and codings and the interviewer with strong accent seemed inpatient and unwilling to explain the question. He told me to look at the test cases to figure out myself. I…  was told the SQL part was fine but the coding part was not positive.

I interviewed with the Business Intelligence team. The process involved one phone interview (coding + SQL) followed by 4 rounds of interviews at onsite.Phone interview was easy with medium level SQL and coding questions. The interviewer stressed a lot on running times for the coding questions. I had to offer three different solutions and implement the optimal version of the code.At onsite, there was one SQL interview, followed by 2…  coding interviews. After lunch, a manager conducted an ETL design and metrics interview.The interviewer, who asked me the map-reduce question was doing some work on his laptop. He hardly paid any attention to the code I was writing on the wall. I had to try hard to get his attention to my code and explain how it works.The best part of the interview was meeting Guy Bayes, the Data Engineering Director at Facebook. He is such a cool people manager. Instead of interviewing me in the interview room, he took me out for a walk along side the bay next to Facebook's office in MenloPark. He is so awesome.Guy Bayes is one reason why you should consider joining Facebook.All the best for your interviews.

1) Recruiter reached out via LinkedIn, 2) Initial chat with recruiter, 3) Two phone interviews - one focused on SQL, one focused on coding, 4) Onsite interviews - three full-stack case interviews, one behavioral lunch interviewThe entire process was very well-coordinated, and everyone I met was very nice and professional. The onsite case interviews were full-stack and tested your product sense, data modeling/warehousing knowledge, SQL, and general coding. It focused…  more on breadth than width.

A recruiter reached on linkedin and set up an initial call to discuss about background.Next was two phone screens - 1) SQL 2) Any preferred language (I picked Python)Each phone screen is 45 minutes and you are asked about 6-7 questions. The questions are relatively straightforward if you are comfortable with basics.In coding interview, they are trying to see if you can approach the same program in two different ways…  - one using inbuilt methods and one without using in built methods

Its a Skype interview. One hour. He asked me to query a scenario in a special window. I was asked to write complex SQL query. I realized that i'm being rejected half way the process. Never the less, the interviewer was very patient.

The interview process was pretty streamlined. First, I received an email from the HR asking for an informal discussion. After I set up a time, we had almost a 50 minutes discussion about what I have worked in past and what are my skill sets. Also, the HR explained me about the job profile in detail. After a couple of weeks, the HR confirmed to me about the telephonic rounds.…  There were two back to back telephonic rounds, coding followed by an SQL round.For the first round, I was called around 5 minutes late for the interview. The interviewer asked me about my previous work experience and then asked to start coding. The questions were pretty simple and I could answer all of them. There was one that required little thinking but I eventually solved it. I already had my next round of interview scheduled so the interviewer said that he could not ask me further questions. It was a very abrupt end to my interview although I solved all the questions.The second round was on SQL queries and this was really easy to crack. The queries were complex but I knew the concept and so could form them correctly. Only the last question asked for little complex related to cross join. I managed to answer but could not get the correct answer. This interview lasted longer than 45 minutes. The interviewer was very friendly and communicated very professionally.After both the rounds, I was very confident that I had cracked the interview as I could solve all the questions asked. But unfortunately, I got an email after a week saying that I have not cleared the round. This was very surprising to me as I kept wondering where I went wrong. I asked the recruiter about a feedback but she refused to give any. I don't know if it's their mistake or what but I still wonder what went wrong.

Got the first round phone interview. The recruitment HR was really sweet. Sent me the details of what to expect and asked me to schedule a date for interviews in a few days. Scheduled it a week later. There were 2 rounds of interview and both the interviewers were really nice.I was not satisfied with the process though. The second HR who scheduled my interview sent me a tentative time…  in the evening, however, on the day of the interview I got a mail that the interview is in an hour and it was supposed to be a.m. and not p.m. The interviewers did not have my phone number or resume, fortunately we were logged in into a shared coding platform from where we exchanged numbers. Also, the position advertised a heavy dependency on SQL and data modeling, and also the mail that the HR sent to me about what to expect stressed a lot on SQL and data modeling. However, I wasn't asked a single question about it but the interview rather focussed on only programming in python. When asked them about this, the reason was that SQL is easy to pick up and hence they don't stress much on it.

A recruiter reached out to me ,the interview process was very efficient,she explained the job I will be interviewing for in detail.Two people on the team were confirmed to interview me for the JobThe phone interview required me to code using a software.The SQL questions consisted of Group by,find the highest salary per department.The questions were easy but it required you to be good and know the basics.I didn't get…  to the next round unfortunately but I learnt a lot lot and I will prepare better for future interviews

Applied online and got first information call after 1 week.First technical phone screening involving first SQL screen and 2nd programming round back to back for 30 minutes each.Sql questions were avg- tough and same was the case with programming (they allow you to choose your preferred programming language to code).

The process started with my submission of a resume. Several months later, I was invited to a phone interview with a recruiter. After that, there was a 45 minute technical phone interview that covered a basic palindrome detection coding exercise that I solved in Python. Several days afterwards, I was invited to a second 45 minute phone interview that focused on performing a merge-sort with pure SQL. Finally, I was…  invited to fly out to Menlo Park and interview on-site for an interview loop.The phone interviews went relatively smoothly, both interviewers were incredibly kind and professional. The on-site interview was an amazing experience, but was a night and day difference from the difficulty of the phone interviews. Although substantial in subject, each interviewer was again kind and professional and I got the honest feeling they wanted me to succeed.It was the first interview I've ever had where I didn't feel attacked interrogated and felt at complete ease. Facebook has done a wonderful job at cultivating a supportive and encouraging culture which shone through during the entire interview process.That all said, my best advice for those interview is to not let the colloquial atmosphere lull you into a sense of ease. While the interviews are warm and helpful, their ultimate goal was to choose prime candidates. Be yourself, be honest, but never "let your guard down" and choose your words carefully. Every response is measured!Some technical notes on how to prepare (and consequently things I think I fell below the grade on!):1. Be able to effortlessly calculate Big O for any given algorithm.2. Be ready to use both built-in solutions for your chosen programming language and custom. For example, splitting a string by spaces "by hand" and using a built-in.3. Switch gears between iterative and recursive. It may not matter what is the most efficient route, but the interviewer may want to see if you're able to solve the problem with either approach.4. Ask for your boundaries. Can you use more than one technology? Can you offload some of the work to the DB? Can you use built-ins?5. Understand the fundamentals for everything you say. For example, know when to approach query optimization with an index and when to solve it with summary tables.6. Triple check with your Uber drive to make sure they know the right building to go to ;)

- Employee referral to Phone Screen- Phone Interview with web coding (algorithm + SQL) via coderpad.io- In-person Interview with data structure/algorithm coding, sql coding, a "lunch" that was essentially a compatibility interview, and then a full stack interview that was basically a combination of all three.

There were 2 Telephonic round(1 coding+1 sql)(45 mins each with a break of 15 mins in between)You will be asked to code. Interviews would start with basic introduction and they would ask you to code in your preferred language(but Python is preferred). sql questions are My sql based. Regular questions but answers expected are the most optimized way. They would expect simple questions to be answered in a particular way.

The interview process was long with a wait time of 2 weeks between each round. Started off with 2 initial screening rounds and then 6 45-minute on-site interviews. 4 of the 6 interviews were highly technical(SQL, R and Python). Didn't get an offer but overall a fair process and got to share knowledge with some very smart folks.

HR phone interview still in process, find the hiring manger in Linkedin and submit the application. General description on current job and the requirement of Facebook data engineer position. Then the HR says need to talk with hiring to valid my ability and decide whether go to next step

Recruiter approached via linkedin and requested for a 30 min chat about my current roles and responsibilities and what are their expectations and probable compensations and benefits. This was followed by back to back phone screens involving SQL and python coding exercise. The HR and the SQL interviewer were superb at their job.

Talked with a recruiter, and went to Palo Alto for an on campus technical interview. Took about 90 minutes doing whiteboard code and talking through some hypothetical experiments. Interviewer did not ask ANY questions about the type of work I currently do, projects I have done etc. Didn't seem interested in anything other than checking the boxes on the form. Seemed more like an interrogation than a conversation.

So i had 4 back to back interviews with all managers. The interviews were all extremely technical and the interviewers were pretty straight forward, weren't excessively nice or mean.The interview went through lunch hour and they din't offer me lunch and I was so hungry through half af all my interviews which kinda sucked.

Overall, Facebook's interview process was slow and uncoordinated.I was referred, but dealt with their internal recruiters throughout the process. After chatting with one of their recruiters, I was told they'd schedule an initial screening interview. Since I was local, this was done at their headquarters instead of over the phone. This screening was actually 3 one-on-one interviews and took over two hours. These were pretty basic questions, and none were…  too difficult.I passed the screen and went back for another round of one-on-one interviews. These questions were tougher. One was about scaling an app I'd written up to Facebook scale. Since I don't have a ton of experience working at scale, I don't know if I flubbed it or not. One was about processing log files of events to determine a user's current status. And one was about splitting strings up using a dictionary (search for "Retiring a Great Interview Problem" if you want the details) that I eventually worked though.After that, I was asked back to a third round of one-on-one interviews. I was told this one would be quick, but it was just as long as the others. Most of the questions were actually about work I'd done previously and data visualization.After this, I received a call from a recruiter who sounded excited, saying they were going to do a background check on me, and that I should expect to hear back when the hiring manager returned from vacation. But that time came and went, and I was eventually told (via email) that the position had been filled, so I didn't get an offer.I'd like to draw special attention to how slow this process was. After my initial contact with a recruiter, it took 2 weeks to schedule and do the screening interview. It took another 2 weeks for them to get feedback and schedule a second round. After the second round, it look another 3 weeks to get the third round scheduled. And then it was another 2 weeks before I heard back. I had nearly wide-open availability, so the only thing holding things up was Facebook.I'd also like to draw attention to how uncoordinated the recruiters were. My initial contact was with one recruiter. After chatting with him, he handed me off to a second recruiter. She scheduled the second interview, after which i was handed off to a third recruiter. And after that, the email saying the position had been filled came from a fourth recruiter. Meanwhile, the recruiters that scheduled the interviews helped escort me around on site were different than any of these. It was very, very difficult to keep track of who to contact with questions, updates, and thank yous. I also think the job title of I was applying for changed at least once during this process, which led to a little confusion in the actual interviews, though all recruiters involved assured me it was the same position.More uncoordination: they asked me to fill out an application form, and I did so and turned it in at my screening interview. They then asked from this same form at every subsequent interview, and even once over email, and I had to keep reminding them I'd already done it.Also, just a gripe. All three of my on-site interviews were scheduled to begin in the morning, and they all lasted well past noon. I was only offered lunch once.

I have a phone interview at first. Before this, I asked the recruiter whether I cold apply to two positions. I was told not for now. Then, they arrange an phone chat for me.

HR Screening, then technical Phone interview, based on questions related to Python and SQL

The recruiters were really nice. They planned well through out the process and communicated so well during the process.But, the callous attitude of interviewers always bothers me. I was asked to show up around 10am and I reached the place 9.45am. But, the interviewer did not show up until 10.40am. No apologies and he did not even feel bad about it.He threw a training book and told me to solve…  a design/data modeling problem. He himself did not have clue about the answer and he was looking at the answer in the back of the book. He asked random question and manager asked one question thinking as he solved every problem in the earth. That totally put me off.

Technical recruiter contacted me for a phone interview, then we scheduled a meeting in Tel Aviv offices.45 minutes talk with head of analysts. talked about 20 min. about my background, and then asked a question.Don't know why I didn't pass, since the position was for data eng. and not an analyst.

I interviewed with Facebook position Data Engineer for Singapore office. The whole process took 4 weeks, mainly for waiting for the result. It took me 2.5 weeks just to receive the Thanks but no thanks email!Technical bar for this position is very low, questions are easy especially on SQL. However, they are looking for a person also can work with BI team so there are some requirements on the non-technical…  side, e.g product sense. Do prepare to be interviewed by "manager" people who doesnt asset based on technical skills but your manner and personality. I was quite surprised when one of them asked me why I have 8 years of experience but already worked for 7 companies. It is teally offensive and I couldnt believe a company like Facebook asked me that question!In general, it as a bad experience for me, especially the waiting part!

**************************************Data Warehouse Engineer**************************************
A recruiter contacted me via Linked asking me if I am interested. A phone interview with the recuriter was set up the next day. During the interview, several technical questions were asked which are quite fundamental. I was told getting into the next round immediately after the phone screening.A second phone interview was set up several days later with an Senior Engineer. During the interview, I was asked to code…  two question via http://collabedit.com/.Two days later I got rejection

**************************************Product Software Engineer**************************************
I was contacted by linkedin and thought it was a joke. I reply the message and started the process very fast and kindly. Every recruiter and interviewer was very kind and treat me with respect. I live in Argentina and made one online interview. After it the send me a ticket to Menlo Park and there i had another 4 interviews.

**************************************Finance Manager**************************************
Phone screen with recruiter followed by phone interview with hiring manager. The recruiter was mainly checking that I had performed all the tasks in the job req. The hiring manager asked a couple more detailed questions and answer some of my questions. This role sat in the FP&A world where Facebook has a strict 6 days close (including weekends).

I was initially hesitant about this role because the description seemed lateral with my current position. I applied online and recruiter called 2 months later then followed up with a phone screen from the hiring manager 2 months after that. The hiring manager was able to give me a little bit more detail about the role, but it seemed like they hadn’t really fleshed out the position yet. Invited for…  an on campus interview to meet 4 people for 45 minute rounds.. I followed up with the recruiter after this, who said that I was a “frontrunner” but they didn’t want to move forward with me until they had other candidates they liked (I didn’t even know how to respond to that).Fast forward 3 weeks later, when they said they were ready to move forward with final rounds as well as a web meeting with someone in another office. Final rounds were a little tougher with interviewers trying testing my technical skills. After it was over, the hiring manager stayed behind to tell me more about the role and seemingly wanting me to know that it wasn’t as lateral as I had thought and that there were plenty of opportunities for growth. She totally sold me on this position and I walked out convinced that this could be a good career move. I followed up with the recruiter after three weeks - given the other reviews here, it seems like during the final hour they have a tendency of dropping off the face of the earth. I reached out again to close the loop again after 3 weeks, thinking that if I hadn't heard back it was unlikely I got the offer. Finally heard back that the hiring manager didn't want to move forward with anyone in final rounds - overall, an incredibly frustrating process. If you aren't enthusiastic about me, why string someone along to keep pushing that this is a good position for them? Incredibly frustrating and unprofessional. I received a canned email from their HR group, without any feedback for why they were passing on everyone in general. So helpful guys, so helpful.

A recruiter reached out showing strong interest in my background/experiences. Started with a phone chat with recruiter. She shared more details about the job, asked about compensation etc which was followed by a phone interview with hiring manager for 45 mins. It went extremely well, had a good discussion about role, my background & experiences. After a week or so schedule for an onsite loop to meet seven individuals.On site…  interview experience was great, most of the people whom I met were very easy going. Had discussions about my current experiences, why Facebook, why this role, why want to leave current job, and knowledge about Facebook in general.Heard back after two weeks, that they would like me to come onsite to meet two executives and Hiring manager for the role in the final loop. I thought I had very engaging conversation with all of them but something went wrong as during the follow-up call Recruiter mentioned that they are going to move forward with an offer with another candidate and my skills doesn't seem to be inline with the requirements of the role.Overall it was a great experience. Recruiters are really professional and kept me posted about progress on each and every single stage. They even provided some inputs in terms of what to expect during interviews. The only thing which could have been better was being very specific about what they actually want in an ideal candidate but given this was a unique role, it is very difficult for them to outline exact requirements.I admire the company and individuals I met. Way to go Facebook!

**************************************Strategic Marketing**************************************
Terrible process, very unclear, had 4 HR points of contact and was given no overview of the actual role. When I came to the second interview with the manager he called me 15 minutes late and was in a hotel lobby it was extremely noisy, he seemed distracted and uninterested. I was told I would hear back in a week, I heard nothing, waited and waited heard nothing, so e-mailed…  after 3 weeks and nothing returned, e-mailed 2 weeks later and got an out of office that she had left. I then did not follow up. But terrible from the recruiters and really put me off them.

**************************************MySQL Operations Database Administrator**************************************
Erik, a recruiter from Facebook reached out to me on LinkedIn. Istarted out with two phone interviews. The first of which focusedspecficially on MySQL, the second involved scripting. Both lasted alittle less than an hour. In the second phone interview I used aweb-based shared text editor to show how I'd script up a common MySQLmonitoring tool in my favorite programming language.A week later I flew down for 5 face to…  face interviews. The first waswith Erik, the recruiter, who was friendly and took me to lunch at theFacebook cafeteria. Then I met with the team leader, who asked mesome technical MySQL questions, but was more focused on how I mightfit in with the team, and general working philosophy type questions.I then met with four other MySQL operations team members. Theirquestions focused on MySQL InnoDB scalability + performance issues.If you understand what most everything SHOW INNODB STATUS shows you'llbe in good shape. History length, purge thread, locks, deadlocks,insert buffer, durability options, etc. Understand storage hardware,iostat -x, RAID levels, write caching, etc.What I loved most about the interview process is that their questionswere focused on real MySQL problems that they deal with every day.There were no BS questions that are designed to "see how you think" orother such nonsense. I did not have to estimate how many golf ballsyou could fit inside a school bus, or speculate on why manhole coversare round.I did my homework for these interviews, and I thought I was wellserved by watching Domas and Mark Calahan's youtube videos about theMySQL challenges they face at Facebook.

The whole interview process is pleasant. Recruiter and interviewers are all friendly. It is a good company to work with.

**************************************Human Resources Business Partner**************************************
It was a long process, but it was due to the nature of the role - other than length, everything else was wonderful!Back in April, a recruiter reached out to me. I wasn't ready to interview at the time but we agreed to stay in touch, and when I became interested I let her know that I was available. As it happened, several roles were opening up, so I met…  with a couple of folks off site before coming in for two rounds of onsite interviews.Every interviewer was prepared, friendly, and whip-smart. The recruiting team was efficient and responsive.

**************************************Market Specialist, Community Operations**************************************
I was referred from an employee at Facebook and a recruiter informed me after a couple of days that I had to pass a 30 minutes writing test. After I passed the test, the recruiter sent me an email asking my availability for a 20-30 minutes phone call. When we had the phone interview, that lasted almost 15-20 minutes, the recruiter was very helpful and polite. She was trying to…  have a nice conversation and enlighten me about the next steps. Since there is an confidentiality agreement for the next steps I can't share more information.

It's was nice and helpful. The recruiter it was very nice and clear. You can get easy what will be next step. No estress yourself, be yourself in every question. Prepare yourself for the interview is plus.

Classic model of CV screening through a phone call, followed by a language and maths/logic assessment. Then a call to go through the position specifics, and a final 3-round interview with leads and potential peers.The first 2 rounds are fine, then the last one shows it what it is all about. Just the classic "good cop/bad cop" thing, and it is clear that the interviewers don't care about your answers.…  Later on, you realize that the guy who interview you approved someone he referred himself. It is a joke, as any other company. I wonder why wasting their own money with these processes (and time of people who are looking for a job), when the guy who is gonna work there has been already chosen.Do not waste your time if you are not friends with someone who works in the same department. They won't let you in, no matter how brilliant your interview was.I don't feel sad for not being approved. Some of the interviewers are so full of themselves, even though they barely have command of English language. It must be really hard to work with this kind of people.

I applied online and someone from Facebook contacted me within 2 days, giving me an initial test.8 multiple choice analytical questions and 2 language components (1 comprehension & 1 written).The last question (written question) should be answered in the market language that you are applying for (200 - 400 words)

I applied online (at the Facebook Career page) and received an email from a Facebook recruiter a week thereafter. I received an invitation to do an online test which consist of 10 questions (6 statistical questions, 2 mathematical questions, 1 language comprehension, 1 essay question to be answered in the language you applied for). You will have to complete the test within a week from the date the test was…  sent to you.The recruiter called me up for a phone interview which lasted about 30 minutes. I was asked about my understanding of the job role and few other market trend questions. The recruiter then proceeded to summarize what exactly the job expects from you. Subsequent to that interview with the recruiter, I was scheduled for 2nd phone interview with Market Specialists, which was rather gruesome I must say. They expect you to think critically and outside the box.

First I received a phone call and an email to schedule an interview by phone. I also had to make a very tough analytical test. I succeed to the test, but I wasn't selected for another interview...

Started of with a phone interview to gauge my motivation and understanding of the role. This was pretty simple and took only about 30 min. When this was done I did an online test, which consisted of 10 questions about algebra, critical thinking, writing and statistics. You'll have just enough time (90mins i think) to finish this.After finishing these I got a call back for Skype interviews. I can't say…  too much about the interviews because of confidentiality.

I applied through Facebook's career page and got an email a few days after asking me to complete an online test. The test consists of 10 questions - 8 analytical and 2 language related questions. Analytical questions include statistics, graphs and problem solving. For the language questions, the first one was an interpretation of an English text and the second one was an essay to be answered in the language…  you were applying for. After a week, they emailed me scheduling for a phone interview. The phone interview was about your profile and what you know about Facebook. Be prepared to answer questions about your market, help center, abuses on Facebook, and how to handle huge number of user reports. I'm still on the process of the application and they said they'll contact me after a week. So, good luck to you and to me! :)

Applied through Facebook page. I was sent a link with an online test containing analytical multiple choice questions and one open ended question to be answered in a language you are applying for ("the accomplishment which you were most proud of").

After the screening of my CV I was asked to take an online test. This was a test that measures analytical skills and problem solving + language questions. There were some questions for statistics and the language question required me to write a text with 22-400 words in the language I applied for.After that I had a phone interview which was fun and relaxed. I was asked some interesting questions…  about dealing with reports - how would I deal with them, do I have experience with Facebook reports or Help Centre etc.

**************************************Data Center Position**************************************
2 phone screens. 6 people by both VC and in person on the day. Was given a list of interviewers and what I would be interviewed on.First of all that changed on the day. Different list. Times were changed so it started 1 hour late without being told. Any preparation done in advance was now not in play. Interview was pretty much same as elsewhere. The most important thing here…  is I have still to this day not heard back from them. If someone makes the effort of applying , doing research , being prepared then the least you can expect is a reply to say yeah or nay . So in my opinion their interviewing process is below the standard of most other multinationals.

**************************************Integration Engineer**************************************
The HR responsible first sent me an email and then made an appointment to have a callwith me me in for a first interview. Did not go further. They explained me about the salary but I was earning more at my current company so I've gently declined.

**************************************Legal Role**************************************
Really great conversation with the recruiter. Very casual. We spoke about my work history, how I managed projects etc. i was able to explain without being interrupted with annoying "mmhhhmmm, oh, okay, mmmm" which is what I'm finding a LOT lately with recruiters. We joked around, very casual. The culture seems to welcome this.

**************************************Software EngineerSummer 2016**************************************
On a sidenote: I must say, I am pretty impressed by Facebook and their interview process. Inspite of being from a non CS field and not highly ranked university, they gave me an opportunity to demonstrate my skills. Facebook cares a lot about what skills the person possesses rather than what grades he scored or which university he attended. This alone is enough reason to work at Facebook. I hope…  they continue this culture.Coming to my interview:I had applied online via Facebook portal. After around 2 months, I got an email from a recruiter asking me to answer a few general questions. He also asked me to pick a date within next 2-3 weeks for first interview and asked my preferred coding language. He also gave link to a few resources from where I can improve my skills. They are pretty flexible about the whole process as even they want us to succeed.Preparation resources : Geeks for geeks - to understand concepts, leetcode and interviewbit for coding practice. Interviewbit is a particular useful resource, as they have divided problems section wise along with hints and solutions. Cracking the coding interview.Since I have signed a NDA I cannot disclose the actual questions, however, they were medium - tough level ones which a candidate can solve in 45 minutes. Both were skype based interviews and I coded on coderpad.io. The code is not actually executed on it, however we need to walk the interviewer through each line explaining what it does. We also need to explain space and time complexity for all our solutions.First Interview (45 minutes): I was asked to introduce myself and then we directly moved to coding. First problem was based on array. I discussed my approach before coding, during which the interviewer pointed out a flaw in my thinking, which helped me correct my algorithm. We even discussed in which cases my algorithm wont work and suggested changes to solve it. Second problem was kinda hard and I was not unable to come up with a solution, however I brainstormed with him on possible approaches before the time ran out. In the last 5 minutes he answered my questions. I was pretty nervous during the whole interview, as a result a stammered quite a bit.I was pretty dejected by the interview as I was not able to solve the second problem. However within an hour I got an email from the recruiter informing me that I had advanced to the next round. Yay!!!This made me realize that, they are not just looking at getting the right answer, but what approach the candidate follows as well. I scheduled my next interview after 2 weeks.Second Interview (1 hour): Again I was asked to give a short introduction of myself, the interviewer did the same before moving to coding. First question was based on dynamic programming. When i was explaining my approach before coding, the interviewer provided me with a hint which helped me optimize my code from O(n^2) space complexity to O(n). After walking through the code, and explaining the output, I was presented with second problem based on tree. It was a hard problem, and I had read its recursive approach somewhere but couldnt recollect it. So the interview asked me to first write a non optimal code. Once that was done, he gave me hints, through which I was able to modify the above code to a recursive optimal one. In the end he answered a few of my questions.Both my interviews were a two way process, and without the guidance of interviewers I would not be able to come up with correct solutions. Both the interviewers were very helpful and smart.I got an email after a couple of hours from my interviewer that I got the internship :)Next day I was given an offer, which I couldn't refuse.Tips:1. Know basic concepts of data structures and algorithms. Go through the sources mentioned above.2. Discuss approach with interviewer before coding, if they provide a suggestion, USE IT !!3. Relax and have fun. Its a great learning experience.

Very quick interview processGeneral questions, nothing technical

**************************************Presentation Designer**************************************
Interview was very relaxed. We walked into one of the private rooms and just had a conversation. I showed them my portfolio and they related it to some of the things that I would have to be doing. Interview lasted roughly 30 minutes. After the interview, we went out to lunch and had a mini tour of the new building. After that, they offered me to come in for a…  week trial to see if I was able to handle the work load. I passed and they offered a contract position for the next few months.

**************************************Program Lead**************************************
Facebook invests a lot in their recruiting and hiring processes. Everyone I encountered was extremely professional and focused on the interview process. You interview with a recruiter who then keeps you updated with feedback and next steps as you go through multiple peer & manager interviews. Interviews did not focus much on reviewing resumes and asking typical HR interview questions - the emphasis was on how you would apply your…  skills and talents to the role you were seeking. I had a total of eight interviews.

**************************************Software Engineer, Android**************************************
I applied through a site (Facebook careers).After that (~3 weeks since I've applied via site) recruiter emailed me and the process took 1,5 weeks - interviewed at Facebook in May 2014.Interview Details – Facebook recruiter emailed me and asked me to fill questionnaire(about my favorite languages, current living country, interviewing with other companies and progress, time constraints and a few base android questions ), then called me. After phone review,…  she arraged an interview with an facebook engineer. I had skype interview. Interviewer was really polite and warm guy. Firstly he called me by phone and then suggest continue via skype[He was late for 6 minutes]. He told me about his work at Facebook and gave me hints about question.

**************************************Content Producer**************************************
A recruiter messaged me on LinkedIn, there was a quick pre-screen followed by a call with the hiring manager, then a nearly day long interview on campus with key team members that will interact with this role. Everyone I met was friendly and professional, and the interview process felt more like a series of good conversations about stuff I enjoy talking about anyway. After the in person, I was contacted…  by a recruiter to see if there were any competing offers and to let me know the timeline for moving forward.

**************************************Market Specialist, Community Operations Interview**************************************
Quick phone screen first with the recruiter, then phone interview with one team member from respective team, last round with a quick presentation about the market you are applying for and 3 interviews in a row with different team members/managers. People make you feel very welcome and are very friendly so that the interview experience does not feel pressuring at all.

**************************************Finance**************************************
Lots of emails. Spoke mostly to HR, learned more.about the role and found that it was not what I had interpreted. Both I and the.Hiring rep thought it would best to stop at that point. Very friendly and informative.

I interviewed with Facebook back in July, 2012 but didn't pass the initial phone interview because my background wasn't an exact fit for the position that I applied. I guess they retained my resume in their database. When this position opened, a recruiter contacted me via email, asking me if I was interested in this position. Of course I am because it's Facebook. So we quickly set up a phone…  interview. One day after our initial phone interview, the recruiter contacted me and wanted to set up another phone interview for me with the hiring manager. I talked with the hiring manager for about 25 mins over the phone. It only took me about one week from the initial email from recruiter to the phone interview with hiring manager. But now it has been 2 weeks since I talked with the hiring manager, and I haven't heard anything from Facebook again. No rejection, no emails about next step. I emailed the recruiter twice to follow up but never get any response. But luckily I currently have a job and I am also interviewing with other companies. If I hear back from Facebook, it'll be a pleasant surprise. But I have decided to move on.

**************************************User Experience Researcher**************************************
Caveat: I was referred internally.1. Call from recruiter. We talked about my experience, plans for the future, and why Facebook for half an hour.2. 45 min teleconference interview with a research manager. I was given a hypothetical problem and was asked to go through my research process.Manager: "Think about your favorite app besides Facebook."Me: "app A is my favorite because of x,y,z."Manager: "Imagine that this app has not been released…  yet." Walk me through how you would research the user experience."3. I was told I made it to the final round. The recruiter send me a research challenge 3 days before the onsite. It asked me to think about a UX issue with FB and come up with a research plan that I would then present to multiple researchers at Facebook.4. The onsite. I presented my research plan for 45 min, including questions. After that I had a 20 min break to relax. Then I had back-to-back 1:1 interviews with two people in the room besides me: the main interviewer and a trainee. They asked me to justify details about my research plan and had me come up with research processes and plans for hypothetical situations.

I was referred by an employee. I had a phone-screen interview with a recruiter that went very well. She said she wanted to move me to the next step. But then, she didn't get back to me about it. I followed up several times, even running into her at an event three months later where, without being prompted, she said, "oh, right, I need to get back to you." She…  never did follow up. It wasn't until almost a year later when I decided to email her again that I got the "you didn't have the experience we were looking for" reply. How disrespectful to give candidates the silent treatment instead of being forthcoming.

It is a three stage process interview, although I did not make it past the second interview. The first was a regular chat with a recruiter who gave me a bit of info about the position and asked about my background. The second was a skills interview with a researcher. This was a tough interview, in my honest opinion. They didn't ask anything that I thought was entirely unusual, but…  it was difficult to gauge their response. I felt there were several ways to answer the question, but they wanted me to stick to one. I also did not get a clear explanation about the type of person they were looking for, but perhaps that was intentional. The third stage would have been a presentation to be done remotely based on something they would have given me a week to prepare.

There was a phone screen with the recruiter then a couple days later I had a video conference with a researcher at facebook.The recruiter gave me a lot of great information about what to expect from the process, which was pretty accurate for the stage I got to. The recruiter read off a list of research methods and asked me to indicate my level of knowledge for each. The recruiter…  mentioned it was important I be honest about how confident I feel with each method. That statement made me start questioning my competency on some of the methods I'm not as strong in, when in reality I am an expert in all of them. I feel like the way the recruiter asked the question was meant for the candidate to second-guess their competency.The video conference with the researcher was a little nerve-wracking and also messed with my head. I have several years of research experience, but the researcher asked me two hypothetical questions (which I wasn't expect to be asked until onsite interview stage) and while I was answering how I would solve a research scenario, the researcher kept a straight-face and probed with follow up questions that made me feel like I was answering incorrectly which of course made me feel less confident about my answers and I'm sure that came across in the interview.I should mention this was my first interview in over two years and I was a little nervous, so this could be why I didn't do as well as I thought I would. I have interviewed at Google for a user researcher position and wasn't asked hypotheticals until I was onsite. I was allowed to work on the white board and had more time to answer them. I was surprised to get these types of research scenarios in a phone interview. That's the main reason why I think it was difficult.

A friend referred me to Facebook and about 2 weeks later I received an email asking for times the recruiter could speak with me. I replied within an hour giving over half of the work hours of the following week (and yes I was in the same timezone). I did not hear back. At the end of Wednesday I sent my availability for the following week and got an out…  of office reply. A day after the previous email said she would be back I sent ANOTHER email. Over the next 48 hours we agreed on a time to speak the next week. I never actually spoke with her because by the day we were scheduled for I had gone through the whole interview process with 2 companies and was negotiating offers.

I met a recruiter at a conference and I submitted my resume directly to them. A month later I had my first phone interview with one of the hiring managers at their HQ in Menlo Park. The interview was about 30 minutes and consisted of questions about why I want to work at FB, what my research interests are, and what research methods I use. I was also asked what…  I might want to work on at FB. A few weeks later I had a video interview with one of the UX researchers in Menlo where they asked me to pick a product, identify a UX problem, and describe how I would conduct research. A couple of weeks later I was told that I had made it to the final round of interviews which consisted of going on site to Menlo Park. Part of the final round involved getting a research problem 48 hours before the interview that I needed to prepare a talk on how I would design the research. On site I was there from 9am to 3pm, where I gave my talk, answered questions about my research design, and then had four seperate ~40 minute interviews. Questions in the individual interviews addressed my research interests, my interests in broader current issues around UX and communication technology, and personal working style and collaboration style. Everyone was really nice, the campus is an amazing place to visit, and the food was excellent.

1) The recruiter emailed me about doing an initial 30-minute phone screen with them2) A 45-minute interview with a UX Researcher3) The onsite interview at Facebook Headquarters with a presentation and 3 1-on-1 interviews (completely paid for btw!)Although nerve-racking, I really enjoyed the interview process. The recruiter kept me up-to-date every step of the way and was very supportive. Prepare yourself for the presentation very very well - it is…  like a dissertation defense, no joke. You must know how to defend what you choose to present in front of the interviewers. However, I really enjoyed talking to each one of them - it was more like a conversation than an awkward, forced interview.

A recruiter first contacted me after submitting my application via an internal referral. Chatted with recruiter for 40 mins re. my experience and questions for the job. Was very thorough. Then 3 weeks later a face to face video interview was scheduled to assess my technical skills. The interviewer was very efficient and professional. During the video interview, all questions were behavioral and technical, none touched on my past experience.

Was contacted by two different recruiters at different points in the year. Initial phone screen was about 30 minutes long and comprised of general questions about career and interests, as well as rating one's expertise level in various methods. Next step was to take a 45-minute video call interview with a researcher to run through a simulated scenario of a research project. Last step was an on-site interview that started…  with a 45-minute research presentation (you have 3 days days to prep, but was pretty difficult given that I had a day job) with Q&A, lunch with a researcher, and four 1:1 interviews that were 45-minutes each. Recruiters were nice and helpful. Panel members had various backgrounds and experiences, and would engage depending on how familiar they were with your background or skills (some friendly, others not as much...but general feeling of being rushed and pressed for time). Decision was made in a few days, but no feedback provided from final round (also noticed that recruiter copy-pasted a template email based on the differences in fonts which made it more impersonal).

Too much reliance on remote means of assessing the candidate. The initial senior-level interviewers were spot-on, then was handed off to a few 'worker-bees' that truly did not have enough background and experience to look for very constrained sets of responses that they understood. Don't leave interviewing to junior-level associates!

First spoke with hiring recruiter, to determine if I was interested. Second interview was by a video conference with a researcher, where I talked about my experience and was given hypothetical research scenarios and how would I address them. Third interview was a visit to the Facebook campus, where I had a panel presentation/interview followed by four individual interviews.

Initial 30 minute call with HR contact to learn about position and talk about my skills and experiences. Two weeks later, I had a second interview which was a one hour BlueJeans session with UX Lead in a different city from the actual position which was strange. Interview involved choosing a product that I liked and given a hypothetical situation where I would have to conduct a user study on…  this product. Did not get the position, and the HR contact nor the UX Lead have responded to requests for feedback regarding the interview process.

I met some researchers at a conference. From there I had a phone interview with a recruiter and then a screening with a market researcher. They flew me in to the campus for a day of four interviews and a presentation. The presentation topic was fairly open so that I could put my own spin on it. The interviews were very case-based and hypothetical. The recruiter was very prompt throughout…  the two-month process in getting back to me after each step was completed.

1. Call with recruiter.2. Call with a UX Researcher.3. Open problem 48 hours before the interview.4. On-site: Presentation + 4 InterviewsI had fun during the process. I loved the conversation with other UX Researchers and the interview went very well. However, after the interview the recruiter informed me that they went the other way. No regrets, it was a lot of fun. Facebook seems to be doing really interesting stuff.…  I found another great opp., but good luck!

It was a long interview process, but an enjoyable experience nonetheless. The first involved a phone call with a recruiter, she was incredibly friendly and referred me to the next call to talk about my work. The second call I was a bit nervous, but as soon as I spoke to the designer on the phone I immediately calmed down and he made the process feel very easy, like I…  was talking to a friend. Be sure to know all possible answers to questions about your designs. The next call was about critiquing a popular app so be prepared to analyze and answer questions about that! All in all it was a good process, I didn't get hired but I will be open to trying again in the future!

Screening + 2 Phone interviews + On-site

I applied through an employee referral and the process took 1 months - interviewed at facebook in Dec. 2013First, I had a screening interview and after that i got a test about a research question (48hr).It wasn't difficult for me. i'm looking forward for next steps about 2weeks but they didnt give any answer.although i didn't get an offer I had a good experience.

Referral from current employeePhone call with recruiterPhone call with other researchersOn campus interview

Seemed like a fun place to work, although the team seems a bit too serious/intense for their own good...

I was contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn and we had an initial phone screening where I was asked questions about my experience. The recruiter told me a little about the company benefits and then briefed me for the next interview which would take place over a phone call. The call took place at around 7pm in the evening (UK time) with a staff member in one of the US…  offices.The recruiter messed me about a little arranging a call for a particular date (which I spent time preparing for) and then nobody called or got in touch to tell me it was not happening. The next day I got an official email from somebody at Facebook with details about a video conference call (the recruiter told me it would be by phone) and it was properly arranged for five days later.The video call interview itself was good and quite relaxed. The recruiter was meant to have asked me a series of questions about my skill set previously (qualitative vs quantitative research strengths) which had not been completed so the interviewer had to rush through that part. The answers you give influence the questions they ask you in the interview. Subsequently, because this bit was rushed, I was categorised as more of a qualitative researcher, which isn't really accurate. They might have established that with a bit more time to talk about my skill set.The interviewer asked me about an app I liked, then gave me a scenario about how I would plan a research project in three weeks to answer an engagement question.One piece of advice: listen to the pre-interview instructions about not preparing beforehand. Because I spent time preparing, I ended up trying to tell the interviewer everything I knew about user research instead of focusing in on the task the interviewer gave me. I knew I had not done my best at interview so was not surprised not to get an offer.The post-interview feedback I got was odd though as it said although I had UX knowledge required they were looking for somebody with more experience in the "product world". As I hadn't been asked anything about my work experience during the interview it did make me wonder why they had not established from my CV that I did not have the particular work experience they required prior to interview, during the initial screening. Overall an odd experience. Decent interview but bad comms from recruiter.Facebook seems like a great place to be UX researcher so good luck to others trying!

**************************************SMB Account Manager (Graduate)**************************************
I applied online and was invited to a telephone interview shortly after. In the email they included several links to do research on the role and a number of sample questions, which was nice.

**************************************Firmware Engineer for Connectivity Lab**************************************
Basic phone screen. Interviewer asked simple C programming questions and I choked, honestly. I've written C code for nearly 30 years so you'd think this sort of thing would be simple but I specialize in studying and developing protocols for wireless communications, something that takes deep concentration and methodical development, ill suited to this sort of test. But I understand the reasons for this sort of filtering.

**************************************Software Engineer University Grad**************************************
First Phone Interview. Was really disappointed with the decision. I wrote the most optimal code exactly without any bugs and still was rejected. I have no idea why. This is the worst interview i have ever given. I think the whole interview process is messed up.

**************************************Ios Software Engineer**************************************
Was contacted by a recruiter on linked-in and then was prompted to take a phone interview with a current facebook iOS developer. Interviewer was a non-native speaker and was very hard to understand which negatively impacted my performance. Pairing a non-native speaker with a native speaker for any language is a huge oversight and probably ends up removing a lot of good candidates from the pool.

Phone interview

While I was planning to look actively for a job in the next weeks, I have been first contacted by a Facebook recruiter (an employee, not a 3rd party company) on LinkedIn – I never really thought about Facebook at first, maybe because I imagined it was an unreachable goal. We scheduled a first phone screen: it was short, about 10 minutes, I said a bit of my background, he…  explained what Facebook is looking for an a bit of the recruiting process. After asking me 3 very easy Objective-C and iOS programming questions, he said he would like to schedule a phone interview with an Facebook engineer for me. 2 weeks later (he apologized for the long delay, I guess it's usually quicker) I had a phone interview. An engineer interviewed me, spending the first 10 minutes chatting of my background, interests and goals, then a 30 minutes peer-coding questions. As usual it was an algorithmic question, to solve in Objective-C / CoreFoundation (NSString, NSArray, NS* APIs...). She said I'll be contacted again by a recruiter in the next few days. I got a call, the recruited said I'm welcome to come on-site for a day of interviews. I gladly accepted. I then started to think I have some decent chances to get a job at this awesome company. The big day coming, I was very excited and relaxed too. I took a BART from the city and then a cab to the Menlo Park HQ. The recruited warmly welcomed me, we took some coffee, and chatted waiting for the first engineer / interviewer. The 4 interviews are as described on Facebook Careers website. First interviewer chatted a bit of my previous projects and then we had a technical question, involving iOS general knowledge, Objective-C skills, etc. Second interviewer spent most of time chatting of my previous projects, my goals, what I would like to change at Facebook if I was working here; and then we moved to a quick technical question. Then it was lunch time. I was really excited about going to visit the campus, get some good lunch and see how Facebookers are during lunch time. Many bring their MacBooks at lunch, have some fun with colleagues, and enjoy their meals. The lunch time was spent with the recruiter. After he brought me back to the interview room, the 2 next interviews were mostly algorithmic questions. Overall, I found the questions of an average level. Some iOS knowledge is required, some good sense of algorithmic, and remembering Objective-C syntax. Many says, and it's true, that unlike other companies, Facebook likes people who can code on a whiteboard with the correct syntax. It happened that I forgot a ; or wrote @implement instead of @interface. The interviewer asked me if I was sure about my syntax, I read again my code, and found my mistake. They are never (at least very rarely) misleading you. If they say "read again" it probably means "there is a syntax error, find it it's a bonus". A few days later, I got an email and then call from the recruiter who said he got very positive feedback from the interviews so he would like me to gather and send him some reference letters. So I did. A few days later, I got a call and was told I got an offer. It was a very good one.Overall, the whole process was of course stressful, but very exciting and all interviews were in a very very relaxed atmosphere. It was like chatting with new colleagues, and trying to solve together a problem.

**************************************User Researcher**************************************
A recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn and via email. We set up an initial phone screen relatively quickly, during which he was friendly and enthusiastic. The call was pretty standard, with basic background and interest questions. One unusual request was for me to rate my skills in several research methodologies in preparation for a technical video chat with another researcher.The video chat happened a couple weeks later and…  was a relatively standard case-style interview, where they presented a scenario and asked how I would approach it. They didn't reference my portfolio at all. Also, the interviewer was in an entirely different office and couldn't give any insight into the team or culture for the office I was interviewing for.Didn't hear anything back, followed up, then let it go. The people were both nice enough but the lack of a reply was rude, especially when it's something that can be easily automated.

I did a phone interview with HR person and a small research design assignment - usability testing plan - they gave me 48 hours to finish it and write no more than 1500 words

**************************************Accounts Receivable and Cash Applications Analyst - 11 Month Contract**************************************
I was pleasantly greeted and collected at reception by the first interviewer. He said I was quite advanced in my career, with lots of experience. Second interviewer very bubbly and very open regarding the purpose of the 11 month contract. First two interviewers very pleasant, informal and explained about the role etc. Third interviewer was very serious and quite unpleasant. Wrote down every response, I felt she wasn’t listening to…  me. Nearing the end, I inquired about working remotely, she angrily replied: “NO! Did your agency not tell you this! I specifically told HR job is based in Dublin only. I’m going to talk to them about this, there were other suitable applicants.OK, the agency will be in touch with you. Thanks." Interview ended there and then. Needless to say I was a bit taken aback! I certainly didn't want to work with her if she responds to queries like that. Up to that moment I felt the entire interview was going quite well, regarding my responses and I didn't get nervous. But following that, I knew she didn't want me.Needless to say I wasn't offered the job, but they told the agency it was due to "not enough industry experience" which is obviously rubbish, because the first interviewer noticed I was very advanced in my career.

**************************************Safety Manager**************************************
Long process.. they want the best of the best. 9 rounds in total spanning across 3 months. Be patient.Be prepared to get interviewed by many people and varied interview types, like analysis round, motivational round, rounds that involve quick thinking but dont worry, you only have to take it for 30 min.

**************************************2017 Summer Software Engineer**************************************
Applied on campus career fair and received an email confirmation telling me I get the first round phone screen after 2+ weeks. I had one question for the 45 min screen interview. Within 24 hours after the interview, I got an email said I made to the final onsite interview at Seattle. Then I had another 45 min onsite interview there in November 2016 right before the thanksgiving. After two…  weeks, I got a declined email.

**************************************Counsel**************************************
Online submission of resume; after a couple weeks there is a phone screen with recruiter who will describe the process and asks for basic information about current position (salary, responsibilities, etc.). Another week or two passes and then a phone interview with the hiring manager. On-site interview follows if you pass the phone interview. You will hear back after a couple more weeks.

I met with six people over two days. I spoke to each person individually for about thirty minutes. Five of the interviewers were very nice. One of the interviewers was a little more challenging. The process was very casual. The group did a great job of ensuring my comfort.

**************************************Content Strategist**************************************
I was contacted a recruiter on LinkedIn based on my background and past experience. We had a really great conversation during the initial phone screen where we discussed all the normal stuff: prior experience, why I'm interested in Facebook, etc. I was asked to provide two writing samples that showcased my writing and strategic thinking, which I sent over the following morning. I heard back immediately from the recruiter about…  moving on to the next round of interviews which consisted of a video call with the hiring manager. We walked through one of my samples and discussed the position further. Everything went really well and the job sounded amazing–I had a really great feeling about it all! The next day I heard back from the recruiter again saying that the hiring manager really liked me and wanted to move onto the writing assignment, to which I was more than happy to complete.I was given 72 hours to work on the assignment, which was very in-depth. The assignment consisted of two parts; the first part was to identify two different content opportunities on Facebook and talk about what information was required to make a solid recommendation, as well as what my approach would be to implement those recommendations. The second part was to re-envision the content for an existing experience. I was informed that the assignment would be graded on strategic thinking, tone/voice, and visual polish. So I turned in a very in-depth assignment and eagerly awaited feedback. I was informed I would hear back within the following three days. That came and went so I followed up with the recruiter. I was informed I would hear back by the end of the week. That came and went as well. Finally, I reached out one last time the next Monday (about 3 weeks since our initial discussion) and was informed that my score was too low on the assignment but was given no further explanation. I was incredibly disappointed to hear the news as I worked really hard on the assignment and was very much interested in the opportunity. Another week has gone by and I still have not received final feedback. I am always open to constructive criticism, so it would have been great to know what the company was looking for in the end. Hopefully, I'll from the recruiter this week as promised.

Was referred & contacted by a recruiter. Process in that sense is a lot like the priority lane at the airport when you have status because they're really responsive and communicative. Then there's a 1:1 interview with a team member via video chat.You get screened by the recruiter first, then you have to complete an exercise with two parts that are then evaluated by existing team members, without any identifying…  information. Then they come back with feedback and if they want to move forward, they'll tell you. But they stress how blind the process is.The recruiters are pretty responsive, the process itself is pretty biased because they're asking existing team members to be criticized by strangers, in some cases, asking people who worked on specific aspects of products to tell them what you'd change. They also want something super visual, but tell you it should only take a few hours to complete the exercise for a role that's not specifically intended to be a visual designer role.If you're gonna do it, just be sure ahead of time to hunker down and don't be overly critical. Also ask the recruiter more specific questions about what they're looking for, they will probably have some insight and can be useful. Be sure to check your work and let other people look at it before you send it, because they're going to be exacting and since there's no way for them to know who you are -- they think this is fairer -- you're basically going to be judged coldly and if it doesn't hit the mark, then game over.

The process took more than three months from start to end. Initially, I was encouraged by the group manager to pursue the position and told that my skill set was right for the job. After numerous individual interviews, completion of a lengthy exercise, a large group interview where I presented my exercise, and two more hours of one-on-ones, I was told that I was not perceived as a content strategist.…  Seemed to me they might have known that from the start.

I was contacted through LinkedIn by a recruiter at Facebook. After a phone screen, the recruiter recommended that we move to the next phase and asked me to complete a written exercise that involved identifying content strategy opportunities on Facebook.About a week later I received a response from the recruiter informing me that they would not be moving forward with my candidacy.I was assured that my work wouldn't be used…  on Facebook. In the time since these initial communications, Facebook has just released a feature which is strikingly similar to what I had described in the exercise I submitted. Of course, this could be a total coincidence. but nonetheless, it would have been useful to get some kind of substantive feedback (or at least an interview) considering the time it took to complete this exercise.

**************************************Community Operator**************************************
The interview Included an English language skills test after which the selected candidates had three rounds of interviews on logical reasoning leadership etc. The questions we're more of logical reasoning . One must know the working of Facebook kind of well to face d interview.

**************************************Partnerships Manager**************************************
The interview process started with a phone interview with HR and then with the hiring manager. After the hiring manager I had other 6 phone interviews and later a one day of meetings with 4 other interviews at the headquarters in Menlo Park. The final round was another phone interview. I had interviews in 3 different languages and also technical web development questions.

**************************************GSS Insight Analyst**************************************
Total of three rounds, One written and Two Technical one-on-one interviews, Written was based on Excel, S Q L and Data Interpretation. The next two rounds mainly were on S Q L Queries and M S Excel functionalities. The last round had one logical scenario based question and general HR questions like Why Facebook? How does Facebook generate revenue and stuff

**************************************Technical Support Engineer, LiveRail**************************************
Interview Opportunity offered by Recruiter from HQFor the interview, I have prepared long time on the technical areas, however, this role turned out to be more customer service oriented which does not involved too much about coding.

**************************************Tools Engineer**************************************
45 Phone Technical Interview. The interview got pushed back several times due to various issues.Coded online. Asked to binary sort a list of numbers.Accomplished within time limit, but I guess it wasn't good or fast enough.

**************************************Software Engineer (Summer)**************************************
Applied through univeristy career site and received an email for a phone interview involving coding exercises. The interviewer was quite demanding and I could sense that he already made up his mind to reject me since I failed to provide the most efficient solution for the first technical problem.

**************************************IP Ops Lead Interview**************************************
I was contacted by a recruiter who explained a bit about this position. Once I decided to enter the process I had several rounds of online interviews with current team lead, hiring manager, potential peers and also people who I might be leading. Throughout the whole process the recruiter kept me in the loop, and based on the feedback it seemed I was one of the top candidates for the…  position.Last round was an onsite interview which, in my opinion, went well, as the interview portion did not cover anything new (repetition of questions asked several times before), and was focused more on them testing my fit into Facebook culture and the team.Unfortunately, this is where things went south. I heard back from the recruiter immediately the day after where she promised that she will be in touch with the decision early next week. After I followed up, I received a standard “feedback was positive, you are still in the running, and I will get back to you…” email. Week after the same email. After I haven’t received anything for a couple of weeks, I followed up again, but received no response. Now, almost 2 months after the final interview, the recruiter did not even send me a “We went in another direction” email, but the only way I know that the position was filled by someone else is a generic FB post-recruitment survey I received a few days back.For a company which talks about and promotes high standards in recruiting, not contacting a candidate with a personalized email, but only with a generic survey, regardless of the decision, is simply bad manners and start of building serious bad reputation.

**************************************Business Development**************************************
In Person mtg with team after preview call with recruiter - met with a few members of the team in one on one interviews, as well 2 members of another team. Overall, it was a very efficient process which I liked even if I did not get an offer out of it.

**************************************Full Time-Ads Analyst Ads Integrity Facebook Hyderabad India**************************************
Through Careers page like anybody else. I applied there and people from all over India too did that. Then I was asked to write an online test of 45-Minutes and I passed that And later was scheduled for an interview.

**************************************GIS Data Analyst**************************************
On 1st day there were 2 Rounds Written Test (Technical GIS related questions), which was totally out of space, next was normal manager round they'll ask you about your current work & awareness about your job profile strength weakness blah blah no preparation need for this.2nd day :- i don't know because on basis of your aptitude you'll get a call. unfortunately i didn't got selected :( All d Best…  :)

**************************************Interview Question for Software Engineer**************************************
My friend who was looking for a job got this question and couldnt figure it out. Let's see who can crack this one lol.

**************************************Fbu**************************************
It was one behavioral interview, very standard questions for a behavioral. There was no technical interview, they just told us a few days after whether or not we got the internship.

I apply online in the spring. They have you write an essay and submit resume in the online application. Then they do a phone interview. It was about an hour, no coding questions and the questions were all about what projects have you worked on, and random behavioral questions.

**************************************Looked Like They Had Junior Slots But Really Wanted Interview Me for Seniority**************************************
Very positive. Super punctual, super friendly, very respectful and fun. Got no match but I think they were looking for some junior slot & didn't really know @ the end what to do with me since I'm @ fairly senior level and somehow they expected things fall into place somewhere or something? Hard to say. Would recommend to anyone who gets asked to run the process (if you can spare…  the time to prepare for the pretty-off-the-mill-do-you-know-your-heaps kind of thing). Only thing I would say if you're @ senior level, let their recruiters down gently if they don't a specific thing for you in mind, e'one ends up wasting time a tad.

**************************************Researcher**************************************
The overall process was very sloppy and unorganized. The HR people were not on top of their game and they even confused my title when connecting with the team for an interview. I had 2 online interviews: the first went well but the interviewer was not very professional. The second interviewer was very cold and had an attitude. Overall, very disappointing experience, given the image of the company. I did…  not attempt to continue the process.

**************************************Site Operations Engineer**************************************
Contacted by a recruiter, who found me on LinkedIn. He asked if we could talk at some point about a position that he thought I would be a good fit for. We set up a time and talked over the phone for about 15 minutes. He explained a bit about the position, asked what my background is, and asked a few technical questions. Although he seemed to really like my…  background, it went downhill with the questions that he asked, which all focus on one aspect of the position (as described, at least). The questions were all phrased as "What is the difference between x and y?"He told me he would submit my info to a hiring manager and get back to me within a couple days. A week later I emailed asking what was up and mentioned that I would probably be a better fit for a different position. He replied that he hadn't heard anything, and that he would ping the hiring manager again (with no reference to my asking about a different position). Two weeks after that, I still hadn't heard back, presumably because they aren't interested in me. Upon contacting the recruiter again, his email address no longer existed, so he probably left.

**************************************IT Systems Analyst**************************************
I came in for an interview, it was a 1:1 interview. I was asked about my previous employment and many other "standard" questions you can expect to be asked.

A college friend referred me. We spoke a little about the company and how everyone there is handling the constant scrutiny. Had a pretty good feeling about things and moved on to a call with the internal recruiter. Again, very productive conversation.Call with the hiring manager didn't go well. The manager was curt and disorganized and from the outset it was obvious that it was a bad call. I think…  they were probably just having a bad day.

**************************************Engineering**************************************
two phone interviews, BST print by level, String manipulation

The recruiter mailed me and wanted to know my interest in FB. He possibly found my email ID from a Programming Contest Site. It was a surprise mail because the same recruiter wanted to speak to me a year back, but never called despite scheduling times on three occasions. But this time he did call and set me up for a Phone Interview. I got passed two Phone interviews, as…  I was scheduled for a third one. Few days after the third, I get a thank you mail from them saying I don't have the right skill for the positions that's open now. Since I got the bad news after the third interview, I would mention that one in a bit more detail.He called on time. He knew that I got passed two rounds and then for quite some time we discussed about the kind of things done in FB. He reminded me that he is in a very responsible position and is the right man to ask for in depth question about FB. His overall attitude was friendly. After the talking, he asked me two coding question and I had to code on Collabedit. The problem difficulties were easy, but after coding he asked me to improve on certain section of the code. There was also a requirement that the code must compile. Now, I was typing on an Web Based editor without any compile option and I am not sure if its considered a big skill to have the code compile on first type. From my part, I would say I did well if not excellent.They mentioned they would consider me when posts open up. Not sure if this is how they mail out Reject mails, or they are considering my positive aspects of passing two phone rounds.

I had phone interview from facebook. The engineer asked a couple of engineering questions. One is how to create class instance dynamically in C++, in other words simulating the runtime of java. The other is an algorithm problem. I can be solved by dynamic programming. Then the interviewer asked the time complexity my solution. Using master theorem, it can solved simply.

Two phone interviews that were pretty basic and standard. There were a lot of questions about how does Facebok work, experience using Facebook, etc. After a couple of weeks I went to Facebook's campus and had 3 in-person interviews. 2 of the 3 were technical interviews. Both of the technical interviews involved problem solving and drawing solutions on a whiteboard. The other interview was a business development type interview. That…  one involved a lot of questions about how I thought Facebook could improve, how could they monetize, etc. In all the questions were fair and the people I met with were very nice. It would have been an exciting opportunity, but unfortunately, it didn't work out.

I completed the coding challenge from Facebook on interviewstreet.com. Recruiter contacted me after 3 days to say I completed it successfully and whether I'd like to arrange a screening interview. Afterwards we scheduled an 45-min interview with engineer. There was another coding challenge there which I haven't completed successfully and I haven't gotten any feedback after interview.

The recruiting team is extremely young and inexperienced, many have no idea how to leave the best impression of their company with the candidates. They don't understand they ARE the frontline representatives of the company

They had a HR person screened me. Asked a few things about why I want to work for FB, what improvements, and am I familiar with the engineering processes etc. There was a list of 6 to 8 questions.When I asked if he read my work samples, he was totally bewildered.The sad thing is he forgot to asked the last question on the list. Actually called me back to complete…  the interview.Very young chap who sounded VERY INEXPERIENCED.I kind of wished I spoke to the technical team instead.

I was in a hurry and my answers where not optimal.Interviewer was in a good mood and dedicated to finding out the depth of my knowledge.

Consisted of a phone interview with some basic algorithm questions and then on site interviews at the office. Interviews seemed to test basic algorithm skills, which while useful, didn't really apply much to the job. I was not asked any coding questions, and the interviewer seemed disorganised. I got the impression the first interviewer was busy and just wanted to get rid of me. He seemed to be picking questions…  at random. The second interviewer seemed bored and kept looking at his watch.

I had two in person interviews. The campus was interesting, they just moved and their new place feels almost like a high school lunchroom taken over by computer-toting nerds.The questions were just average. One dynamic programming question, and one divide and conquer algorithm, pretty standard if you're looking at companies in Sillicon valley. It seemed like they were looking for front end experience in addition to algorithms.

Interviewed at facebook back in april 2008. It was a phone interview on my previous work experience as well as some algorithm questions. I was asked to code this on the facebook's internal interview page - sorta like google docs. The interview process is similar to many other computer companies.

**************************************Software Engineer, IOS**************************************
After a 30 screening call from the recruiter, I was scheduled to have a 45 minute technical interview with a Facebook engineer. The interview started with some basic iOS technical questions (when would you use delegates vs blocks; describe the difference between autorelease and release; etc) then quickly go on to the meaty programming exercises.

**************************************Interview Scheduler**************************************
Overall, I thought the communication and interview process was very quick and professional. I enjoyed speaking with the person I spoke to on the phone. She explained everything very clearly and answered all of my questions. I thought the interview went great but in the end I didn't move forward but not sure why.

**************************************Associate User Operations**************************************
Very nice interviewing process - 6 rounds including one telephonic. Last round by respective India head

**************************************Brand Marketing Intern**************************************
The phone interview began with a few typical behavioral questions discussing points on my resume. The interview then switched to a fairly difficult interview about leading Facebook competitors, specific improvement to the site and its apps, as well as the power of the Facebook brand. I was caught a little off-guard at how specific the questions were since this it was only an undergraduate intern position. I didn't find out…  til halfway through that the interviewer was actually who I would be working with if I decided to work at Facebook and not just a member from HR.I personally did not do well in the interview because I had a running fever and did not do enough homework. If you're interviewing for this position, have specific ideas and marketing strategy laid out and ready to go, as well as a good summary for a few top social media competitors.

**************************************Platform Analyst**************************************
A couple of days after applying, I spoke on the phone with a recruiter who wanted to know more about me and my experiences.Since the role was language specific, I was asked to take an online English test (about an hour) with an essay, grammar and vocabular tests.Then I had a Skype call with a manager and two in person interviews. Most of the questions were about my previous roles.

**************************************Facebook Advertising Salesman**************************************
Process was demanding and though lots of things were done didn't take long. Was proud to be offered because they do require a certain type of person and interview process makes this very obvious.

**************************************Market Specialist, Community Operations, Latin America**************************************
I only made it to the second stage of the recruiting process. First, I got an email where they asked me to write down an essay in Spanish about the challenges that I would have to deal with as a Market Specialist. After that, I got a phone call where I had to talk about my professional experience and my knowledge of the latin American market. They also asked me…  about hypothetical situations and how I would react. Sadly, I didn't make it any further after this.

**************************************IP Principal**************************************
Received a call from HR in CA and had a very pleasant conversation with a recruiter about my resume and skill set. Arranged a second phone interview. The second interviewer was 30 minutes late when she called and had me on speakerphone while conducting the interview. It was a very poorly conducted interview (she sounded as though she was angry and distracted the entire time) and left me feeling very…  disappointed with the process. The next week I was told that they would not be going any further with me for this position. I was pretty bummed because, I really felt that the interviewer intentionally tanked the interview by being overtly obtuse in her questions. It was a real shame.

**************************************Applications Developer**************************************
The HR was behavioral with 1-2 technical questions. The technical interview had one programming questions and few adf questions.Recruiter was helpful and very responsive to the questions through email. She did a prep call to give some hints for the technical interview.

Applied on line, get interview in two weeks. First round and second round are in the next week. No reply afterwards.

**************************************Logistics Program Intern**************************************
first round from HR, normal questions

**************************************Software Engineer III**************************************
Phone call which went straight to technical questions and you get to ask a few questions to the engineer. The technical questions are not bad. The engineer will ask you to optimize as much as possible. You only have 1 hour to do 3 or 2 questions.

**************************************Community Specialist**************************************
The process looks professional in the beginning. However when it came to screening interview, it is not as expected as an/a international/global organisation. There is no manager in the interview so the decision might not be made by the manager, but by a member of the team who is pointed to be the chairman of the interview.

**************************************Senior Strategist**************************************
Lengthy, multiple rounds, focused on a mixture of technical skills and working style. Very fair interview was given ample notice to prepare for it and background information about the interviewers was shared in advance of the interview date. Great at providing feedback after reach stage and was overall a success

**************************************Community Operation**************************************
Face to Face generic discussionRegional Language testIQ testsProblem solving scenariosVery amicable behavior of the interviewers.Had a pleasurable experience.Interview questions were very easy.They just check whether we would be able to cope up with the policies and standards of the company.

**************************************Analyst, Payment Operations**************************************
Applied online and received an e-mail a month or so later. I was asked to interview they set up an hour long phone interview. They responded within a week on their decision.

**************************************Platform Operations Analyst**************************************
Pretty straight forward. A lead phone interview which was pretty basic. Asked about my background and why i was interested in the role. Then 4-5 in person interviews each lasting 30 mins. Each interviewer had their own angle or agenda. One of the interviewers was the hiring manager. On site at Facebook. Recruiter set up everything. Overall pretty smooth and no trick questions or scare tactics.

My school sent out an e-mail about the jobs available at Facebook and a link to the school's job database site. We were required to answer a few short essay questions like explaining how to use certain features on Facebook and what we would change, along with our resume. (It was to test our writing skills.)Less than a week later, I got a call from my school's career center saying…  I needed to schedule for an interview in a couple of days.At the interview, I was incredibly nervous. It was my first interview, and I had no idea what the job entailed. The job description was vague.The interviewer was changed at the last minute. HR was supposed interview me, but the manager of platform operations (if memory serves me right) decided to interview everyone that day, so that made me even more nervous. She asked me probably 25-30 questions, and I felt like we were having a staring contest. After every answer I gave, she would stare at me stone-faced for several seconds until I said,"That's it," before typing my answer down in her notes. Very awkward experience.By the end of the interview, I realized I was (unfortunately) overqualified for the job. It also turned out to be a non-technical position with no room to move up. We ended things on a good note once I started asking her questions about her experience at Facebook. She warmed up quite a bit.One thing I can tell people to make sure they do is: always compliment or have positive things to say about Facebook. Obvious advice, but they really like it. Oh, and don't mention Google or any other company at all, unless they ask who their rivals are. Even mentioning "'googling' something" seemed to make my interviewer cringe. (I made some rookie errors, since it was my first interview.)I'd say the difficulty of the questions was about average, but the non-stop staring made the interview even harder as I had to maintain constant eye contact.

**************************************Hardware**************************************
Recruited with the team at a conference and then applied online. Interview consisted of two phone interviews for their electrical test engineering internship, the first one was more focused on a specific subset of testing and was purely technical. The second was focused on a different subset of electrical testing for a different position. They are very accomodating with your schedule

**************************************Sales Operations Manager**************************************
Had one phone interviewer with HR, one phone interview with hiring manager, and then an on-site interview with four people on the team. The four in-person interviewers were either at the same level as the role I applied for or more junior. They did not seem prepared and simply asked questions as they come up, so I basically answered the same set of questions four times in a two-hour period.

**************************************Technical Program Manager**************************************
It was a phone interview with 2 interviewers at the other end. Recruiter helped set it up. The process was pretty quick. One of the interviewers was in shadow mode.

Initial phone screen by recruiter asked a bunch of tech questions. I can't imagine somebody getting all these questions right, besides the recruiter does not provide any context, just reads from a script. I am assuming this is their way of culling through a barrage of applicants, though very unfair as proficiency in answering some of these questions has nothing to do with being a technical program manager. FB you…  are missing out on a great number of experienced candidates because of your stu**d recruiter screening questions.

Recruiter no showed for first phone interview and was late to the rescheduled appointment. Was apologetic, and once on the phone with him was an overall positive experience. Provided solid background information and asked logical technical questions. Promised follow up in one week.

Contacted by recruiter. It seems like she is just doing initial screening. She asked provided a questionnaire that I responded by email. During the phone interview with recruiter, she asked some of the same questions that I already responded. After our initial phone screen, I got zero response.

Consisted of an initial phone screen with follow up phone interviews. Facebook reached out to me directly. I was hesitant at first given my previous experience with them but figured i'd try anyway. The first interviewer asked me over a dozen times how many projects i've managed contiguously and whether I was interested in the position. It felt like there was a lot of talking but not a lot of…  listening. After my first phone screen I had a second interview with a gentleman who kept telling me how fortunate I would be to work at facebook and that they have the best engineers in the bay area. I feel like I asked them more questions than they asked me and they weren't able to provide me with details. Everyone I interviewed with made sure I knew they were on friendly terms with Mark (they call him by first name) and that I would be privileged to work there. the process was a complete turn off. Felt like I was with children.

My friend at Facebook saw a TPM position that was roughly a 100% match for my skills and put me in for an interview. I talked to a recruiter for about 45 minutes and was asked some slightly technical questions. He told me I was a great fit and he was going to put me in for the next round, and I'd hear back from him very soon. A month…  goes by, nothing. I asked my friend if this was typical, and he said no, and pinged the recruiter. Recruiter was clearly not happy at being called out, but called me and gave me some blah-blah-blah b.s. about having a candidate in the offer process and reqs getting canceled but I was in his top 5 and he'd get back to me in the next quarter when new reqs came up.I started trying to find other paths in through people I knew there, but all roads pointed back to this same recruiter for the range of roles I'd be a good fit for. Eventually I got an offer from Google, and I let Facebook know...All of a sudden they wanted me to come in for an in-person interview.Interestingly, a friend of mine got hired in the same group I would have been interviewing for. How did he get past the idiot recruiter? He knew the hiring manager.

One of their recruiters reached out to me on LinkedIn, and we set up a time to talk. The recruiter was very aggressive, and indicated they liked to move quickly. We had an hour set up to talk, and used the whole time, and the recruiter had to leave the call right at the end of the hour.I was concerned that the position wasn't the right fit for me (currently…  in an executive role within a technology organization, however I have a very technical background). The recruiter quickly dismissed my concerns, and proceeded to continue a technical "quiz show" ("describe for me the TCP three-way handshake and what impact latency has on user experience" for example). We finished the hour with essentially no time for me to ask any questions to qualify the position or if it was something _I_ was interested in.They immediately scheduled an interview with someone in the group I'd be working in. We started the call talking about what I'm doing now, and the interviewer asked me why I was interested in this role. I explained I didn't have the opportunity to qualify the position with the recruiter, and was looking to get that out of this call. After a couple more minutes, we acknowledged it was not a position I was interested in, and that I'd be better off in the engineering organization, which the interviewer would recommend back to the recruiter.I emailed the recruiter back with the same, and never heard from him again. Based on his title and his LinkedIn profile, I suspect he recruits specifically for this role, and wasn't going to spend any time trying to help fill another role.

Many times the recruiter would schedule a time to call me and then "forget" to call. Many more times emailing the recruiter resulted in no response until further pushing either by me or another Facebook employee. Process was slow and dragged out for 2 months before Facebook reached a final decision. Very unprofessional. The actual phone screens and in person interviews were pleasant and enjoyable though.

One phone and then onsite interview

**************************************Oracle Database Administrator**************************************
The campus is scattered around downtown Palo Alto, and parking leaves much to be desired.Initial interview came from the recruiter, which was not much challenging. Next interview came from the senior Facebook recuiter, who wanted to hear from you how great Facebook products are and how much you actually used them, which to me, was not much. After that interview, I was scheduled to meet with the senior person for…  another phone interview 1week later. That went well, so I was scheduled to come in for a 1:1 interview. This was a 4 to 5 hour time slot, so pretty much your whole day is done. 1st interview was mostly business analysts questions/personality dynamic questions, i.e., how you would handle a conflict situation with senior technical staff, etc. Next interview was with the hiring manager, which I thought I handled pretty well. Next interview was with the senior person, which on a scale of 1-10, I would say was a 7. Final interview was with the design architect. To be honest, I have been to several interviews, and this one was no different and thought I did quite well. Got a response 1 week later, saying they decided to pass. At this point, hoping to not to sound like sour grapes, but its a very young company, and they obviously do not have a streamlined and efficient process on how to select people. I cannot quite put my finger on it, the whole process, but there was definitely something skewed. I find it hard to believe that my experience ( 8 years in top 2 major software/ERP firms) was not enough for them ?

**************************************Software Engineer Internship**************************************
Had a short phone talk with the recruiter, then he arranged an on-site interview. It had two rounds and each round has a main interviewer and a shadow. But it seemed that they don't coordinate well... the first interviewer thought I am seeking a full-time position and the second interviewer almost forgot the interview.

**************************************Research Manager**************************************
Overall process was pretty smooth. The recruiter was very energetic, very type A. Turns out it wasn't the right fit- as they were looking for someone with heavy duty international experience. Seems like a good culture to work in but also seems like it could be intense- crazy hours and high energy. Could be good for the young up and comer. Their research group is super small (2 people, looking…  to expand to 3)

**************************************role**************************************
details

**************************************Software Engineering Summer Intern**************************************
I had a 45 minute phone interview. Then they flew me out to CA, where I had a 3 hour interview, 1 hr with each of the interviewers. It was a very technical interview- logic puzzles and writing code. They didn't ask about my work experience or leadership experience, but did ask about some of the larger projects I'd done in school.

**************************************Product Designer New Grad**************************************
First stage interview, phone call with HR recruiter, just the start of the process. Was told the next stages are two interviews, both with designers, one of them going through the portfolio, and the other going through a mobile application and discussing it features.

**************************************Front End Engineering**************************************
Had a connection who linked me up with a recruiter. Whole process took about 2 months. Started with an initial phone screen followed by a coding challenge. Interviewed in person at a branch office, then they flew me out for an on site interview. They flew me all the way out from the midwest for a 40 minute interview that the guy was 10 minutes late for. We ran out…  of time halfway through me answering one of the questions which I guess is why I didn't get the internship. Kinda sucks cuz I was really on track to answer it correctly but it's their loss. Liked the free trip though.

**************************************Site Operations Analyst**************************************
day 1 - phone screen with recruiterday 2 - met hiring manager and recruiter for lunch interviewday 3 - met with 5 people individually for 45 min each (15min break before next person)day 4 - met with 2 directors individually for 45 minRecruiter did an excellent job prepping me for the interviews and really moved quickly since I had other offers on the table with other startups.

**************************************Graduate Programmer**************************************
I applied online, the first screening was done through the resume and cover letter. I had a first round of interview at the career forum, where I had to introduce myself, answer some behavioural and situational questions, and solve a case study (easy). Then, I was invited to an assessment center to have the final interview round in Dublin. It was a great experience, I had the opportunity to explore…  the office, talk with some employees, and live the company's culture. The process included a group work, several one to one interviews (6) with different managers, and a case study (easy). The people were nice, I did not feel under pressure. Everybody tries to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. It was a good experience. What I do not like is that recruiters did not give me a feedback on my interview.

**************************************IT Analyst**************************************
you need to be extremely passionate about what you do everyday..need to result-driven and show your contributions/accomplishments..

**************************************Software Engineer (Connectivity Lab)**************************************
I interviewed for a software position in the Connectivity Lab. Overall a very positive experience. Everyone that interviewed me were friendly, and the recruiters are amazing.The process was fairly typical:- Phone interview algorithm question- On site interview with 5 interviews- 1 behavioral/resume review, 2 algorithms, 2 system designs. There were 2 system design interview questions because I am experienced and it was for a specialized role.I did not get an…  offer even though I did well on all the interviews, but on one of the algorithm interviews I got a little hint at the end to code the most optimal solution. The recruiter was extremely nice, and even called me personally to let me know what happened. This was far beyond what I would expect for a rejection!

**************************************Marketplace Analyst**************************************
Really unprofessional recruitment process. I applied to a position on Facebook’s career site. A recruiter from London contacted me asking for a phone interview within the next few days, I replied immediately suggesting two possible dates. She did not reply. I sent her an email the following week, asking if she had time. She scheduled an appointment but never called. I wrote her an email again, she apologized and suggested…  rescheduling to Monday the week after, I agreed and she never called. Again, I wrote an email asking if something has changed in the meantime (basically 4 weeks after her first message) and she never replied. I was really disappointed – it’s one thing if no one gets back to you after you shoot your applications in the electronic black hole – I get that – but building up one’s hopes by scheduling interviews and then not giving the opportunity to show your skills is just unprofessional. And in case the position was filled - at least one short reply would have been nice.

**************************************Software Engineer Intren "Non-technical Interview "**************************************
I revived a mail with a couple of equations then a call seclude to review all the question I've asked in the first mail and to talk a bit about myself.After 3 days from the phone interview, I received a mail that I am rejected. so I didn't get the technical review.

**************************************MBA Intern**************************************
They came to my campus so saw the job posting on my school's website. I had a first round on-campus interview and was in communications with my HR representative quite frequently. The set-up for the second round interview was very slow and disorganized but after I pressed upon them I had other offers they moved quite fast. They flew me out and I had 4 second round interviews all done…  by members of the team I was joining. I then had a 3rd round the Monday following by 3 other members of the team (there are only 15 people on this team). The offer came through quickly but only because of the impending deadlines of my other offers.

**************************************User Experience Researcher Intern**************************************
The process was:- A recruiter contacted me by e-mail. Did the first interview with the recruiter by phone.- Then two 1 to 1 interviews during a conference (one with a UX researcher and other with a project manager).- 1 research exercise (they sent it to me by e-mail and I had 2 days to solve it)- Onsite research presentation on Menlo Park (around 6 people watching it and asking questions…  in the end)

**************************************SMB Client Services Associate**************************************
The interview came right after sending out the online resume. The first interview was basic HR interview questions, you mostly walk them through your resume and sometimes go a bit deep inside, and also HR will let you know more about the role, HR is really nice and will answer any questions you asked. The second interviewer is a team member, they ask basic questions with some technical questions about…  the product, but mostly just wanted to know how you think and solve problems. The third stage is answering questions online, testing language and products. The whole process was very nice and the interviewers are all very helpful and friendly.

**************************************Deceloper**************************************
Applied online. almost forgot that i applied online but one day i got an email. Was asked when a phone interview would be available. Got postponed once. then the phone interview. fi

**************************************Online Sales Operations Account Manager**************************************
I submitted my resume online as soon as jobs were announced and posted on the FB careers page. About 2 weeks later I received an email asking me to submit a writing sample which consisted of 3 questions and was timed (you had 60 min to answer). Then a week later I received an email from one of their recruiters to set up a phone interview. After that interview with…  the recruiter I then interviewed with one of the AM's out of their Palo Alto offices (again another phone interview). Then I was called the next day and they scheduled me for an in person interview in Austin. I met with a recruiter, the head of Online Operations, a Sales Director, and the Team Lead. They were all very nice and didn't ask any tough questions. I was then called a week later and told that I was a strong fit and they thought I was great but to check back in 6 months.

**************************************Release Engineer**************************************
Professional and courteous. It was even fun. The manager called from NYC, NY and he was very personable. He described the role and then went into basic questions. After which he asked a series of technical questions. None of the were specific coding questions.

**************************************Associate User Experience Researcher**************************************
I applied online sometime in December. Basically you can just submit your Facebook profile and a resume.A recruiter contacted me through LinkedIn in mid-December and seemed unaware that I had applied for the job but wanted to talk to me. I told her my availability and did not hear back from her.I missed a call from the recruiter the first week of January. Apparently she had sent me a message…  that I never received scheduling our interview for that time and date. I then had a lot of difficulty getting a message back to her and thought it must have had to do with some problem with the LinkedIn messaging system. Eventually I had an interview with the recruiter that was a pretty basic HR screening interview.After that I had a phone interview with a UX Researcher. Actually, we had the same mysterious difficulty in which she had supposedly sent me a message scheduling the interview that I did not receive, and I missed the first call from the UX Researcher. (I really looked into every possibility and don't see how it could have been any problem on my end, which was really frustrating). We cleared it up and had it the next week. The interviewer was driving a car during the interview...After that I had another phone interview with a different UX Researcher who was a little tougher.I was then scheduled for an on-site visit at the beginning of March. A recruiter called me the day before my trip and mentioned that I would be doing a mock user test before the three interviews I had already been informed of.At the beginning of the visit, I had 15 minutes to prepare for the mock user test, and then was led to a room to conduct the test while a room full of UX Researchers observed through a mirrored window. I was kind of anxious to get through it and get to the interviews I had spent most of my time preparing for, but I thought it went fine enough. Afterwards we had a short discussion about the test, then I had lunch with the recruiter.After lunch the recruiter left me alone for a few minutes, then came back to inform me that we weren't going to continue the interview because I had missed a lot of opportunities in the user test.Hmm... OK.Overall it wasn't a terrible experience, but I really feel that *they* may be missing a lot of opportunities in the way they are recruiting.The emphasis on moderating tests wasn't clear at any point of the process and was not even emphasized when the on-site visit was scheduled. If it had been, I certainly would have been more prepared for that particular aspect of the visit. Regardless, I don't see how those 15 minutes could have indicated to them that I would not be able to moderate tests in whatever the ideal Facebook approach to moderating tests is. I kind of suspect that there is something else they are looking at - or maybe they just didn't like the look of me.

**************************************Community Operations**************************************
The recruiter was great. Clear, helpful and organized. The phone interview with the hiring manager wasn't that great. She seemed distracted and not that interested in having a conversation and more interested in making her next meeting.

The interview questions are not hard and easy to prepare. Easy interview very straight forward. Manager was friendly and to the point and asked very good questions. She was also nice enough to answer my questions very thoroughly. Both the interviewer and recruiter were very respectful. Took you around campus. Pretty nice place. The entire process took about an hour: 15 minutes discussing resume, 30 minutes for the question, and…  15 minutes for any questions you may have for the recruiter.

Two phone calls - one for background information and second with more specific questions for the position, so make sure you take a look at what they tell you to. The phone calls were about 30 minutes long each and the people are very friendly and informal.

I applied online and got contacted by facebook less than two weeks later.First Round: Was asked to complete two 400 word essays in a specific time frame (i think it was 8mins). One of the questions was along the lines of "In a free society like the US, describe one thing you think shouldn't be allowed on facebook".Second Round: Was contacted less than a week later for phone interview with…  someone on the team. The conversation consisted of mainly random questions. One was "what about facebook would you like to see improved"Third Round: HR took about a week and a half to get back to me after the second round. This round involved another discussion with someone from the team. Questions were more targeted towards Community operations. e.g How would you address the issue of fake accounts on facebook ? What ideas would you implement to address the issue ?HR got back to me about two weeks later saying they were going with another candidate.

The recruiters were extremely helpful and friendly. I felt like a guest - not an applicant the whole time.The interviewers were excactly on time for all interviews. They were extremely helpful and nice. The interview felt like conversation, not super formal interview.The decisions were made quickly and when there was a delay the recruiter would contact me to inform me about the delay. The feedbacks would be delivered within 2…  days of the interviews.The best interview experience I have ever had.

The recruiter put me through for an interview for the wrong position. It was quite disorientating as it was a role I had also applied for but I was obviously not prepared as I had been told to prepare for a different role. When I did finally get the interview for the correct role I felt it was rushed and the interviewer didn't seem to know themselves about all the…  markets the role involved. I wasn't asked about my experience at all and the subject was changed when I did try to show I had the right skills for the job

applied online and received an email few days later. the first email is for the assessment. the test will take 30 min on an agreed date with the recruiter, then if you pass the test they will call you for a phone interview.

I had a phone screen with someone from HR, then I took a test in English and the language I was applying for, then a phone screen with someone from the CO team. Every call and test asked the same questions, so it was really quite odd. It became clear to me during the process that the role is something I had very little interest in, even though I knew…  very little about it. If you get a chance to interview for this role and you actually want it, make sure you have a good answer for these questions and don't get bored and thrown off guard the 70th time they are asked.

**************************************Network Engineer Corporate**************************************
CanadianSubmitted my interview in December 2011Received a call end ofJan/beginning of Feb from a recruiter. Went through an initial phone screening with both some general and canned technical questions.After that heard nothing so I assumed I didn't meet initial criteria.Beginning of September or so I received an email from a recruiter with renewed interest. Again went through an initial "pre-screen" phone interview. Followed up by 2 more technical phone interviews.Finally…  received an invitation to an on-site round of interviews. Was flown to San Francisco for a 5 hour interview. FB covered all costs. It was definitely challenging!! Which is good when you've been in a senior level position for a number of years.Was first introduced to a "recruiting coordinator", followed by "technical program manager" (project mgr). After that came a VERY challenging individual who (being an ex Cisco product engineer) asked some very in-depth technical/theory/text book questions, and did his best to mix you up by questioning answers and presenting potentially wrong answers to make sure you knew your stuff. Have to admit it worked and know I had a couple of epic fails!Lunch with the technical recruiter and a tour around the campus. Bit of a "get a feel for you" session. Following lunch was another 2 technical interviews. Both again very challenging. A lot of "how would you design a new campus network" and "how would you troubleshoot this" questions. Etc...Finally was the interview with the hiring manager. Great guy. Questions about thoughts on change control, itil, working in an environment where there is a limited subset of the former, etc... Some other general "how would you deal with" personality questions.All in all very thorough. Having spent many hours on the other side of that table looking for the right candidate, a job well done. They'll no doubt find exactly what they're looking for... unfortunately I wasn't it (still not sure why, but the other guy was "a bit better of a fit" in their words)... Either way, it was a great experience, and I still have my day job which is pretty awesome in and of itself, just thought facebook would look good on a resume!!

**************************************Summer Research Intern**************************************
I got 3-rounds phone-screen and 1 round on-site interview.In the first round phone-screen, the interviewer asked me some general questions about my research interest and my current project. He also introduced some details about their group.In the second round, the interviewer asked me how to solve a problem they encountered currently. He gave me just brief information and asked for basic idea. He also asked me a very basic programming…  question. If you have solved all problems on leetcode, you can surely handle that.The interviewer for the third round didn't show up.The on-site is amazing. Facebook pay for all the expense. The hotel is great and I even rented a car. Three researchers interviewed me for some research questions. How to solve the practical problems. And one interviewer asked me to explain the idea of a programming problem and write some code on white board. I found it hard to explain algorithm without any code.

**************************************Product Analytics Manager**************************************
First Facebook's internal recruiter reached out to me (probably as a screening). Then I had a Skype call with two analysts (it wasn't Skype but it was a similar tool as Skype). Then I went to an on-site interview with 5 people; some of that product analysts and managers, etc.

**************************************Intern**************************************
Overall, the process was executed very well. Facebook flew the candidates down to their headquarters at Menlo Park. There, candidates received a tour of the campus as well as an opportunity to speak with the current employees about the position. The actual interview was very relaxed and had many typical behavioral questions regarding teamwork in addition to problem solving questions in which the candidate provides solutions and ideas to better…  improve Facebook social media platform or another product.

University Day, visit the Facebook campus.First, check inThen wait for the technical interview, which lasted for 45 mins.Then the recruiter took us to have the lunch and visit the campus.

I initially heard from my recruiter a few weeks after submitting my application. She setup a phone interview with one of their engineers. Overall, the question was pretty standard (Leetcode medium) and the interviewer was really responsive and helped to clarify some things. Heard back a couple days later that I was invited on-site to their Menlo Park offices. I flew out there a few weeks later, on their dime.…  The day consisted of a tour and a lot of information about the program and a 45 minute interview. I signed an NDA and can't say much about it, but the questions were pretty standard. I unfortunately got a bit too nervous and didn't perform as well as I could. I got a phone call from my recruiter the following Monday that I didn't get the job.

they call me by the phone, and we have a phone interview for 45mins , I think I am good and all of questions are anwersed, but I failed, I don't know why.

Applied online, and got an email from a recruiter two weeks later. A week later I had a phone screen with an engineer, and a few days after found out I was rejected. Overall, I was really happy with how quickly Facebook went through the process--definitely makes me more interested in wanting to work there!

If you pass the first Skype interview you move to the second (round 2). Expect to code!I was offered a chance to interview after applying online. I'd suggest reading CTCI like it's your bible because my problem was literally a variation of one of the problems in the DP chapter; of course I didn't study the book. :^)

The first portion of the interview process was a phone interview. It was a ridiculous trick coding problem that I think was just to see how I would approach it. My interviewer was incredibly unhelpful and ignored several of my questions. He seemed very distracted, and I could hear crinkling and chewing while I was working, so I'm assuming he was eating while interviewing me. Very unprofessional and unexpected from…  a company of Facebook's caliber.

I applied through a recruiter and exchanged quite a few emails. Initially I was asked a few behavioral questions through email. Once those questions were answered, the recruiter asked me to schedule the 1st telephonic interview. I was asked just one question which was a real world problem based on Data Structures. The interviewer emphasized on the complexity of the program. It went well but I took a lot of…  time. Got a reject within 3 days.

One 45-min interview with a Facebook engineer about algorithms. Plus there was a tour and Q&A panel about the internship at Facebook. The whole onsite interview started at 11am and ended at 4pm,

Facebook recruiting is the worst I have gone through so far. They are non responsive to your emails for any clarifications about the application status. My HR is the worst of all the bad things that could happen to you. On the contrary the interviewers for tech rounds were really friendly and I got back my results pretty fast. It was only during the Hiring Manager phase when things got…  ugly. I would highly recommend FB to take care while recruiting your HR people. A very big negative experience with FB. I can clearly see why software engineers are preferring companies like Pinterest and Google that have a way better friendly HR.

You get a phone call where they ask the typical getting to know you questions and then two technical ones. I only got to one question and it covered the concepts of permutations and recursion. I had been prepping for trees so was a little thrown off.

Met Facebook at my college career fair. Later I received an invitation for an on-campus interview, which lasted 45 minutes. After passing this, went to Menlo Park for on-site interviews. This consisted of a 45 minute interview and then a couple hours of touring around the facebook campus.

I was referred by a friend and did a first round interview at my school. Passed that one and was invited for onsite interviews at Menlo Park where I had another 45 minute interview and a tour around the campus. All the recruiters were really friendly and helpful throughout the process. They all seemed to be enthusiastic about the company and did their best to reassure candidates before interviews.

Applied online, had a phone interview to confirm my resume. After that a phone interview with an engineer from Menlo Park.The interview was simple and the interviewers were very friendly.

Was asked one question over the phone. I applied online. It was hard to understand the interviewers accent. It was a technical interview. The question was that hard and I got it right.

2 phone interviews. Had some behavioral questions about my resume at the beginning then went to coding problems. Although the easy questions were easy, the interviewer built off of them and asked interesting follow ups which I enjoyed. Interviewers were the nicest and most down to earth compared to other companies like Microsoft or Google.

The first interview was set up in university. I was super happy that Facebook was interviewing so many people but I also heard they weren't hiring anyone. Don't know why they raised so many of our goes. The HR department was also kind of janky where one recruiter was handling atleast 50 candidates leading so late conflict resolutions etc.Interview date comes, super pumped. The interviewer seemed like a friendly guy.…  Asked a few questions about my projects then jumped into technical questions. Solved all of them in the best complexity.Now when an interviewer asks three questions and you solve all three in best complexity and finish in 45 minutes, you feel like you're all set, but nope. I don't know if they're looking for perfect candidate's who have 0 error on their code, but soon got a rejection. (From the same janky hr people who I had to email from my side to ask for the outcome)

Had a pretty bad experience overall. Interviewer seemed disinterested. I was given a single coding problem to solve on a whiteboard in 45 min and the interviewer was on his laptop most of the time. Question was pretty difficult and had a dynamic programming optimal solution.

Talked a little bit about a school project I recently completed and then went on to a coding problem. The interviewer was really nice, and patient with me while I worked through my solution.

Fairly simple process. For me Facebook did one phone technical interview, and then one in person technical interview at their office. I honestly don't think it's a very hard process, and if you put in a bit of effort you can probably get the job. For me personally, this was my first interview and I choked, but had I done it similarly to my following interviews I think I would…  have got the job.

Applied through my school's career fair. About a month later, got an email that I would be going through the interview process. The interview was on my school's campus. It was pretty easy, but I am awful at interviewing so I got flustered. They were really nice about it though.

I applied on campus. Get a 45 minutes of on campus interview. Get two coding questions. I wrote code on the whiteboard and self tested it. The interviewer was really nice.

Applied at career fair and was contacted by a recruiter later. First question was easy, but second question was pretty difficult. Just know your data structures and algorithms, and be prepared to answer some pretty tricky questions.

Applied through university recruiting website and also Facebook online. Received an invitation for a (45 minute) phone interview a week or two afterwards. Phone screen was not too difficult. It began with an introduction of the recruiter and then a tell me about yourself question. Then came the coding question which was not very difficult but I did not answer the question too well and did not finish in time…  either. Received a rejection after the weekend.

Contacted by Facebook recruiter after Career Fair at my school. Interviewed a week later. The process was smooth. The engineer with strong accent called at the scheduled time and introduced himself. I introduced myself then we proceeded to the coding part. A few minutes before the interview ends are used for asking questions.

I talked to recruiter at career fair. They gave me a 1 on 1 onsite interview at school. This was followed by an onsite interviewI talked to recruiter at career fair. They gave me a 1 on 1 onsite interview at school. This was followed by an onsite interview

The phone interview was scheduled within two weeks of applying online. The interview last around an hour and was highly technical. Overall the experience was pleasant as it provided me with areas that i needed to work on.

Interviewer was nice. General coding questions were asked. Took you around campus. Pretty nice place. Interns are not allowed to choose teams till a few weeks before the program. In my opinion too big of a risk to accept the offer.

Interviews went as scheduled.First round interviewer was quite friendly. Explained what he did. Then asked two questionsSecond round interviewer was also friendly. Did not ask too hard of a question. Should have done better. Got recruiter mail in a weeks time saying I was rejected.

There were two technical phone interviews, then three informal meetings with engineers from different teams. The two technical phone interviews were using an online collaborative code editor with a "Run" button enabled in the first interview, but disabled in the second. Enabling or not code execution seemed to be up to the interviewer.The first technical interview started with the interviewer presenting himself and asking a little about my PhD work.…  Then he explained the problem I had to solve. He did not really want me to start coding before I had the best solution. I struggled 30 seconds to find a good solution, then he gave me a helpful hint and I could figure it out. I discovered later that my program had a bug, but the interviewer did not seem to notice it.The second technical interviewer had a strong Chinese accent and was tougher for me to understand. He first asked a relatively simple array question and then told me to run my solution manually on a medium-sized example. This was long, painful, and not really insightful. I also was not sure if he did this because my solution was buggy. He then asked me a harder more mathematical question. With luck and intuition I was able to figure out a very efficient solution. I did not feel like the interview was a huge success, and the interviewer did not seem super friendly.Finally I got to talk with engineers from 3 different teams: a static analysis team in Menlo Park, a very research-y team in Seattle, and a compiler team in Menlo Park. This was always casual and nice to talk with them. They let me pick the team I wanted, I chose the compiler team.

It was a phone interview. The interviewer started with telling me something about his team. The he asked questions about my resume and the projects that I did before. Then he asked me to do a monte carlo simulation and asked me to code the simulation over the phone. The question was not too difficult, but given that we only had 30 minutes in total, it was a little bit…  rush for me. He told me I could choose any language, and I chose to write the code in R. But he seemed to be not very familiar with R . I do not know why we did not use the coderpad. Coding over the phone is not very efficient.The interviewer seems to be in a rush. Usually the last part is to ask the interviewer questions, but he said we ran out of time and hung up the phone without letting me ask questions.

Turned in my resume at campus career event, then got a phone interview a few weeks later. Did a quick introduction and interviewer went straight to the technical question, which I solved and he built on for a second part, which I didn't complete. We went a little over the time and ended kind of abruptly. He told me to wait to be contacted about next steps.

Applied through my school. Got contacted two weeks after a career fair for an interview on (the school) campus. Nice seeming interviewer, well organized. Started with telling me about himself, asking if I had any questions, etc, then moved on to the technical interview. Lasted about 45 minutes in total. Received a follow-up response five days later.

It was an phone interview. An engineer called me as scheduled. First he introduced himself, something like which team he was in. Then he asked some questions about my projects on the resume. After that was a coding question. code through coderpad. After finished coding, I asked him some questions. The whole processes lasted 45 mins.

The process was mainly focusing on coding. Those coding puzzles can be found on Leetcode with only slightly different. The interviewer was nice and gave me hint when I was stuck. The entire interview took about 45 mins and behavior question part is less than 5 mins. The overall process was nice!

Meet with campus recruiter to schedule interview. The interview was one on one with an engineer and was asked two coding questions. The first was an algorithmic question and the second one was related to Facebook's functionality. Afterwards I was able to ask about anything I wanted about Facebook.

Applied online and emailed a recruiter. Got a 45 minute technical phone interview - coding using coderpad. The interviewer was very nice. Told what he does in FB. He said in the beginning that syntax need not be correct. Fairly average question. Coded a simple solution - the exact same as given in cracking the coding. Interviewer seemed satisfied. Asked for time complexity analysis. I fumbled a bit there. But…  gave the answer. Then I was asked to improve my answer. He gave a tip. So I got the answer. I coded the new solution but missed some edge cases. 45 minutes got over!

phone interview starting with introducing yourself followed by two code questions.The coding questions were very standard coding question.Finally he asked why i want to join facebook.Technical interviews can be prepared from LeetCode

I was referred to Facebook's internship program and after a week was in touch with a representative. The remainder of the process was two Skype interview that were both ~45 minutes. During these interviews I was asked programming questions while working in a collaborative coding environment (coderpad.io). Everyone in the process was really nice and professional.The questions started off pretty easy and got progressively harder from question to question and…  interview to interview. I recommend studying the questions on here, the 'Cracking the Coding Interview' book and on Hackerrank.com. Make sure you are comfortable with algorithm analysis (big-O) and data structures.

2 technical interviews, one week apart. Fairly quick turnaround from initial contact to offer. Roughly about 1 month. Interviewers were extremely professional and helpful. Made it seem they wanted to have you succeed.

The interview went on pretty well. I got interview by different people from three different departments. They all asked basic behavioral questions. However, one was a recent college graduate who seemed nervous than me. Overall, the interview was not geared towards experience or what you bring to Facebook but more of your personality and ability to fit in.

First was on the phone on why you want the job. Second is through skype, talking about one app. Third is going over your projects. They were extremely nice and made me feel comfortable. It is the best company in the world to intern.

Got a email from recruiter about a month after the referral confirmation, scheduled to talk on phone then. The recruiter gave some advice and instructions for the coding interview, which was very helpful. Then about three weeks later was the first interview, got feedback after 5 days. Three weeks later second round. The interview process was pretty standard, first a couple of questions about Resume, then coding problems online (main…  part), lastly 5 minutes or so for your questions.

University recruiter called me for an internship. She set the interview quickly with an engineer. The first interview was ok, IT related stuff, DNS, databases. The second interview was about a month later because the interviewer was on vacation. This interview had nothing to do with the first one, it was more about software development, data structures, OO programming etc.

Applied online, got a response back in a few days. The recruiter emailed me asking for responses for a few questions. Then I got an email back saying she would forward me to a phone interview. Here I was asked a couple of coding questions.

Applied on school career fair. Waited for several weeks. Then had an on campus interview that lasted about 45 minutes. The question asked was about string manipulation and I had to write pseudocode on a whiteboard. After another two weeks I heard from Facebook that I was rejected.

45 minute phone interview. Couldn't understand the interviewer at all. Had to have him repeat every single thing he said back to me. Didn't explain the question clearly and would interject while I was speaking with random tidbits that he "forgot to mention".

I applied online and was contacted several weeks later. The recruiter was very nice and took into consideration my deadlines when scheduling an interview. During the actual interview I was asked a simple question. Admittedly, I struggled more than I should have. However, the interviewer grew unnecessarily frustrated and would often sigh loudly. This made it even harder for me to code or explain my code. I did eventually get…  the right code and time/space complexities. It was obvious about half way through that I was not going to be moving forward and I got the email the next day. What I have to say about the interview is that the question itself is not challenging but they expect you to be able to code it and explain it to near perfection.

Campus recruiter contacted me with choices of team I wished to join. Then an Initial interview through campus recruiter. Usual background questions and then two easy coding questions on a shared coding pad.

one round on-campus interview and then contacted by the recruiter. Onsite interview for the second round. The onsite includes a tour of Facebook headquarters. They have certain rooms just for interviews.

I receive the interview offer on campus career fair. There will be a dinner before the interview. You can ask their affair questions about the company, interview and the intern. In the interview day, it just directly go into the code interview. The interviewer didn't ask behavior question. There might be two questions if the time is permitted.

Initially a phone call, interviewer was unresponsive but was quite helpfull. He asked me about myself and then asked Y fb? Then he wet straight to the coding question. I would advise to wait till you understand the question properly . Then he let me ask few questions.

Applied for software engineering intern position at a career fair. First round of interviews consisted of technical questions along with a brief discussion of my past development experiences and why I wanted to work at Facebook. Interviewer was cool - provided hints and asked good questions about what the code I wrote was doing/why.

Had passed my resume to them in my college job fair. Followed by an on-campus technical interview and then a single on-site interview (Seattle- Facebook). They paid for the trip to their office.

Ask 2 basic algorithm questions, using your favorite languages. I used java. Questions were quite easy. And then some behavior problems such as introducing projects. The interview lasted for 30 minutes.

There was career fair at my school where I presented my resume. The recruiting officer got back to me and asked me to apply online. After about a week, they offered me an interview. The interview mainly tested me on my knowledge with algorithms. The interview wasn't too hard but there was a lot of competition form my school.

2 screen shares and you will be asked for one more if they feel that you have to prove yourself before giving an offer. I was given only 2 rounds and they were friends who were asked for one more interview. nothing bad on that!

Initial 45 min technical interviewfollow up phone interview if need be, if not you go to final round (I believe) or a 2nd round.Didn't get the offer, pretty impersonal copy-paste job, but overall the interview process was quick and I don't have anything to complain about. It seems like they had already filled all their positions though, even though it was still only September.

I get referred by my friend, so I get the interview when the recruiter come to our school. The interview is on campus, and before the real interview, there was a pre interview to know who is your interviewer . The problem is not hard, but I think I didn't do it in a smart way.

Such a stellar, stellar process. I was floored by how efficient and enjoyable every step was. I applied through an employee referral after meeting several employees at a conference. Because of NDA, I will remain pretty vague here--but several months later, they began looking for fall interns and a university recruiter contacted me saying she had received my CV through an earlier referral. A week later, we had a 40-minute…  phone interview (essentially a prescreening on what you're looking for, what experience you'd like to have, why Facebook, and most particularly what your research entails). Three days later, I found out I'd moved on to the next stage.Two weeks later, I had a 50-minute Skype interview that was based on behavioral questions, more about my research, and a few curveball questions that make you think much more deeply about research and methodology. I found out that day that I'd moved on to the last stage.Two weeks after that, Facebook flew me out for an on-site interview. Keeping this as vague as possible, I will say that they were so incredibly gracious and did so much to make sure I had a good experience (it would be hard not to!). Everyone I met was awesome, the campus is fantastic, and everything was incredibly efficient. Expect a presentation on a surprise prompt (you have three days to prepare) and one-on-one interviews.When I left, I realized that even if I didn't get this, just the experience of that single day made everything worth it. Good luck!

I applied online through their website. I was contacted after one week and scheduled an interview for the following week. They flew me out and although the interview only lasted 4 hours, I was in California for the weekend. Great experience. Wonderful company. Although I did not get an offer, I will definitely apply again.

Interviewed with 3 different employees on my team. Tons of behavioral questions. Facebook has a culture such that they really want to know how you think.They also emphasize technical skills, since Facebook is an internet services company. They want to make sure you are in tune with the tech world and know how to keep up with the crazy pace it's moving at.

Submit a resume and 3 weeks later, schedule the phone interview date with recruiter.After passing the phone interview, get the onsite interview with 2 interviews. You will interview with each interviewers for 30min. And few days later, recruiter offer the position.

Got an email from facebook. Spoke on the phone with a recruiter and talked about my experience and projects. She then set me up with an engineer for a phone screen. The process was pretty smooth and simple from my perspective. I ultimately goofed on the technical interview (it was my first real coding interview), but everything was well executed on their end (clear and complete instructions and info packets…  from the recruiter).

Applied online. Got a call from a recruiter -she was very helpful and nice. She setup a technical interview with a designer for the following week. The questions were mostly about different Facebook features and apps.

It took about a month. Phone screen and then Skype interviews. The phone screen was nice. The interviewer was very polite and kind. Emphasis was mainly on my activities outside the classroom and what I will actually contribute to facebook.

A recruiter messaged me and I got a phone interview and had to use Collabedit. The recruiter was incredibly nice and even helped me with my resume. I haven't got a response yet as to an offer.

Contacted by HR manager 1 week after the employee referral. The interview arrangement is kinda slow, but the process went smoothly. Two code interviews followed by one behavioral interview. NDA signed, but the questions are quite reasonable. The intervieewers are all very helpful and patient. I personally enjoyed talking with them.

Process was on campus interview followed by an on-site interview. Questions were mostly standard from those asked in the previous interviews. Glassdoor is the best place to prepare.Be prepared to write even more better codes with better complexity and run time.

They hold a campus event to review your resume and give some students a on campus interview. Once, you passed you will go to the final on-site interview. They prepare a very good trip for you on that day to introduce you a wonderful working environment there.

Dropped off my resume at an on-campus event (where I got asked some really simple question about trees) then got an email back from them the next day for a first interview. A couple days later, did the first interview (at my university campus). For the second and final round, I got flown down to the Seattle office. That day was less interviewing and more just showing us how nice…  it would be to work at Facebook.

Recruiter contacted me. Had a prescreen interview with engineer from group I would be working with. Asked questions about resume and 2 brain-teasers/coding questions. Interview lasted exactly 45 minutes. Very chill interview. No technical questions.

I submitted my resume, got an email, and scheduled an interview for about 3-4 weeks out. From there, it was a phone interview solely. The interviewer was on speakerphone and was, unfortunately, difficult to understand (I had to ask for him to repeat almost every 3rd-4th sentence; this caused a lot of confusion in the interview).

I applied for a software engineering internship on Facebook's career website. After about a week or so I was contacted by a recruiter via email who scheduled me for a phone interview with one of their engineers maybe a week or so afterward. The interviewer over the phone was an engineer at Facebook. I was asked two programming questions. A few days later I heard back that I wasn't selected…  to continue the process.

The interview process consisted of a 45 min interview with one of the dev on campus. It was a technical interview with focus on data structures like tree and algos related to the same. I was asked to print all the nodes of a tree in order. Basically an implementation of BFS and then was asked to print the tree as it appears with correct new line characters making it…  appear as a tree and then further was asked to modify the logic such that the nodes are indented to make it look exactly like tree(we see in all the DS books)

Was emailed promptly by a recruiter, who arranged everything. Had one phone interview. Interviewed for the grad-student-level position of "security engineer intern", which I assumed meant more along the lines of network and system security and less along the lines of web security, which is cool but not my area.

So far I have been through the coding challenge. Other interviews next week. I was contacted by a recruiter who saw my profile on LinkedIn. She wanted to talk about full time opportunities but we settled on an internship first.

Left a resume at the college career fair and got an email to schedule for an interview. They had a reception where I met the interviewer. It was supposed to be a 45 minute interview, but I went over to about an hour.

There was an on-campus interview and an onsite. Both were relatively painless. The questions were reasonable; they're trying to get a gauge of how you solve problems, not necessarily if you can solve the hardest problems.

On campus interview

I've submitted my resume during one of the career fairs, and my recruiter emailed me back within a month. I had two interviews at school on two different days, and the decision was emailed back to me within a week. From then on, I was connected with a recruiter, who scheduled my flight and asked about my preferences...

Met a recruiter at a career fair. Super nice, and seemed to get really interested once I mentioned that I wanted to do work relating to infrastructure. I got an on-campus interview after that, which was very straightforward. Mostly talked about projects, and the one technical question I got was basically just implementing a DFS. Thought I did well in the interview, but my recruiter never got back to me.

Phone interview, guy was really nice and wasn't personally familiar with the language I was coding in (which was fine)

I applied to Facebook at Career Fair in my university. They contacted me for on-campus interview about a week or two later.

The process is usually starts with a portfolio review. I did this when Facebook visited my campus and I got an interview slot with them. They sat with me in a room and went through my online portfolio. I showed mostly work that I did from a previous internships, which they seemed to like because it was very applicable to facebook. Then after the interview, I had a phone interview…  where they asked me to critique an existing app. I talked about things I would change, things I would tweak, what worked well what didnt, etc.

Applied online, was surprised to hear back a few months later. I was asked about my projects and then asked a technical question that at the time, I had no idea how to solve. The interviewer was very nice and she helped me through it. I did not recieve an offer but only because I did not know what I was doing at the time and did not know how…  to solve technical problems.

I was given one problem for 45 minutes, it's a string parser. not hard, but the board was no larger than 27inches, there is no way the solution will fit in such a small board. then the interviewer suggested that to bring you own white board pen to the interview, so that you can write in smaller font

Had two interviews. Both technical, and on-campus (at my college). Second interview was harder than the first.

Two-round on-campus interview. Received offer several days later

A friend referred me, and I had to take up their online programming test. They readily scheduled a phone interview, which went well and within an hour I received a mail asking for time to schedule the second. The second one also went well, and they offered me the job after 3-4 days.

I met them at Career fair and I got call in one week as they came for on campus interviews. For internship, I had two rounds of interviews. The interviews were basic programming/algorithm questions. The interviewer was calm and cool. He observed whether I write code without getting stuck in between.

I was referred to the position from a previous interview at another company. They were looking to fill the position relatively quickly. I had a phone interview with two people in the department, then had in person interview with three people in the department.

I had 2 phone screens before I got internship offer. Both had the same format - first 5 minutes talking about my experience, then ~30 minutes of coding questions. My interviewers were nice, smart and asked only reasonable questions. After each interview I had couple more minutes to ask my own questions and learn something about Facebook.

I did a phone screening with facebook after talking with them at the career fair. The recruiters were very friendly, but the phone screener was one of the most unfriendly people I have met during my interview process. She didn't even bother introducing herself or talking to me and seemed like she was just reading questions off a sheet of paper.She asked about the difference between an array list and…  a vector, and some more short, concrete (no algorithms) java questions.Afterwards, she asked me to do a facebook puzzle, but it was such a bad experience that I didn't bother.

This was for a Data Engineering intern position in London.One initial phone screen for fit and then 2 coding interviews using Coderpad. First one was SQL, second one Python.I suggest using LeetCode for practice questions. Be familiar with Coderpad and programming on the phone. Get the fundamentals right as they aren't asking very difficult technical questions.

I applied online for software engineering positions. Recruiter contacted me after one month. Recruiter asked me questions about my background and programming habits. Then we scheduled an technical phone interview. Technical interviewer was very friendly.

Skype interview with an engineer. He didn't seem to be interested on what I was talking and wasn't really helpfull. The hint he gave was hard to understand and he didn't try to change it. He also got me confused by fixing the question in the middle of the interview.

Referral by a friend, received email from the recruiter the next day. Scheduled an interview 2 week later. Did over hundreds of leet code questions and read the entire CTCI book preparing for the interview. Nailed all of the interview questions and coding question, and got a rejection email the next day.Don't know why.

I applied online. The interview process: initial hr screening, followed by 2 technical phone interviews. Unfortunately, on my 2nd technical interview I just had a very bad day, but the guys I talked to were great. Because of signed NDA, I can't say anything about the questions I had in those interviews. The interviews were very interesting and that the interviewers were really great.

Firstly there was a online coding round in which only one question was there and was pretty easy. Then It was followed by 2 telephonic interviews. It was a 45 min interview in which first I was asked 3 coding questions then the interviewer asked about my previous projects.

I received a mail which had questions like how many hours do you spent on coding and all that basic question. Then after that I had a telephonic round followed by a coding round and then another telephonic round.

3 weeks after I sent my application I was contacted by a recruiter for further details. One week later I had my first interview. It was with a recruiter, no technical questions. Passed it successfully. So, I was offered the chance for Skype interviews with a Software Engineer. Interesting problem, approachable questions, but insufficient time.

Interview was in the morning, and at the end of the first one I was told that I passed to the final round which was going to be the next day. I waited 2 weeks to receive an answer after the last interview. Overall interviewers were really helpful and open.

Very smooth and enjoyable interview process. Everything was well explained and I knew what to expect at each point. I was also able to move as fast or as slow as I wanted through the process which was nice. Interview questions were good, but weren't too difficult (about what you would expect in terms of difficulty). Two technical interviews followed by a phone screen.

First level was hackerrank coding question named balances.Second was a telephonic interview which lasted for an hour.The third and final round was a video call. This is the most tricky one, they just dont want correct answer but also a coding standard they could like.

Applied online and confirmed my details with the recruiter. I then had to do a timed test online which involved an algorithm question. I did not manage to finish in time provided so I did not continue any further.

There were a series of interviews, three by phone and one face by face, they are very interested in your personal goals and expectations than your ability, they also are very interested in the area you want to be involved in.

i got to them through the university. HR phone interview and then technical interview via phone. not rly hard questions.very nice interviewers, and they gave an answer pretty quickly.I had to build a search binary tree, and two more questions using arrays and lists.

I had one interview for an internship position at Facebook. The interview question was very basic. I got the correct output for all the test cases the interviewer had. Unfortunately I still didn't get the internship.

Sent in my cv, e-mailed back by HR recruiter to ask a few more questions. Had a phone interview with HR recruiter to confirm answers to questions, and ask a bit more about interests, experience. Approximately 15 minutes long. Told my notes would be passed on to the team in the office who would decide whether or not to further interview me (coding interview online, then coding interview in the…  office). E-mailed back within 5 days to say I had been rejected.

Two phone interviews. First was with an engineer and I coded a few problems on a shared coding site and answered some questions about my resume. He questioned one of my answers and seemed to get annoyed, but apologized after I proved to him my answer was correct. Second was more or less the same thing except he skipped the behavioral part. Few days after that, I got an offer.I…  would just recommend doing LeetCode practice. Questions weren't too difficult, but they're looking for quick thinking.

After I apllied I got a mail from a recuiter asking me general question about my self to answer. after this we talk on phone also about my background and intrests. After this step I was asked to give him times that I can do a phone/screen techniqal intreview via skype with an engineer in facebook. He was very kind and give me some information about the position and about…  facebook office in Tel-Aviv.after this we move to a coding question. after this I have to complete an on-site intreview. no done yes

Good, the interviewer was helpful. One has to write the perfect code on one go. Not much help should be expected as the questions are standard questions. This was part of the first interview. I got selected for the next interview. The interview lasted for around 50min. Few questions were asked about my resume etc.

The interviewer keep sneezing, and I cannot understand what she said clearly at first time. The interview lasted 45 mins and extended 10 min to ask and answer questions. The interviewer was not responsive, so it is hard to communicate with during coding. After I explained my algorithm, I just start to code, and she said nothing or said "OK" when I was speaking. She would not give you any…  hint of how to solve the bug, just letting you stuck on it. So be careful on each character you type and your logic.

I applied during Campus career fair and I also got referred by two engineers at FB.It took about 2 weeks for an interview after I submitted my resume. My interview was conducted with a software engineer (my college Alum), and it was conducted in an private room, with two tech questions and coding on the board. I (sadly) don't remember the second question since I didn't have enough time to…  even solve it, but the first question was quite clear. I believe that I didn't get offer since it was my very first tech interview.

I got selected for interview process through University Placement Cell. After screening of resume, I had a Hackerank Coding Round and two phone-screens. I was rejected after 1st phone screen.

Since I had applied the year before, the campus recruiter contacted me via e-mail asking for my updated resume. Some facebook employees were coming to my university to interview in person and they wanted to pre-select people for the interview. The day of my interview, I met my interviewer in a classroom with a huge whiteboard. First he asked me about my resume projects and what I liked most /…  what was the most challenging. He was very kind and easy going, trying to make me relax as much as possible.

Had one 45 minutes interview on campus, heard back after a week with bad news. Prepared a lot for the interview and I found the best solution possible to the problem given (O(n) time and O(1) space) and still did not make it to second round. This confirms the "getting the best solution does not guarantee a good interview" myth and you still have to focus on preparing good test…  cases and overall keeping your interviewer engaged in what you're thinking. Good luck everyone.

I sent my resume to a recruiter. They were coming to my university, so I had two interviews with two different engineers in-person. Before it, I had a pre-screen interview by phone with the recruiter and then I scheduled the interviews. Each interview was 45 minutes and it was basically: a description about the interviewer job, an overview in my resume, two average algorithm problems and then questions to the…  interviewer. In the problems, I gave all the possible solutions, starting by the easiest one. In one of them I didn't see a way, but the interview gave me a hint and it was fine. After three weeks I was called to another 45 minutes interview by Skype. In this interview I got stuck in an easy problem and three days later I got my result by email.

1 non-technical phone interview with HR2 technical interviews, very easy both of them; I choose Java as my primary language, so I coded in Java.I had 2 questions per interview (40min per interview)

The Interview Process took two weeks, in first week, a phone screen, in the other week a interview via skype. It was a nice experience, but I stay nervous all the time, and complicated myself. Think a little time before answer something, and always give the brute force solution first, it's better to give one solution.

Applied online , first received an email asking for more details, then 15 min talk to recruiter. 2 45 min online interviews and another on site . Then another general interview.

I applied by email, then the recrutier contacted me and we had a phone call regarding my details, nothing special. next stage was to schedule a Skype interview that was 1 hour long, the guy was very nice. he explained about the job and then there was a coding question (next there will be on site interview)

One short telephone interview and 2 skype interviews. The skype interviews were not very difficult, prepared a couple of days for each one. The phone interview was about the CV and general questions about my past experience.

After a facebook event at my university I applied with a employee who then redirected my CV to a recruiter. I was then contacted for a 'skype' interview. The interview lasted 45 minutes. A few days later they contacted me with my results.

Recruiter contacted me. Had a three phone interviews. First one with researcher from group I would be working with. Second one with engineer from another team. Last one again engineer from group I would be working with. Interviews lasted 45 minutes. In each interview: Introduced themselves, than I had to introduce myself, followed up by a coding question. In the end: Time for questions.

Process took 2 weeks, applied through a recruiter. Had a short phone discussion about my interests and previous experience. Had a phone interview with an engineer from Menlo Park. Questions were related to data structures & simple algorithms. Second interview was onsite with two questions about algorithms and data structures.

Online programming test consisting of two questions on hackerrank.com.Time limit was 60 minutes.One questions was based on depth first search and the other on simple string parsing.Knowledge of basic algorithms was required.

Sent in my resume and cover letter. Then asked to participate in a over the phone programming test. Test lasts 30-45 minutes. They said to expect mid to high difficulty questions. Only had 2, to my detriment I blanked out and answered the questions but not efficiently.

The process was as expected. First I submitted my resume, then once that was accepted I had to take an online Hackerrank test.After passing that, then I received a phone call giving me more details about what to expect over the next stages.Then was the phone interview, where I had to use collabedit to type my answers to the problem given. I was also asked if I had any questions.…  The interviewer was really friendly and made efforts to help when I seemed stuck.

Recruiter was very fast with all of her communication - even sent me an email the morning of my interview wishing me good luck.A pre interview test was administered, though I completed this the morning of my interview and I'm not sure it was taken into account.Had a phone interview with an engineer, who wanted a 100% perfect piece of code. I produced a solution which worked and was minimally…  less efficient.

Just as stated in the above, a quick call with the recruiter to confirm personal info (through phone or skype) and then a technical interview with an engineer through Skype.

It was a telephonic interview of 50 minutes, which was overall good. The interviewer asked two very easy questions but nothing from my CV. The platform used was "collabedit", It has options of code formatting, but not compilation.

I gave out a resume on career fair and did an in person interview on campus.

The interview process is really fast. It tooks less than a week since the first email from the recruiter to the first interview. The interview is with a engineer and he first ask about your life and jobs, and then 2 tecnical questions. The interview takes around 50 minutes at most.

referred through a friend.

I had a 45-minute interview at Facebook. The interviewer was nice and helpful; he even told me I was doing fine when I really wasn't. In the beginning he asked me why I want to work at facebook. Afterwards, I was asked about my Google Summer of Code project. Then technical questions started (and this is where the interview went in a not so right direction). The interviewer asked me…  to interleave two linked list - a simple problem, but I missed an edge case, then panicked a bit. The second task involved writing a simple regex parser (with ".", "*" and "?"). This really killed me.

applied through recruiter

I applied online and my school had their own internship application program but they decided not to use that. Instead, the HR called me and asked me some typical HR questions, which I was able to answer, and then she scheduled me with a manager for further evaluation. She also told me there would be 2 rounds of tech interviews which I thought was weird of an internship..

The second time I apply, and the second time I fail in the second interview.Awesome process.awesome and very quick: 2 interviews.interview one:Q1)Write a function that takes a list of words as input, and returns a list of groups of those words which are anagrams. Groups should not contain duplicates. Two words are anagrams if you can turn one into the other by just rearranging the letters.Example:Input: ["star", "rats", "star", "car",…  "arc", "arts"]Output: [["star", "rats", "arts"], ["car", "arc"]]Q2) Write a function that, given n integer intervals [a_i, b_i] on the real axes, where the absolute value of the coordinates is bounded by M, returns a point that belongs to the maximum number of intervals. Point x belongs to the interval [a, b] iff a <= x <= b.Example:intervals: [-4, -1] [3, 5] [-5, -3] [-2, 3]output: 3(I soleve it in a bad way then asked for a hing to optimize)Interview two:Q1: Given two arrays, find common elements Then question about hash table

There was only two phone interviews wich wasn't so difficult. I passed them very well.

Small phone screen with a recruiter, then a phone interview with an engineer, I simply could not communicate well enough for this to work. And halfway through the interview I knew it would not work out.

Got great recruiter - fixed me up with interviews in a week. After first interview got answer after two days, after second one after 20 minutes. In both interviews they asked for testing of solution - just going through example to see if solution works.

It started when Facebook visited my University in April. They had a company presentation and offered an online programming challenge for people interested in either an internship or a full time position. After successfully completing the challenge Facebook got back to me in the end of September. For some reason I didn't have to do the HR interview, but had the first technical interview instead. This went well, so I…  had another one. Unfortunately this didn't work out as good as the first one, so that in the end they decided against hiring me. Overall the whole interview process was very transparent and quick, it only took a week from the first interview to the final decision.

Found internship position through school's career fair. I was asked to apply through my school's career center website and send my resume electronically. I was contacted about 2 weeks later to sign up for my interview. The initial interview was only 30 minutes long and consisted of just one coding question and one technical question relating to a project that I did that I found interesting.

They delayed me 2 times and twice the interviewers forgot to call, so I had 2 interviews in more than a month.The interviews themselves were very ok and the interviewer was very approachable, the logistics part was just a pain.It consisted on 2 problems and background general questions like what is "stack overflow" and what is the difference and advantage of continuous memory with regards to the non-continuous one

After applying online, I was offered an internship position in Seattle for 3 month.After a first HR interview checking my background, my programming language knowledge (rate yourself in 7 or 8 different languages) and my professional goals, a technical interview was scheduled with an engineer at the HQ.I was asked to code a certain algorithm in 30 minutes in a phone screen interview.

Interview asked me to answer a programming question on the spot. Had to write out code.

Recruiter sent email and invited me to the interview on campus. 1:1 interview in 30 min. First, the interviewer introduces himself, and my self-introduction. What am I interested in Facebook. Then write the code on the whiteboard. Step by step. Then he asked me if I have any question for their company.

A recruiter contacted me and asked to schedule the first of three possible interviews. The recruiter I dealt with was rather rude and not very friendly. The first interview consisted of two questions.Two weeks later, the recruiter contacted me via email to tell me I would not be offered a position.

Initial contact followed by written test. Written test consists of software problem solving including algorithm type problems. Algorithm problems were fairly tough. Time was tight for me. One should have sufficient preparation, and practice for problem solving and coding speed. Read algorithm textbook again and review common and key algorithms.

I had three interviews; each time they asked me a quick question about my background, then went into algorithm puzzles. The problems themselves are tricky, but you also have to be able to implement your algorithm quickly in your language of choice. Practice a couple hashing questions beforehand!

It was a more or less standard interview.On campus recruiting -> fly out to the campus to meet people.People keep probing you for further questions to see if you can find something more optimal.Both algorithms and coding questions during the interview.

20 minute HR screener asking basic questions of Java features (Put Java as a dominant language)60 minute follow-up interview with Engineer asking questions about data structures and used a system where we could share writing code together. Wrote code to find the maximum subsequence sum over the phone and struggled through an example. Also did another couple problems. Was rather nervous and talked very little about my other non-coding experiences.

there're 3 interviews before getting into the candidate pool. and the candidate pool doesn't guarantee a position or an offer

Questions on LL traversal and manipulation. Questions on String permutations, A very hard question on an infinite maze and a robot (hardcore recursion and expected almost optimal answer in 20 mins)

**************************************Software Engineer V**************************************
Run of the mill tech interview (chat with recruiter, phone/in person screen, then full loop of 4-5 engineers). One design, two coding, one personality/coding question. The interviewers were friendly, some of them looked very smart but others were as usual.

**************************************Product Growth Manager**************************************
I first got a call from a recruiter who asked me a few questions about me. He then gave me 3 questions from the hiring manager to prepare for a subsequent interview. Next interview, I answered the questions as best as I could, recruiter promised to let me know if I did well, but I never heard from him, despite mailing to find out how I did or where I…  went wrong. I'm displeased because I expected feedback about my interview.
