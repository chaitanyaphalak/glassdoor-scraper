At 5 weeks, I followed up with my friend in the company, who tells me that HR told him that they never got feedback from the engineer. They only did this because he physically walked down to HR to ask about it after they didn't respond to his emails either, which went to an HR manager no less.At this point, I've decided not to continue with their terrible process regardless, but I finally got a response.

Four days later, I contact him to see how things are going at their end and I'm told they're interviewing an internal referral, but he thought ""nothing would come of it"". In the meantime I got an actual offer from another company, so I contacted the Splunk HR guy, told him I wanted to make a decision in the next 3 days, and then was told they were now looking at 2 candidates. I hope it's not common practice for them to say they're going to get you an offer and then not follow through. So uncool. A ""we're no longer interested"" statement would have been more appropriate. After that experience, it was very satisfying to send the note that I was no longer interested in the position because I accepted an offer at another company.

Declined Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,8 weeks,Business Systems Analyst,"I initially heard about the position from a former colleague, and the company piqued my interest due to its unique position in the marketplace. I applied online for two positions and was contacted the following week by the recruiter.The first interview consisted of a phone screen by the recruiter to gauge my interest. It was purely conversational and I enjoyed speaking transparently about company culture, benefits, and compensation.The second phone…  interview was with a team lead. This conversation was much more awkward as it seemed the interviewer was distracted and/or stressed. I had the chance to ask a few questions, but the answers seemed pretty generic.The third phone interview was with the hiring manager. This involved more in-depth behavioral questions and about my current experience.The third phone interview was with the Director of CRM. I really enjoyed this conversation as we had shared some previous experience together. This conversation gave great insight into the company's vision and culture.After the initial phone interviews, I was brought onsite for meetings with the team. The onsite interview consisted of meeting six people of the team (team-members, hiring manager, SR Director, architect). The onsite meetings gave me mixed feelings. Some conversations were great and natural, but others were passive-aggressive. At one point, a team-member openly ridiculed my lack of experience for the role.After the onsite interview, I felt very confident that I had concluded the interview process, but the hiring manager contacted me to notify me that I had a week to prepare a presentation on key concepts to the team. This was a surprise to me, but I wanted to demonstrate my passion/interest so I spent the weekend preparing a presentation. After the presentation, I heard feedback that everything went well and that I should be expecting to hear back soon.However, this was not the case.

No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,-,Online Marketing,"My interview process with Splunk was the strangest I've ever experienced, and that's coming from someone who has changed jobs 3 times in the past 6 years. In a nutshell, HR did an extremely poor job of communicating the process to me and dragged everything out for an obscene amount of time, ultimately resulting in no offer. Let me explain...I applied through a friend and got a standard HR screen…  about two weeks later. Then they brought me into the office a week after that for interviews with the hiring manager and the other person on the team... so good so far. Those interviews went extremely well and I could tell they liked me a lot, so I left expecting good news but had no knowledge of whether I should be expecting a decision or more interviews. Turns out I had 4 more hours of interviews with people on crossfunctional teams that I would work with.I can't blame them for being thorough but this is where it started to get weird. The first person I talked to didn't even know what role I was interviewing for and had never seen my resume, but it went well. The next person asked some Google-style questions about manhole covers, songs that describe me, etc. That went well and he even told me he'd recommend me for hire.Next was a guy who flat out had an agenda to test my composure. I've been there before but he went over the top to the point of being degrading. He belittled my past experience saying things like ""so you're saying you bridged the gap between engineering and sales... sounds like you weren't really doing anything."" ""We are very careful about who we hire and it doesn't seem like you have a lot of things on your resume that we're looking for. Explain why you even applied for this job."" These kinds of questions went on for 45 minutes! Look, I get it, you want to see if I can handle the pressure but I felt totally worthless afterward because even the questions I answered well had a follow up that made me feel stupid.The last interviewer was nicer but still had a similar agenda to get to the bottom of things. After all this I wrote the opportunity off assuming they didn't like me, but HR called to tell me that they did like me and hoped I wasn't put off by some people's ""harsh interview tactics."" ""That's not what it would be like to work here."" I was told I would hear within the next two weeks if I got the job or not. I kept following up but two weeks turned to six weeks. Then they asked me if I'd consider a temp-to-hire arrangement. Then they set up an interview with the SVP even though my interviews were supposedly done. Then the day before that interview they cancelled it and said ""thanks for your time"" with a copy-pasted two line email.... after all that!I had a job at the time and wasn't desperate, but I fell in love with the industry they were in, the role, the office, and the hiring manager and wanted the job so badly from day one that I became naive and ended up wasting tons of time and energy. I don't think they meant for things to go as they did, but HR could have been much more transparent about what they were looking for and where I stood in the process.

Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,a week,Education,"What an awesome company and interview process. I was an internal referral, so that probably helped a lot.I received an email and phone screen from hiring manager directly: no recruiter. Two phone screens, and I had an in-person interview. Everyone was very nice, and a lot of it is if you have the skills, they want to make sure you fit in. There's a lot of making sure you have…  your background too.The recruiter contacted me after the in-person a day or so later, and I had the job. The entire process was easy. The hardest part was waiting for the background check to clear.",None that I can think of. It was a very relaxing environment.  ,"Oct 24, 2013",
Accepted Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,1+ week,Software Engineer,Random. Interviewers have different levels. The managers disregard all the feedback and play politics. Week candidates got surprising offers even they did expect. Managers sometimes just tried to stuff people to the team so it looks good in their review. Then there is no opening and even good candidates can't get offer.,Implement iterator.  ,"Nov 23, 2016",Why do you want to join?

Accepted Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,1 day,Engineering Intern,"Went in for a 1.5 hr onsite interview. Chatted about the company and asked questions for the first half hour.
